This is pretty much Town Hall�s Masala Mama on cask and it does not disappoint. Smooth as can be with a finishing sweetness followed by a moderate bitterness. Nice hoppy flavors with a moderate malt backing. I debate whether the cask is better than the standard tap,but I usually solve that by having both.

Fant�me de No�l;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;Brasserie Fant�me;"750 ml crown-capped bottle with hidden cork bought at HKBWEX in Mong Kok. Looks: Translucent deep brown colour a ring of dirt like yeast sediments; Less than one quarter finger head with residual soapy light beige foam which fades in 15 seconds; Poor sticky lacing with near zero carbonation. Aroma: Very fragrant brown malt, with Sherry, honey, caramel, black pepper, molasses, strong spices and dry biscuits. Very winey! Taste: Close to medium sweet brown malt, with tartness, fair lactic acid, strong red wine, grape skin, floral, fair sugar, spices, peppers, biscuits, lemon, fair bitter hops and tannin. Body: medium body. Fairly slick palate. Mouth Feel: Good brown maltyness in a pretty thin background. Dry and full of red winey goodies, with moderate lacto tartness which balance the medium sweetness seamlessly. Peppery spicy, flowery with lemon to round. Excellent! Hoppiness: None in nose, floral and lemon in taste; Bitterness is fair for an abrupt, medium astringent sweet-bitter spicy malty finish. After Taste: Fairly dry. Red winey spicy and fairly bitter to mouth. Comments: In a blind tasting, I would swear this is a red wine barreled beer, and that tells you how good this one is when actually it is not: the wild yeast did wonders by turning a strong Brown Ale into a barreled red wine with right touches of lacto. The honey and black pepper aroma is blissful and the 10% abv is almost non-existent. A marvelous beer for winter!"

Fant�me de No�l;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;Brasserie Fant�me;Pours hazy copper, big beige head with some sticky lacing. Aroma of caramel, spruce and yeast. Tastes bitter, roasted malts, chocolate, dry but fruity, and with noticeable spices (coriander, clove and nutmeg overall). Finish is quite abrupt and leaves a herbal bitter aftertaste. Feels very light besides its 10% ABV, quite easy to drink and not overly sugary like other Belgian beers. Decent, but no love!
Thomas Hooker American Pale Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Can 33 cl. Golden, cloudy with a medium foamy white head. Aroma of hops, flowers and citrus. Light bittersweet with a hops and some soape sense.
Thomas Hooker American Pale Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a transparent copper color with some carbonation seen rising to fill a one finger foamy to fuzzy white to off white head. The aroma had some bread-like malts, and some citrus hops. The flavor balances mainly between the malts and the hops. Well balanced aftertaste to the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation feels fine on my tongue. Overall, good for the style and I could see myself coming back to it when I saw it, but nothing really to go bonkers about.

Thomas Hooker American Pale Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes (2008) A: Transparent copper with slight off white head... S: Mostly bread-like malts, some citrus hops but nothing that pops... T: Mirroring the aroma, the bread-like malts are prevalent, there isn�t much depth here as the malts are rather one dimensional, and citrus hops finish... M: Smooth medium bodied... O: Not Likely to return to this brew... disappointing when compared to other hooker beers...
Thomas Hooker American Pale Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;This has a dark, hazy orange unfiltered look to it. The aroma is a little off - sweet in a way that suggests that the hops do not mix well with the wheat component. Somewhat bitter at start and malty sweet, cloying finish. Like some other pales, this might be very different without wheat. Hopping is not nearly as evident as it should be based on the listed description.

Thomas Hooker American Pale Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle - $1.99 at Total Wine & More in Alpharetta, Georgia. Born On: ... Ugh, there�s a big smear across the digits. 2011... 0-something. 2-something. People say they want born-on dating, but half the time, it�s entirely illegible. Ah well! Appearance: Pours a hazed, filthy-looking, orangesque body with a tallish, whitish head. Smell: Faintly sweet-scented bready pale malts with a thin, thin brushing of candied caramel with some inviting floral hints (maybe a bit of honeysuckle) and sliced sweet lemons. Taste: Pale malts, some notions of sweetish caramel and a bit of breadiness. Floral, citrus hops with ample bitterness. Some near-resinous hints past the mid-palate. Drying, citrusy, well-carbonated finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation, a tad fizzy. Overall: Simple but sufficient but not worth seeking out.
Thomas Hooker American Pale Ale;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;I was expecting not to like this based on reviews. However, I found it quite enjoyable. IPAs and APAs are amongst my least favorite beers but I found this one very nice. It�s a beautiful looking beer and the flavors of lemon rind and lemon juice come across nicely. It�s not overly hoppy which is probably why I enjoyed it as much as I did.

BIG green, skunky hops. Lemony notes and sweet biscuits. Green and round in the mouth. Slightly acidic hops all up in my grill. Skunkalicious with light eucalyptus and some mango. Great carbonation, great weight. Fabulous beer, has a bit of everything and is remarkably light.
Willimantic Glacier IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pours a slightly hazy orange bronze with a thin, wispy white head. Big citrusy and piny resiny hop aroma has some mild caramel malty sweetness. Body starts fairly full with sticky resiny bitterning hop flavor. Finishes drier and bittersweet with good hop character throughout. A nice IPA.
Willimantic Glacier IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Hazy amber brew BIG hops for and IPA I could drink this everyday. Wanna convert your friends this ale will massage their palate with out frying their taste buds. My most favorite and impressive IPA ever sampled for this hophead
Willimantic Glacier IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pours a straw color with a thin white head. Smells of citrus and dough. Taste is of citrus with some sweet malty biscuity undertones. Not bad.
Willimantic Glacier IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Murky, dirty gold with a small white head. Nose is citrusy, a grapefruit and resin amalgam. Flavor follows uit, with a bit of caramel. Nice, even bitter finish.
Willimantic Red Letter IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Clear dark copper body. Aroma is earthy hoppy, slightly sweet. Quite hoppy in flavor, noticeable ringwood. Smooth beer, with decent richness.
Willimantic Red Letter IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Light Copper. Thin frothy head. Very aromatic, with notes of toast and Goldings hops. Very well balanced with a nice crystal sweetness matching a solid Goldings base and some earthy hops as well.
Carlsberg Brown;Blantyre, Malawi;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Castel Malawi Brewery;I�ve shit myself. I�ve shit myself. I�ve shit myself. I�ve shit myself. I�ve shit myself.
Carlsberg Brown;Blantyre, Malawi;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Castel Malawi Brewery;Stayed at doogals backpackers in Blantyre and they had every beer brewed at the carlsberg brewery. There were about seven different ones and they have all merged into one. Nothing special but his and carlsberg elephant were the best.
Carlsberg Brown;Blantyre, Malawi;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Castel Malawi Brewery;Aroma is a very soft scent of wood, barley. Not strong at all. It�s a pretty good looking beer though, with a nice dark brown colour and some fluffy head, though the head could be larger. Maybe it needs to be poured aggressively. I didn�t enjoy the flavour of this brew. It was a weak taste of malts and not much else, a sweet aftertaste, and nothing special. Not dark enough to be a dark beer and not light enough to be a lager, this one fails the mark. Not awful, but not great by any stretch.
Carlsberg Brown;Blantyre, Malawi;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Castel Malawi Brewery;Bottle in Malawi. Tasted more like a slightly malty/sweet lager to me. Too sweet for me, really, particularly in the hot climate of Africa. Not bad in the evening, though.
Carlsberg Brown;Blantyre, Malawi;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Castel Malawi Brewery;This is the beer when drinking in Malawi! Very nice, considering where you are!
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Originally rated January 2007. From Christmas 2006 and with a date best before May 2007. Pours a dark amber with grape-red highlights. Tanned head with average retention and decent lace. A bit of haziness is present. Usual Trafalgar yeast nose with some spices. Mild fizzy mouthfeel with slight syrup. Nice cinnamon spice, fruity orange and hoppy flavours. The taste is surprisingly much better than all of the other Trafalgar beers I�ve tried.
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Good flavour, it is sour and nice shape and body. I like ti and it has the Canadian touch.
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;650ml Bottle, 6.2% a/v Pours dark black with a very tiny brown head which dissapears fast. Smoke, spice and malt in the nose. Taste is unusual, caramel, spice, slight smoke. Aftertaste is anise, nuts, and a bit of honey or molasses. Unusual taste for sure, but will definitely be a fantastic winter beer. I just couldnt wait :-)
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;650ml Bottle: I write this review off notes from many months ago, and I�m happy to report I�ve kicked the Trafalgar habit. I can now have the inner strength to walk by their bottles and leave my money in my pocket. Why waste my time typing here? Dark, no head, smells like rotting bread, and tastes like they dumped all their other beers into a bottle and shook it. Dead to me.
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Dark, dark brown, no make that red. Very thin head that fades quick. Smoky caramel and spice scent. Very thick complex taste. Mostly licorice in the aftertaste, but warm nuts, honey, and smoked (bacon) before. Some rich spice in the front. A rather nice complex taste. No hint of the high alc content. Would have prefered less licorice myself, but still rather nice. Frighteningly l just picked this up, in August, and it lists a best before of May. Somehow seems to have lasted.
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Poured a dark red, with a frothy head. Spiced aroma, and malty sweetness in the flavor. You really have to respect the best before date on this one - when its on its good, when its off its god-awful. What I find interesting is that this beer rated highly before March 2007 (getting scores over 3.2), and declined sharply after that. I�d suggest that until a new batch is made people are best staying away.
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Poured an almost clear deep amber color with a huge beige head. The bottle foamed out all over the table. The aroma smelled like paper and dust. It was tart and leathery. The malt flavor was sweet but very short with a wild yeast and leather taste. Some paper notes. Light body with a very lively mouthfeel.
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"Date: 05/16/2007 Mode: Bottle Source: Tasting never ending gusher, clear dark red, frothy tan head, soured spiced aroma, thin carbonated body, dark caramel malt flavor, lots of sourness but not as much as the aroma or gushing would indicate, only a hint of the spices that used to be there, Aroma: 3/10; Appearance: 4/10; Flavor: 2/10; Palate: 4/10; Overall: 4/20 Rating: 1.3/5.0 Drinkability: 2/10 Score: -/4"
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"650 ml bottle date stamped May 07. Like the other Trafalgars sampled recently, this one was only a week removed from the store, althought this one does appear to be past the best before date. Same resutl as the other though - an ""off"" acidic twang that dominates everything else. Cloudy brown amber colour with a mostly lasting fizzy and frothy tan head. Acidic, lemony twang along with cinnamon and coriander aroma. Acidic twang again in the flavour with some light bready malts, cinnamon and coriander. Light to medium bodied, fizzy and dry mouthfeel."
Trafalgar Celebration Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;i appreciate the aroma and flavor of this brew, but the balance is a bit off. a potentially good beer now tastes just like one of my failed homebrew.
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Country #95, Golden, small head, aroma is not much, some malt, sweet, taste is the same, very light, not much, light sweet, bit dry, meh
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Puszka 0.5l (BB 07.08.2020). Leciutki, nieco rozwodniony lager, bez cienia chmielu czy s�odu, takie piwko na upa�.
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Bottle @ Beerfestival w friends/Mrs B. Appearance: pours clear straw yellow with ok white soapy head and lacing. aroma/taste: barley, bread, straw and hay. palette: light malty aroma, average carbonation, medium body, medium sweetness, somewhat balanced by a light to medium bitterness, short to average duration and a watery texture. Overall: pretty standard
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);I grew up drinking this beer. My very first beer! To my mind - sacred accordingly. Must be drunk cold. All the best case attributes of an African lager, ranking among the best.
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with a best by date of Sep 2019. Golden amber pour with a busy carbonation leading up to a modest then fading white head. The aroma brings out a toasted white biscuit and floral happening but also some kind of olive oil sensation. Light and easy palatable body. The taste is sweet and bready and the offsetting olive oil is not there. I can drink these kind of lagers but there are better ones in my opinion.
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Bottle at Epcot - Morocco. Pours clear light golden with a small white head, light lacing. Pils malts, grains, honey and sweet grains. Ok
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Sample from bottle at Copenhagen Beer Festival 2019. My first beer from Kenya, as country # 70! Sweet, grainy Lager with pale malts and grasses. Ordinary.
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Bottle from Beers of Europe. Clear golden appearance with big bubbly white head. Aroma is malts, nothing on the nose. Flavour is the same, not much to it.
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Genuinely one of the poorest lager's ever tasted. If I was maybe actually in Kenya enjoying a nice safari or something, chilling with the lads Eric Elephant and Gina Giraffe, this would be tolerable.
Kenya Tusker Lager;Nairobi, Kenya;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kenya Breweries (EABL - Diageo);Sample from a bottle. A clear olden coloured beer with a white head. Aroma and flavour of malt, hops, grain and citrus.
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"Originally rated February 2005. This amber ale poured a golden-copper colour which was beautiful. Unfortunatly, it stopped there. Head was o.k. but did not have much retention. Some lace occured. Medium carbonation made of tiny, tiny bubbles. Bigger bubbles were at the bottom of my glass... just sitting there like there is no tomorrow. The nose was of sweet malt with hints of floral and fruit scents. The taste was sweet with a grain (cereal) finish. This brew seems young. It is a new arrival at ""The Beer Store"" in Ottawa. I think I will sit the rest of my 6-pack for a few weeks and age it. Trafalgar makes great meads, but beer they will have to work at."
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"[1761-20081004] Tap. Grainy mild malt aroma. Clear, dark red brown body with a long-lasting foamy white head. Toasted smoky coffee paper flavour. Medium body is rough. Weird coffee note. <br /><i>(@ Tied House; Oakville, ON)</i>"
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Sample from bottle at Black Creek Brews Fest. Pours a clear amber with virtually no head. Nose of caramel with a slight hoppiness. Grainy, malty flavour with notes of caramel, cocoa and some light hoppiness. Medium body with a slightly bitter finish.
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottled. Poured crystal-clear lighter amber with a short-lived cap of tan head. The aroma was quite sweet with caramel, light fruit, and toasted grains.. some almost vegetal undertones.. all in all it was quite pleasant. The flavor had more of the toasty grains, but lost a bit of the caramel and other character that I enjoyed from the nose.. mostly wet toasty grains with a bit of caramel on the short, dry finish.. not offensive, but didn�t really come together well. Lighter-bodied and dry on the palate.. bit prickly on the back, mostly from carbonation.. OK flow. This was a powerfully average brew.
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle from trade with matt7215. Dark orange, thin white head, lots of bubbles. Sweet caramel aromas. Also hints of malt. Light body, Malty bitter taste. Over carbonated.
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;341 ml bottle. pours amber with a small white head. malty nose appears as it warms but theres nothing there when its cold. flavours are malts with good finishing hops. this tastes almost exactly like their paddys irish red with finishing hops added. both beers are ok i just dont know why they make 2 beers that are so similar.
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;dark amber color, about and inch of head, dissipates quickly. i�m not getting much in the aroma at all.......very very slight fruitiness, but mostly just grain. flavour is pretty poor, not much there at all......very lifeless. not very good, i wonder if it�s infected or something. pretty bland and tasteless.
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottled sample via gregclow (thanks, man!). Gushed when I opened the bottle, which is almost never a good sign. Light amber in colour with out of control carbonation. Aromas of banana, magic marker, black pepper, alcohol, earth, and creme brulee. Lightweight and prickly in the mouth with some suggestions of dried herbs and grasses, more earth, roasted grains, and apple. There�s a bit of a spent hop note on the finish too. There�s a vague Belgian-ness to this beer in terms of its odd fruit and wild character, but not in a good way. I�m 99.9% sure this sucker is infected. I�m not having much luck with these Trafalgar beers. Best before January 2007.
Trafalgar Portside Amber;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;341ml bottle, 5% a/v Somewhat dark for an amber ale, with a large offwhite head. The smell is of fruit, apples and berries almost exclusively with a malt tinge. The taste is just as fruity as the nose with a peppery hint. Very much like the higher alcohol european beers.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Pour on tap at the brewery, clear straw yellow with white head, aroma brought notes of biscuit, bread, some slight cereal into a bit of grain, no hop notes. Taste was similar, some watery grain, cereal, bread into a bit of yeast, finishing sweet.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Draft sample at the winery. Pours a clear gold color with a small, lasting white head. Like DrSilverworm says, there�s definitely an apple- or plum-like fruity sweetness and mild tartness in this, which isn�t right. It�s also got some of the spicy, grassy Saaz character in there, which is good. Also some straw and pale malts. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation. A little off, but not bad. The Saaz hops are grown on their property, which is pretty cool.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;~8oz on tap at the brewery. Mostly clear golden color. Thin off-white head. Decent ropes of lace. Kind of a fruity, mildly metallic, kind of apple-type flavor. Strange for a pilsener. Lighter to medium body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Kind of slick. Moderate sweet taste, light bitter. An OK pils. It�s doable.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;On tap at the brewery. Pale, yellow and clear with a white head. Aroma and flavor is pilsener malts, noble hops, floral, light fruit. Light body with a crisp, clean feel and a refreshing finish.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Originally rated August 2005. Sweet grain malt aroma mixed with 2 day old wet socks. Kind of bready or on the biscuit side. Pale golden in colour. Not much head, nor lace. No carbonation. Flat mouthfeel. The mouth is kind of sweet with some bitterness. Trafalgar�s best tasting beer... so far. Still looking for a good brew from them.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Slightly hazy with a thin lacy head. Nose of pale malt and light biscuits. Taste was light and pale malty with some mild crystal sweetness. No bitterness. A little boring, but ok.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Tap @ brewpub. Slightly hazy, golden appearance with a lively white head. Clean Pils malts and noble hoppy, mild aroma. A touch of fruitiness to the golden lager, lightly floral, mild hoppy flavor. Mild pils aftertaste. Bleh.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;(draft, 9/17/10). Gold color with light cloudiness. Small white head.

Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Tap. Pours clear gold with a small, fizzy white head, short duration with light lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (grainy, meal, cereal), light hops (spicy), and average esters (fruity) with notes of vegetable. Flavor is average malt (grainy, meal, cereal), light hops (spicy), and average esters (fruity) with notes of vegetable. Light body, low warmth and creaminess, medium carbonation with a dry finish.
Trafalgar Harbour Gold;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;On tap at Highway 61. Pours a clear yellow gold with small white head. Mild grainy nose. Taste is lightly bready with some mellow citric hops. Not bad, but there�s not much to this one.
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle fresh from the brewery. Dark brown pour little to no head, nose is musty kinda lemon off nose. Flavor is similar kinda citrusy, bitter off flavor, really odd finish. Not the worst i have had but not something i want to have again.
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle- Overly yeasty nose combines with lemons, sourdough bread, and a weird vegetable essence. Tastes like a yeasty lemon juice with a creamed corn sweetness and a lambic like brett component. Not all that offensive, I just don�t think it was intended. Poured a slightly hazy yellow liquid topped with a huge froth of never ending head. Watery, lemony sweet finish. 650 ml sample size.
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle 650ml Appearance :Clear ruby brown with fine white contrasting top.3+ Nose :Chocolate, roasts with woody accents. Not as clean as some stouts go. 6- Flavour/Palate: Thin base , quiet harsh texture with remote hint of roasted malt. More body, better malt base is the right way to do it. Pretty label is only good for first buy.
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;[536-20070818] Sample @ BeerBistro (Golden Taps, Toronto, ON). Floral yeast aroma with some weird possibly rotting vegetable. Clear, orange amber body with a quick foamy off-white head. Creamy canned corn or mushroom flavour background with a smooth yeast and some alcohol. Medium body. Weird notes to it.
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;2007 Golden Tap Awards. Golden body with a tiny white head. Odd aroma is lightly yeasty and wheaty with a note of canned mushrooms. Similar flavour has more of what is not actually, but is best described as canned mushrooms. Light bitterness, wheaty notes. Average palate. Not unpleasant per se, but kind of bizarre. At least this sample didn�t explode all over the kitchen!
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;500ml Bottle - thanks to gregclow: Finally got around to trying this one, and I wish I hadn�t. Why, oh why, do I continue to entrust my hard-earned dollars to this brewery? Pours 2/3 head, so I waited for the yellow gold colour to emerge before topping it up. Aroma is plenty of lemons, yeast, very faint spicing.. mostly lemon. That still didn�t prepare me or my drinking partners for the lemon sack-slap offered by the drink itself. It�s just putrid, like drinking Realemon from the jar with only hints of spices and a sourness resembling that powder on sour candies. None of us got anywhere close to finishing it. Horrid.
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"Bottle shared with and courtesy of HogTownHarry. Labelled ""White Oak Weissbier."" Weird that the prior ratings mention having no head when they pour it, we poured carefully and got nothing but head! That can�t be good. After a few minutes it�s a pale gold colour, lots of bubbles. Aroma is yeasty along with grain, spices and quite a bit of citrus. Flavour of lemon juice, a little sour even, with some faint spices and yeast and a very dry finish. Light bodied. I�ve had worse but this isn�t very good, we didn�t finish the bomber."
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"Bottle (650ml). Shared with blankboy, courtesy of GregClow. As ""White Oak Weissbier."" Best before December 2006, but WTF ... Extremely pale yellow, clear, with a MASSIVE white frothy head - and I poured carefully. The aroma�s .. not bad, really - dry sharp spice and yeast, apple and a hint of banana, lemon juice around the edges, more dominant near the bottom of the bottle. The taste is weak, sour lemon, think dry spice, sugary fruit - yes, it�s a tad stale, but there�s enough sour lemon in here to preserve it for decades!! Watery, acidic, moderately fizzy mouthfeel, really left my throat raw with the sharpness and bitter/sour lemon. Not horrid - I won�t have it again, though."
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle: Clear golden color with virtually no head. Light and kinda winey, some wheat, very bland. Not horrible, but not really that good either.
Trafalgar Granary Wheat;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"Thank you Sammy for the great company, the polite guest, the meaningful conversation, the fun ""the canadians are flying in to see me braggin rights"" and most importantly for not liking this one as well. I was almost afraid to rate it (and now I don�t even have to go into my I am not liberal enough to get sucked in by the charity bit stuff rant--in fact I am not liberal at all!) If it were a grannysmith apple tree they were saving maybe the whole deal would make sense, but it is not. I was confused by the necessity and hype of this less than marginal piss like poor excuse of a drink."
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle, purchased at the brewery in Oakville. Medium amber, low brief white head. Nice aroma of earthy caramel, a bit nutty. Extremely watery tea-like palate, tannic dryness, peanut-skin bitterness, but nothing to hold things up. This is like a second-run brew, or small beer, off of poor stock. Not an enjoyable mild for me.
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Trade thanks to Brigadier. Served at cellar temperature. Amber pour with a large but quickly dissipating off-white head. Full aroma, spiced cider and malt syrup. Initial flavor similarly impressive, but the main malt flavors are weaker, carbonic, and bordering on the papery. Light bodied, refreshing.
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Sample at Tied House This was my second sample and the first one that I rated. Because the golden ale was not much to write home about I skipped over it. This, on the other hand, was a well crafted mild ale that could be consumed easily all night long. In fact I ended up buying a bottle to take home at the end of the night. Aroma / Appearance - Amber and semi-transparent the body ripples with a light amount of carbonation. Light cedar notes give it a clean and simple presence. It�s not complex but I did not expect it to be. Flavor / Palate - The woody first impression fades quickly. It did not take long to knock off this light 2.9% ABV beer. Very drinkable and sessionable I think I may just have to open my one bottle later this week and revisit a solid beer from a seldom seen style.
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bought at brewers retail store. 650ml bottle 2.8% a/v Pours a nice light orange with a small head. Nose consists of malt and cider. The taste is malt plain and simple. May have been better with more carbonation but wouldnt have been true to what they were trying to reprodce. The mouthfeel is generous with a lingering malt aftertaste.
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Cloudy orange-brown w/ a small, frothy off-white head. Mild notes of caramel, toffee & nuts on the nose. Light, somewhat thin feel. Light, malty flavour of caramel, light chocolate. Finish is mild & slightly dusty.
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Pours a reddish colour, not much in the way of head. Sweet aroma. Flavour is sweet and toffee or caramel like with hints of nut. I enjoyed it, but its not exceptional.
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Best till January 2003 so I guess I better drink it quick!! By far one of the best light beers I have ever had. Sweet taste dark colour. Quickly fading head. Weak body though. However still tasty
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Candy aroma, orange, with white fluffy head. Sweet syrupy flavour, mild nutty after taste, some tongue tingle, but a thin ordinary beer.
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Do you know aroma of cooked corn? That is what this mild ale had .Very small bubbles with average head. My was sweet with some lemon accents. Bad aftertaste, it wasn�t old but tasted like one. Eghhhh.
Trafalgar Red Hill Mild;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;reddish brown colour. head disappears quickly. some melony sweetness seems to want to come out but just doesn't. a little thin. I'd like a bit more malt and a little less carbo.
Trafalgar Abbey Belgian;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Dubbel;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle is at least 8 months old, bottle says best before March 09. Poured a brown color with ruby red highlights when held up to light. No head to speak of. Nose is strong. Lots of spice and dark malts, some hints of yeast. For an older bottle, the smell is excellent. Flavour is sweet, but with plenty of spice present. Some cloves, and maybe a bit of nutmeg or cinnamon. Very sweet, plenty of malts. Some molasses or brown sugar. Not much hops to speak of. Carbonation is low, but fitting. Beer is reasonably creamy, but not thick and oily. Actually a pretty nice beer, I really didn�t have much expectations for this, even when it was fresher.
Trafalgar Abbey Belgian;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Dubbel;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Very strong sweet and fruity nose with some licorice and plenty of roastiness. I have to say the aroma is really not very appealing. Dark brown body topped by a very shy tan head that recedes rapidly and fully. Dark malts counter the sticky sweetness in the flavour but it is still overly sweet. Dark malts in the aftertaste. Watery texture to the body with pretty strong carbonation. Tulip glass. Cellar temperature. Bottle purchased at the LCBO at Lynden Park Mall in Brantford in May-08.
Trafalgar Abbey Belgian;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Dubbel;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;650ml bottle from the LCBO Pours a dark brown with NO head or lacing looks like coca cola The aroma is really nice lots of malt and fruits alas the taste does not live up to the aroma bland and thin malt and a touch spicy
Trafalgar Abbey Belgian;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Dubbel;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;650mL bomber from the LCBO. I would not have bought this if it was not fresh, and I had not had my first positive experience with ANYTHING from this brewery recently. Pours a coca cola colour with no head. Smells like home brewed amber ale of sorts. Not bad, but only with the slightest hint of anything Belgian like in it. Flavour is, decent, not infected, just kind of bland. Decent caramalts, maybe a small hint of spices, almost making it Belgian like. Some dryness in the finish hints at Earthy herbal hops and makes it passable as a Belgian. The alcohol is present but not in a cloying way. It is actually not a bad beer, it is just not really an Abbey Dubbel. At best it is a home brewed Belgian Amber Ale, though I know people who could brew a better one. Quite an accomplishment for Trafalgar.
Trafalgar Abbey Belgian;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Dubbel;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Man that smells good! Malts, raisin, beery and a bit of smoke. Dark brown clear pour with little head. Watery at the start but full at the end. Very malty, some spice, something clove like in the finish. A pretty nice mix but could be sweeter and more consistant but still very nice. Nice to know it�s a local as well. Oh, there is something in the aftertaste that is a little too tart and a bit mediciney. Really wish that wasn�t there, it pretty much kills the beer.
Trafalgar Abbey Belgian;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Dubbel;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Pours a dark-red brown, with no head and the least amount of carbonation I have ever seen. Aroma is a wierd mix of breads, dark fruits and what I can only describe as cooked gelatin for anyone who has ever worked in a lab. Flavour isn�t much better with artifical, chemically tasting sweetness and spices followed by a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is way too thin for the style.
Trafalgar Roggenbier;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Not impressive at all. I was expecting to taste the rye but it was non-existant. Otherwise, it was a decent beer, just nothing to write home about.
Trafalgar Roggenbier;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Sweet candied aroma, amber, big short lived vanilla head. Well balanced malt and bitterness, has a rye flavour. Lot's of carbonation, good tongue tingle. An interesting beer, but it doesn't seem like a German Wheat.
Trafalgar Roggenbier;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Crystal clear light amber looks, at first nice large crown that sized down quick. Unusual aroma of sweet candy and milk / roasted raisins. Med. bitter that switched to earthy falvours.
Trafalgar Roggenbier;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;deep golden colour. doughy aroma. tart, fruity. not bad at all..........
Trafalgar Roggenbier;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Golden orange color. Slightly yeasty, some fruit in the nose. Slightly fruity body, woody, semi-tart palate. Interesting brew, is it supposed to be tart?
Trafalgar Roggenbier;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Has husky rye flavours and some faint spiciness. The label says that this is brewed under contract, but doesn't say for whom. It doesn't taste anything like Thurn und Taxis.
Trafalgar Downrigger Bock;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;650ml bottle. Huge mocha head and a nice deep red-brown colour. Nose of yeast, bread, nuts. A disappointing sour malty taste with some backstage hops. Awful.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle, with a different label design than pictured here. Medium brown body, beige head. Grainy caramel aroma and flavour. Extremely watery, bland, disappointing.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;500 ml bottle from LCBO. Pours a brownish-reddish colour with a small tan head that disappears quickly. I enjoyed this one.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"Smells sweet, and tastes sweet. A little syrupy for my liking, with the slightly ""spoiled"" taste that an overly sweet beer often is accompanied by. Burnt aftertaste is somewhat nice and lasts a moderately long duration. Medium to thin body, not bad if you like it sweet but not really for me. Also, the head was really bubbly, like a soda."
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle from the LCBO. Pours a clear brown with a reddish hue, some nice white head dissipates quickly. Smell is quite weak, I can smell some toasty malt, but not much else. Palate is horrendous, really thin body, not much carbonation and nearly no aftertaste. Taste is also quite weak, get some sweetness from the malt, with a tiny bit of bitterness lingering around, but no real complexity to this one. This isn�t aggressively bad, just boring.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle: Poured a clear light amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of unrefined grain and weird vegetable aroma is really not pleasant. Taste is also a spectacular mess between some unrefined grain and weird cereal notes with are top-off by some rotten vegetables. This one ended up in the drain quiet fast � can�t believe the LCBO is still willing to distribute this crap.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Originally rated June 2005. I still have to find a Trafalgar brew that I like. This one starts badly, as it seems to be outdated. It pours an amber-red colour with a bubbly tanned head. Foamy lacing is not too bad. Slight caramel malt aroma. The taste is that sour outdated mouth... that I hate so much with brews that just don�t sell. The rest of the real taste is the regular Trafalgar ale taste. Nothing special, very boring actually. Can�t wait to finish all of their brews and never go back to them.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;my version is 5% and called trafalgar irish ale. Its brown kinda and red. Smells like lemon flaved dish soap. Taste like heavy bodied watery lemon and an after taste of lime. Doubt this is how the style is meant to taste but dunno. its not bad but care less for another. cheer�s.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Well then! Shipped up from down south, well damn these beers ain�t cheap.. but nonetheless I give �em a try, tryin� to see if they��re worth the effort to ship up by air to the high (yeah, high) arctic. Poured at 6.6c, this one has very little head and a brown-copper body. The aroma is faint malts. Flavour is a forgettable bunch of malt and barley, smooth but not complex at all. Drinkable for sure, but a little too easy. It needs more.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Aroma: chocolate, malt, hints of ginger, but not much aroma. Apperance: Tiny head, tons of carbonation, thick opaque brown. Palate: watery, flat, thin bodied. Bleh. Taste: slightly bitter, very sweet, but not complex at all. Not a good beer, but could be worse.
Trafalgar Celtic Pure Irish Ale;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;very inconsistent! When they get it right, it�s brilliant, but probably half the bottles I buy have vinegar flavors. recommended on tap at the brewery only!
Pony Express Blizzard Ale;Olathe, Kansas, United States;Flavored - Other;Flying Monkey Brewing;Aroma is darkly fruity and malty. Very nice somewhat murky garnet coloration. Initial flavor is of the spices mingling with the fruity malt flavors, which are somewhat intense, and then some fruity/hoppy aftertastes, with the spices coming into it again at the tail end of the beer. This isn't a Winter Warmer, per se, though, the overall mouthfeel and probably alcohol content don't indicate it, anyway. Just a spiced dark red ale. I like this beer.
Brewers Art House Pale Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours a darker orange color with a slight pear and hop aroma.

New England Holiday Ale;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Other;New England Brewing Co.;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. 12/10/03: I had this on draught at their brewpub and it was a great beer. Nice and spicy with a lot of chocolate malt and a lot of fruity aromas. I wish I could find it in the bottle.
New England Holiday Ale;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Other;New England Brewing Co.;I last enjoyed this in the late 1990�s. Nice blend of spices, not too strong. My family enjoyed this every winter, we miss it greatly.
New England Holiday Ale;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Other;New England Brewing Co.;I found a six of this hiding in my grandmothers sellar, some were obviously soured but the couple that seemed good overly spiced and lacking any sort of hop.
New England Holiday Ale;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Flavored - Other;New England Brewing Co.;I was lucky enough to find a sixer of this on a weekend beer hunt. It was still good, after however many years it''s been sitting there, and on par with Anchor''s christmas ale, or any of those. Flavors are delicately and subtly represented, mixing with the natural herbal hoppiness and earthy malts. Truly a great christmas ale.

Lake Louie Tommys Porter;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Pours a deep brown with a full tan head. The aroma consists of roasted malts, caramel, chocolate and cocoa, with the caramel and cocoa standing out most. There is some moderate bitterness in the taste and isn't all that sweet. Its much more roasted than the nose was, while the caramel impression remains potent. Chocolate, coffee, nuts, and mild smoke serve as undertones. Long, bitter coffee aftertaste. Medium in body, creamy in texture, and with flat carbonation. I found this one to be very easy to drink. Very enjoyable.
Lake Louie Tommys Porter;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Dark, toasted malts, chocolate, sweet coffee.

Aroma has caramel and fruit and molasses-y old socks. Taste is of sweet caramel, some molasses, a bit of brown sugar and light earth. Medium bodied. Finishes sweet and earthy.

Lake Louie Tommys Porter;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Crushed with Jakebra Pours a dark brown with reddish hues when held up to light. The head is medium sized and leaves some lacing on the glass. Man, the aroma is really sweet... lots of molasses & raisin. It�s got some roastiness, but geeze it�s really raisiny. The flavor is tart fruit, like to the point of sour. It�s nutty & has some coffee to it, it�s got plenty of raisin, but man this comes across more as a sour. It�s not bad, it just took me totally off guard. What a strange beer.
Lake Louie Tommys Porter;Arena, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Lake Louie Brewing (Wisconsin Brewing Company);Pours a nice mahogany. Medium creamy khaki head, little lasting with dome lace.

Tom Wood's Jolly Ploughman;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);Bottle. (Brief tasting notes and rating from old records) - Nice, strong, dark roast, nutty malt taste with bitter malty finish. Very drinkable. (Backlog)
Tom Wood's Jolly Ploughman;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);Brown 500ml bottle, best before 28 Dec 2010, drank 16 May 2010, poured into two Palm (Belgian) glasses. Bright, clear, dark amber body with a big bubbled tan head on top. Malts dominate the smell, with hints of dark chocolate notes as it warms. Dry, very dry for a Brown Ale, ideal with cheese I�d imagine (think Ploughmans Lunch). There is a hop bitterness that forces its way through the malts, giving the beer a well rounded feel. The chocolate from the aroma also appears latterly in the taste. I like beers from this brewery, this one doesn�t stand out, but is well worth trying if you ever see it.
Tom Wood's Jolly Ploughman;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);First tasted this in the Three Judges, Glasgow in December 1995. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear dark amber in colour with a thick white head. Slight prickle of roast malt in the short aroma. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts gives a moist fruit loaf flavour with molasses and dates present. Slight note of bitter hop resins in the slightly dry aftertaste. Robust finish is fiery and full of malt with sweet golden syrup notes evident. An excellent ESB and well recommended.

Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;1st beer they poured me on tap at the Brewery. I guess they are bringing this back. I�ve got Hawaiin Gold in my notes. Golden in color with thin head. Very light bodied. Little malt and hops.
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;Bottle poured a hazy gold with a minimal white head. Aromas of bread, carmel and oxidation. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of carmel, bread and a hint of citrus with a crisp malty finish.
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle, thanks to DarkElf for slipping me this one. Pours golden amber with little to no head. Aroma is fruity, floral and herbal with hints of orange and light spice. Flavor is an interesting combination of toasty malts with a bit of slightly souring fruit, and a light floral hoppiness. Thin body and very little carbonation. This would be a mindless, sitting by the beach beer - perfect for hawaii I guess.
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Purchased by my buddy Norm in Hawaii) At least with this beer, you know exactly what you�re getting as soon as the beer is poured. First impression: loads of bread, sweet corn and grain dominate the nose and flavor. And even after further sips and study, that�s really about all there is to this beer. Body is light-medium and carbonation is fine. Medium straw in color with a bit of haziness. Whitish head pours to about an inch in height, slowly fading to a thin layer but never becoming filmy or wispy. A few large patches of lace remain on the glass. Not that great, but frankly, I�ve tasted much worse.
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;"spicey and lemony nose with some yeast; fairly bland and sweet; this won�t be missed"
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;Lager aroma with an off note. Hazy yellow with an average sized white head. Decent lace. Very heavy visible carbonation. Blah lager flavor with some off notes. Good thing they are replacing this brew. The new Humpback Blue is much better and not because it is so great. This brew just doesn�t have many redeeming qualities.
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;"No clue how old this is as the label says ""best if consumed before"" and then doesn�t give a date. Pours golden with a thin white head. Malty aroma. Flavor is lightly malty with a bit of hops. Finishes semi dry. Refreshing. Decent brew while out on the beach."
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;Unbelievable. I tried to give Mehana another chance, and i bought a single beer at the local ABC store. The label read �Best if consumed by Jan...Dec (ya ready for this?) 97 98 99� Now either they are using old labels, or i have really bad luck. Second beer in one weekend, that i had by the company that was Way out of date!
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;Relatively still medium yellow beer. Excellent balanced malty beer, active on the tongue with just a hint of a citric bite at the end. Excellent.
Mehana Beer;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;"Bought this not knowing its style, as it's not designated on the box or bottle. Figured it to be a light lager, but I wanted to try it anyway. Have to say, I was pleasantly surprised after the first sip... Light golden with a sudzy, lasting head. Chewy sweetness up front. Surprisingly rich-bodied; chalky almost. Nicely carbonated. Pleasant notes of tartness, sourness, honey, grains, and zingy, spicy hops. Nicely balanced. Dryish, clean finish with enjoyable, though subtle, flavors in the aftertaste. A good example of a light and mild beer with quite a bit of flavor."

La Cervoise des Ancetres (Engel Brauerei);Schw�bisch Gm�nd, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Engel Brauerei;Very nice bottle made out of stone. The beer itself is nothing sort of special except for its fruity and salty aroma which reminds me a little bit of cider with salt. Quite expensive beer for its value though.

Aroma is VERY mellow with maybe a hint of graininess and vegetal character. Flavour has gentle grains with very light grassiness. No real finish to speak of.

Big Rock Alberta Genuine Draft;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;I bought a 24 of this last night. Loses its head after 60 seconds after which it tastes pretty horrid. Like no draft beer I've ever downed. I'll try again tonight because it wasn't fully chilled.

Mild, sweet flavour of bready malt, corn, vegetal, honey and grass in a dry finish. Light body with a thin, watery texture and soft carbonation. Not horrible, but not great either.

Skagit River Dutch Girl Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Draft at Fiddler�s Inn. Clear light amber pour. Some nutty malt and a big of hoppy crispness on the close, slightly earthy, lots of taste -- I�m just amazed to discover we�re looking at 3.3 ABV. Water down by 3% and this baby would be legal in Utah! I would have called it at 5% at least. Props to Skagit for this one.
Skagit River Dutch Girl Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Skagit River Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewpub in Mt Vernon, Washington. Pours a semi-clear golden amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that leaves behind some spotty lacing and an average sized white ring. Aroma of light caramel malt, citrus zest, and a touch of grassy hops. Taste is medium bodied, with flavors of light apple, caramel and more grassy hops. Finish is semi-dry with a lingering bitterness that almost could put this into an American Pale Ale category. Nicely hopped premium lager overall.
Skagit River Dutch Girl Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Skagit River Brewing Co.;On tap at Skagit River in Mt. Vernon, WA--Poured a pale clear straw golden hue with a frothy thick white head. Clean, grainy, mildly citrus nose. Very drinkable, great mouth feel, hop zest and clean, non-pervasive finish.
Skagit River Dutch Girl Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Skagit River Brewing Co.;22 oz. bomber. Shiny, clear gold in color. Nice, frothy head settles quickly but keeps a bubbly cap throughout. Not much there on the nose, maybe just a hint of grain. It has a respectable hop bite, and a smooth mix of grains and citrus zest. It is really drinkable, and of course, ultimately sessionable. Quite a surprise in this bottle.
Skagit River Dutch Girl Lager;Mount Vernon, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Skagit River Brewing Co.;Pours gold with lots of little bubbles rising to the top-type effervescence.

Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle b/b 15/06/07. Pale straw coloured, thin milky head.Faint dry hoppy but dominant yeast aroma. Relatively non-descript with a brief wheat finish. Nice quaffer but no classic. No sign of any orange/coriander...???
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Smells and looks nice but again (similar to a few Mac�s beers) too much in the way of orange and coriander. I just don�t understand why you�d do that to a witbier. I drank one and gave the other five away (my flatmates love me).
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Looks like a peroxide blonde. Citrus fruity aromas, like orange crush cordial, which I quite like. Couldn�t see myself drinking more than 1 of these in a sitting though.
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Witbier - Never really liked the style anyway, but this, this was a shambles. I was a little rough on the pour, just eager to get this little gem into the glass and down the gullet I guess!!!!. Ended with an inch thick, snow-white head that retained well and impressively frosted the sides of the tulip. The body of beer a not so bright (chill haze perhaps!) lemony yellow. Simple club lemon soda aroma with a touch of fresh squeezed lime and good ol� SWEATY SOCK. Dry and powdery on the palate at first. Quite zingy, lightly sour and favouring lemon fizz-whizz and potato starch. Watery thin in body and quite stretched for any other character aside from a soapy, detergent-like feel and flavour that develops like a plague. Becomes flabby and lifeless by the finish, by which I was glad it was over. Quite honestly boring and chemical to drink. Not good at all. (33cL, 10/11/06, Morley Liquor Merchants)
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A poor Kiwi filtered witbier. As others have observed, this tastes like a spiced lager shandy, with few of the qualities of a good wit. It�s a clear watery gold with a 1cm cap of foam. The aroma is all lime cordial and lemonade - very citric. But in the mouth this really disappoints. It�s a discordant mix of soda water, lemon juice, coriander and lager shandy. Rounded palate, moderate carbonation. The orange peel is too intrusive, giving this a soft drink-like acidity. Just doesn�t come together. (330ml bottle from Clovelly Vintage Cellars)
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);On tap at Warners in Christchurch. Thought I�d be getting a blone wheat beer when I asked for this, but nup, it wasn�t. Puzzling aroma of fruit and enjoyable beer, but the label bothered me. Blonde? No way.
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Draught at The Honest Lawyer, Nelson. Clear pale golden, no head. Obvious orange aroma. Medium bodied with clean, rounded mouthfeel. The body is unusually beefy for a witbier and the coriander flavour is ramped up as well. Still it�s a more than decent effort.
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Some urinal cake in the aroma. Watery, with a thin zesty lemon character. Some subtle coriander character. Not much going on it has to be said, tasted like lemonade or something.
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Very citrussy, with a little wet-dog element too. Palate is dominated by orange and lemon flavours, which early on I quite liked as it was 32 degrees outside. But as I got through it, the citrus flavour became a little too much, and seemed artificial in a way. Certainly has no characteristics to suggest it is a wheat beer-- no estery quality, no wheatiness in the palate, no banana/bubblegum notes-- it wasn�t even the least bit hazy. I feel a little cheated by this beer, but I am willing to cut it some slack because I truly did enjoy it in the hot Perth sunshine.
Mac's Blonde Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Aroma: zesty with some floral hop. Appearance: very pale gold yellow with a big head and some lacing. Flavour: sweet florally and citrus. Palate: finishes with a bit of banana and drinks clean.
Free State Weisshammer Wheat Bock;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Free State Brewing Company;Spicy, fruity aroma. Very nice red-golden color, unfiltered. The first thing I noticed about this beer was the fruity, flowery, malty flavors, followed closely by what I could swear was coriander...I've never had coriander in a wheat bock beer, but as it warmed, it really mingled nicely with the other flavors present, including a nice yeasty flavor towards the end. Very interesting, and quite tasty.

Arcadia Loch Down;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Arcadia Brewing Company;Pours clear mahogany with a thick and fairly persistent buff head. Fair aroma features toasted malt, caramel and subtle dark fruit notes. Not strong, but invites a taste. Sweet flavor yields dark fruit, toasted malt, caramel, resiny hops - and is that a snipped of chocolate? Texture offers firm, smooth body if not a lot of fizz. Take a loch at this one.
Arcadia Loch Down;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Arcadia Brewing Company;Really like this beer and don't understand the negative ratings. Tastes like a pleasant hybird of a sour and a scotch ale.

Rock Creek All-American Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Chesapeake Bay Brewing (formerly Rock Creek);I didn''t really go for this American Ale. It reminded me quite a bit of Erie Railbender, but unfortanantely did not have the high alcohol content. I would try it again in a sampler, but wouldn''t waste my money on a whole case.

Chesapeake Bay Brewing Premium Pilsner;La Plata, Maryland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Chesapeake Bay Brewing Company;"the first thing that came to my mind when pouring this beer was ""whoa, this is way too dark to be a pilsner. Amber in color, took a very hard pour to get even little head, some stick power, malt aroam with subtle hints of fresh green apples detected. No Czeck hops detected, which is a must for me. Not a bad beer at all, just a little off base however to qualify as a true pilsner. Thanks Gusler"
Chesapeake Bay Brewing Premium Pilsner;La Plata, Maryland, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Chesapeake Bay Brewing Company;"Dark looking for a pils; Zero head; citrus and straw in the nose. Rounder in the mouth then most pils. Maltier too. Very unpilsner like."

Trinity Rhode Island Ram Light Lager;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trinity Brewhouse;Yellow, Light white lace. Tart and metallic, not much else. Obviously geared towards the URI party crowd.
Trinity Prov Bruin Pilsner;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Trinity Brewhouse;Tap - Dry grassy (erby) scent. Bitter, not as much as IPA, but noticeable.

Trinity Peoples Porter;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Porter;Trinity Brewhouse;"Pours a dark, somewhat translucent dark mahogany with a thin light tan head. Rich aroma has notes of roast malt, powdery semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and molasses. Flavor echoes the roast malt and chocolate of the aroma and has molasses, caramel and even woody hop notes.

Trinity Peoples Porter;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Porter;Trinity Brewhouse;On tap at the brewpub. Nice toasty aroma. Wow, this has a lot of flavor for such a low gravity flavor. I think the house style for dark beers is a bit charred and umami-heavy for me. It�s a nip sweet, but there�s a lot of deliciousness going on. Wonderful complexity for a session beer.
Trinity Peoples Porter;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Porter;Trinity Brewhouse;Samples in late 06 - Dark brown color with a decent head for a pint glass. Smells and tastes malty, roasty coffee and chocolate, sweet, and a roasty finish. Thin feel, but not bad.

Trinity Rhode Island IPA (-2017);Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Trinity Brewhouse;New England Sample #3: Staying with my sister-in-law who's been living here for 10 years (first visit)...so figure I'd try something from her hometown. This is a good attempt of an IPA, just lacking a bit on flavor. Balance is just ok, malt and hops slightly on the weaker side, but still drinkable and an overall decent brew. Just so many more better ones out there. Appearance is cloudy and medium orange. This might be a closer example af an older IPA before all these microbrewgeeks started going buck with the hoppier/maltier variations?
Trinity Rhode Island IPA (-2017);Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Trinity Brewhouse;Draft sample at the source. The beer is a hazed copper with a white head of foam.

Trinity Rhode Island IPA (-2017);Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Trinity Brewhouse;12 oz bottle which is admittedly 3-months old (which is older than I�d like for an IPA review.) Light, hazy amber-orange with an inch of frothy sea-foam head which decays at a moderate rate. Aroma is a bit of caramel, moss, and hint of evergreen. Medium body with medium-coarse carbonation, slight burn. Flavor is a fair amount of lingering somewhat astringent bitterness. A bit of caramel and butterscotch. Slightly hot on the exhale. A bad IPA. I likely won�t finish it.

Trinity Rhode Island IPA (-2017);Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Trinity Brewhouse;Sampled at the brewery. Golden with some browner hues. A small layer of foam. I taste tropical fruit first and then caramel. Bitter citrus after that. Almost classic west coast with tropical and citrus fruit flavors. Some tangerine is noted later. That fruit makes this a fine beer.

Aroma is roasted grain, cocoa powder and light Godiva chocolate. The flavor follows with a nice level of darker chocolate, ashy roasted malt, mild tones of dark fruit( raisins, plums). The flavor is pretty nice but the body lacks the fullness that I want in the style. Slightly above average.
Trinity Russian Imperial Stout;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Imperial;Trinity Brewhouse;Nitro tap. Black with a light-brown, ultra fine head that lingers around awhile, but once it�s gone it cannot be reinvigorated by any means. Aroma/flavor are toast, light coffee, some chocolate, touch of soy sauce and pine bitterness. Body is medium with a relatively restrained carbonation, oily-syrupy. Overall, this gives the impression of being a slightly dry imperial stout. I wish it had a fuller flavor, in keeping with the style.

RCH Ale Mary;Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Strong Ale - English;RCH;Big beefy head and pours easily. Initial great promise before it hits the tongue with a weird incongruous cocktail of hot spices which dominate everything. Undrinkable drain pour.
RCH Ale Mary;Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Strong Ale - English;RCH;"Nice pour. Plenty of foam sitting on a medium gold brew. The foam ain�t going anywhere soon but what�s shrinking leaves lacing behind. The smell is festive; spicy with some cinnamon, a bit of clove, and fruity ..cherry like flavour when I swish the beer in my mouth, dark fruit when I don�t swish.

RCH Ale Mary;Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, England;Strong Ale - English;RCH;Pours a red with a full and frothy white head. Pleasing aroma consists of apple, ginger, cinnamon, lemon, and orange. The fruits and ginger are the dominant qualities in this aspect. Taste is big on spice. Lots of ginger, along with cinnamon and nutmeg are on top. The fruitiness is still readily apparent, but serve more as undertones. Spicy cinnamon aftertaste is rather short. Dry finish. Medium bodied with some fizzy carbonation in the mouthful. Lots of lacing remains. I thought this was a good beer. While I�m usually not the biggest fan of this style, this one is more different than others and there is plenty here to enjoy.

Newport Storm 01;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Thanks Jason for sharing this! Pours to a caramel colored body with no head. Aromas of apple brandy with caramel and sherry. Perhaps some menthol and mint in this? Flavor of apple brandy and caramel with a subtle mint. Palate is medium bodied and sweet. Caramelized. Perhaps too old?
Newport Storm 01;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;750mL bottle. Poured medium-deep amber with a dusting of beige head. The aroma picked up sour cherry dust, oak, and vinous notes, with warm, well-aged bready backing.. a touch of apple skin too.. very broken down, but there were some solid elements. The flavor found tangy vinous notes, cherry, and oak throughout, with molasses, vanilla, and lesser chocolate support.. lightly-sour and oxidized.. long, peppery finish. Medium-plus bodied, slick, and a bit too sour on the palate.. this was probably a lot better 9 or 10 years ago.
Newport Storm 01;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Muddy deep copper pour w/ tons of sediment and a whispy white head. Green apple skins booze and a touch of mint in the aroma. Full well coated palate a touch chewy. Tastes of green apple skins, brandy, brown sugar, butter, and a touch of sour. Still a nice drink, but past its prime at this point.
Newport Storm 01;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Philly RBSG June 2011. Cloudy copper with a small off white head.

Newport Storm 01;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;"750mL Bottle poured at the brewery tasting room for The ""Odd"" Years Vertical Tasting. Strong vanilla and light oxidation nose. Complex, and thankfully, not all that oxidized. It hasn�t held up as well as �00, but it�s doing pretty well. Fruity and strong. A nice enjoyable rich balance of malt and vanilla. Very good, but not epic. Slightly past peak, but with a notable amount of carbonation! I�m impressed at the way vanilla behaves at this age."
Newport Storm 01;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;(750ml bottle) Pours a mahogany body with a spare beige head. Aroma of leather, oxidation, port, caramel, and prunes. Flavor of alcohol, caramel, vinous, fruit, herbs, and cardboard. Hot.

Newport Storm 01;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Newport Craft Brewing;Pouring at the grand tasting at RBSG in Philly. Pours a clear amber, looks a little like cognac. Big oxidization, rusty malt. Warm raisins and prunes, oxidized like crazy. Lots of oxidization, malty and smooth. Oxidized malt, light booze on the finish. Apart from the ticker/collector mentality, I�m not entirely sure why I did this. I knew going into (after having an 07 a few months back) that these were all probably going to be rather rough, and that I�d be obliged to go from 01-06 once I started, but I had it anyway, and so it began. Made it through 01, 02, and 03, had a couple different ones, then 04. Then it would be about 20 other good beers before I could will myself back to finish the set. Still, thanks to whomever it was that brought these, as it was an interesting experience.

Tonnerre De Brest Cuv�e Nuit;Brest, France;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Tonnerre De Brest;Bottle - sampled at the RBESP 2005 Citric and herbal aroma. Cloudy brown colour creamy brown head. Herbal and nutty flavors dominate. Wasnt really impressed by this one.
Tonnerre De Brest Cuv�e Nuit;Brest, France;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Tonnerre De Brest;Bottle at RBESG grand tasting, August 2005. Chestnut colour. Big on toffee and caramel. Low on hops. Not really my sort of beer. There�s some plummy fruit and some spices in the flavour but its a bit sweet for me. Could do with more bite.
Tonnerre De Brest Cuv�e Nuit;Brest, France;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Tonnerre De Brest;Sampled at RBESG 2005. Dark brown colour. Nice aroma of kandis and roasted malt. A sweet and some unpleasent flavour of chocolate and dried fruit. Some complexity but still unpleasent.
Tonnerre De Brest Cuv�e Nuit;Brest, France;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Tonnerre De Brest;A hazy brown beer with a disappearing beige head. The aroma is sweet with notes of wood and caramel, while the flavor is sweet and again with notes of caramel, but this time combined with notes of vitaminpills - maybe it is the spice combination, that gives me this association - but it is not really my thing.
Tonnerre De Brest Cuv�e Nuit;Brest, France;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Tonnerre De Brest;Bottle. Quite a yeasty dark Belgian strong. Licorice, and yeast, touches of caramel. Lightly fizzy, more of a soft carbonation on the tongue. Chocolate. Some alcohol showing in the finish.
Tonnerre De Brest Cuv�e Nuit;Brest, France;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Tonnerre De Brest;(Bottle 75 cl) Dark, clear chestnut brown with a handsome, tall beige head. Lots of roasted malt, sweetness and notes of licorice. Very soft and pleasant. 120805
Tonnerre De Brest Cuv�e Nuit;Brest, France;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Tonnerre De Brest;(On bottle at RBESG 2005)dark oaky colour. Citric liquorice aroma, a bit like coughsirup. A tad too big on the carbonation, taste is just of more coughsirup and cardemomme, maybe mint? Quite warm finish.

Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);A must have beer if you are visiting Tasmania! Easy drinking beer perfect for nights out and bbq�s
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Tap (Sth Arm RSL). Sweet and plain but clean enough. Slightly earthy. Very low bitterness. Basic gulping lager - by no means the worst Australian example.
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);As a Hobartian this is my local beer and thank god it�s so damn tasty. Easy to drink with a simple but enjoyable flavour profile
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Sample at Cacade. Grainy and slightly bitter. Overall a pretty basic lager.
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);375ml can into glass. From a St Helens bottlo. Nose of malt, sourness, and a bit of funkiness. Golden amber beer with frothy white head. Very low carbonation. Some lacing. Oily texture. Tastes like cooked vegetables followed by castor sugar sweetness and tin. Then the veggies come back only this time they bring some lemon sherbets with them. Retro-weird.
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);"Draught at Cascade Brewery, Hobart. Poured a crystal clear golden amber with a one-finger bright white dense foamy head that retained very well and laced well. Carbonation moderate to high, lively and coarse. Aroma subtly of pale malts; no obvious hops. Taste of pale malt and slight sweetness; no real bitterness. Light body. Crisp and smooth while cold with a slightly sweet finish. Slightly sweeter than the Cascade Lager but still a macro-brewed beer."
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Staple of any full-blooded southern Tasmanian. In a country where every state claims their own signature draught is the backbone to society, this one goes alright, so much that I could be blindfolded and pick it like a dirty nose. Good, honest easy drinking beer.
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Draught at Cascade Visitor centre. Clean, crisp beer with a decent malt backbone and a touch of bitterness. Easy drinking.
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);4.7%ABV. Pale Lager. Tapped out a gold. 6�SRM. Faint beery nose. Clean. Fresh fruit aroma. Full body. Heavier mouthfeel. Sudsy. Pleasant toast, nuts, caramel. Rounder, softly beery sour palate. Toffee sweet malt finish. Brief bitter hops. Will go on the list for sentimental reasons. It�s just a good working stiff�s dive bar draught. It�s accessible quality, something progressive gentrification of all the workaday staples is making sure you see less and less of. Goes on Favorites List!
Cascade Draught;Hobart, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cascade Brewery (AB InBev);Lovely little drop, From my last recollection of having the pleasure (6 months ago) Found the aroma to be extremely pleasing especially beside a nice steak which enhanced the flavor more. Tasmanian s are lucky that they have such beautiful place to live which is complimented with some good beers. I know a lot of people prefer Micro Brewers, for me personally though I do also, yet I can not drink more than 2-3 at a time, if I want to have a good night then I will stick with something like this which is lighter on the palate and on pouring into a glass gives a nice crispy golden look with a perfect head
Il Vicino Wet Mountain India Pale Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);On tap at Il Vicino. Pours a nice orangish copper with a finger of foam and aromas of classic American IPA... a bit of lemon and resin. Flavor is similar to nose. Clean and classic old school IPA.
Il Vicino Wet Mountain India Pale Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);32oz crowler thanks to Elise. Pretty legit IPA. Malty and thick, this is no dextrose one-dimensional ride the fresh hops IPA. Thick caramel amber-brown body. Foamy, steady, glass-rimming head. Luscious malt depth. Juicy hop tones. Deeper than most IPAs malt wise, almost has an amber malt feel. Classic, solid US IPA.
Il Vicino Wet Mountain India Pale Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);A very good IPA. Smooth, refreshing, and hoppy. Light alcohol aftertaste. very drinkable.

Il Vicino Wet Mountain India Pale Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Sampled from the tap at the Canteen. Pours a clear amber with a creamy tan head that lasts throught the beer and laces. Aroma has lots of grass with a hint of resin and a bread backbone. Flavor has has more of a bitter citrus and grass combination backed by sweet grains.
Il Vicino Wet Mountain India Pale Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Pours copper color, nice white head with good lacing. Aroma is citrus, more mild than typical west coast. Flavor is malt forward, not too bitter. Very good IPA.
Il Vicino Wet Mountain India Pale Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);12 oz bottled in Nov. from Tipsy�s. Orange/amber and pretty clear with a sticky white head. Aroma of bitter hops (pine, floral, herbal), and rich malts (bread, caramel, toffee). Bitter, linerging flavor, with an average body. A little musty, not too fresh.
Il Vicino Wet Mountain India Pale Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Good session IPA from the standpoint of being a moderately hopped IPA. Leans to the malty side with a not so dry finish. Enjoyable enough to order again.
Il Vicino Wet Mountain India Pale Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;IPA;Canteen Brewhouse (was Il Vicino Pizzeria and Brewery);Pours a copper ale color, quite unexpected for a Western IPA which are usually apricot-orange, hoppy nose but equally malty on the nose, nice malt/hop balance on the palate, hoppy, malty finish. Reminds me more of an East Coast style, than the grapefruit/piney West Coast style.
Biertje Aap;Nederhorst Den Berg, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij de Horste;not as overwhelming as one expects with this gravity........................
PC Ultimate Dry Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Thanks mmmIPA for this little gem of mediocrity. Pours a clear golden with a moderate white head. Sweet apple-kissed pale malt aroma. The flavour is much the same with corny sweet pale malt with almost no bitterness. Too sweet and one-dimensional.
PC Ultimate Dry Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Rate there with water, but very harsh on the throat. Dosent even rate well in the cheap beer catergory.
PC Ultimate Dry Ice;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Waterloo Brewing Company;Mild skunk and somewhat catty with sweet grainy and corn-like DMS in the nose. Clear yellow-gold with thin white head that diminishes rapidly to ring. Mild bitterness with sweet, grainy and vegetal flavour. Moderate carbonation with medium-light body and an unpleasant slick texture that coats the mouth and sticks in the throat. Bottle (Provigo - Feb. 2005).
Three Needs American IPA;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Only retired because of the brewpub not actually brewing their own beer anymore, thanks to Queen City for keeping their beers going, lol, me, thanks for the tick. Poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy looking ""forward"" thinking burnt orange collar-ed flow. Yielded a finger�s worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. The smell had some grassy sweet to bitter malts flowing on into some faded hops. The flavor takes the previously mentioned aromas to combine and rides it all on into the aftertaste (malty) with a slick (not oily) finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation rides underneath, sly, moveable. Good. Overall, decent AIPA, almost EIPA, but yeah, I can see it as an AIPA, do-able and could have again, I think. Thanks Doug."
Three Needs American IPA;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Tap at Vermont Brewer�s Fest 2009. Pale amber with a light woody aroma with a kiss of citrus. Light pale malt and a touch of straw. Hops are a little bit subtle. Not all that punchy or interesting. Meh.
Three Needs American IPA;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;on tap at the brewpub. lightly hazy light orange in color with a small off white head. Aroma of musty, dirty grain, almost no hops at all- also smells a bit off- like dirty lines or the beer is starting to become contaminated. Taste is lightly hoppy, very dry, bitter with a winey- light sour taste. Either this batch was becoming contaminated or the draft line was in very poor shape. Seems like this brewer doesn�t have much brewing knowledge or just doesn�t care.
Three Needs American IPA;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;WHisp of a head on a bit of orange colour. Neutral aroma, unexpected for an IPA. Very dry, though there is hop there. Overcarbonated. Somewhat drinkable, to get some citrus hops.
Three Needs American IPA;Burlington, Vermont, United States;IPA;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Nothing particularly wrong with this brewpub IPA, delivered on tap in the tiny smoky bar of Burlington's ""hippest"" watering hole; but nothing particularly special either. Hard to judge the nose in such a smoky atmosphere, but expected citrus notes and hoppiness are certainly there. Could use more oomph, I guess. Very clean finish."
Nodding Head Dingle Dew;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - English;Nodding Head Brewery;Its almost embarassing to say the name, but one taste and that all goes away. Superb creamy head, from nitrogen system, leaves some nice lacing. Very light in body and taste, some fruits, and nuts, I almost want to say butterscotch. Very pleasant taste, not at all unpleasant, but not a whole lot of depth in its flavor.
Nodding Head Dingle Dew;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - English;Nodding Head Brewery;Lush creamy white head, mild lacing, atop an amber/copper body. Little if any aroma seeps through the heavy head, while the flavor offers little reason to think there is much aroma anyway. Mildly fruity flavor includes hints of pear, bubblegum, almond, barley, yeast, and hay, combining to create a taste vaguely reminiscent of marzepan. Finishes quick and easy with very little bitterness, a characteristic that coincides with this beer's overall weak nature.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;Draft at Bru Craft. This brew making an appearance in Dec 2016 after a long absence. Clear dark brown amber pour with soft off-white foam. Few splashes of lace. Big chewy caramel malts with a glossy edge. Chocolate liquorice. Clove. Allspice. Nutmeg. Vanillin. Shoe polish. Black cherry. Plum pudding. Not my favorite style but this one is better than most.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;"Reddish brown with burgundy hilites; aroma is very sweet malty and notes of tart fruit notes cherry?cranberry?; Flava is sweet upfront with notes of plum pudding, cherry and sassafrass but also dry and roasty notes near finish; feels light per style little fizz; finishes semi sweet and roasty with tangy fruitiness at the end"
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;Draft. Deep ruby color, bright white head. Aroma of caramel and spice. Taste is very sweet and heavily spiced.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;Loved this one. Had it with my daughter on a Christmas weekend. Nice light aroma of vanilla and some spices from a dark brown pour with a small head. The flavor was woody with a bit of vanilla, some caramel, and a lot of malt. An excellent finish with the vanilla washing away years of dieting and weight watching. I began to see bowls of ice cream dancing before my eyes.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;Draft. Pours brown with a thin head. Light malty aroma with vanilla and a hint of spice. The flavor has a solid dried fruity sweetness, vanilla, chestnut and cinnamon. A pretty solid winter seasonal.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;Dark ruby pour. Cinnamon bubblegum figs and plumbs. Coating in the mouth. Spicy with a sweet balance. very nice.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;Pours a deep amber color into the lager glass. Almost no head and minimal lacing. Scents of spice, ginger, cinnamon and brown sugar. Very sweet, syrupy taste and malty flavors. Sticky and coating mouthfeel. A nice winter warmer.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;This is a Liquid ginger snap with whipped cream and a cherry on top. Sweet, smooth and flat. Mouthfeel is thin, but the spices leave the tongue coated. There seem to be some dark fruits in the mash that add make this feel more ripe. Seemingly low ABV.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;Reddish color with light white head. Very sweet aroma with a spicy taste to match - kind of reminds me of Egg nog. Only had a small sample, so I�ll have to try another next year. Overall, pretty good holiday beer.
Nodding Head Sled Wrecker;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Nodding Head Brewery;Aftertaste of cinnamon-caramelized sugar. Sweet with banana-estery yeast. Thin mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Kinda blah. dryish spices on the finish.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Dark amber, medium bodied and pretty flat. Aroma of alcohol, flavor is sweetish and the long finish not so pleasant.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Bittle at Chisinau central market. Clear pale yellow color, medium white head. Aroms of straw and paper. Taste is flat and bitter.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Hazy yellow with a white head. Big vegetal aroma. Taste is syrupy sugar sweet malt with some light hops.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Tasted from bottle into pint glass. Poured a clear, light amber color with weak white foam which immediately dissipated, no lace. Unpleasant aromas of adjunct sugars, moldy bread, alcohol. Cloying adjunct sweetness, oxidation, no trace of hops. Low carbonation. Medium body with greasy mouthfeel, awful aftertaste. I hope this was sitting around way past its prime, because my bottle tasted just like a crappy high-gravity gas-station malt liquor. I couldn�t handle more than a few sips.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);1pt .9oz bottle in a shaker. Pours light golden with a lacy white head. Aroma pretty standard for a pale lager, but a little more bitterness and alcohol to it. Cereal and bread notes strong. Average texture. Would rather drink this than a lot of American lagers, but that�s not saying much.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Pours golden with brown taints and a white thick head, aroma of cheese, lemon, malt and rice, flavor of cardboard, malt, herbs, malt and cookies, quite watery.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Label on this bottle is totally different than this, must be this is the american version of the label. Looks like pale lager. Nice creamy head. Smell is a bit processed and metallic. Taste is a tad rubbery and bitter. Not hop bitter however, just rude bitter. This stuff reminds me of Rinku�kiai style beers. Rude crude and gets the dizzying job done. Strong personality of high gravity beer. Gets down to business. Bitter volatile medicine finish. Will not purchase again.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Slavutych Brewery--Mitsne--2006 16.9 oz. Bottle. 7.20% ABV. 20 IBU�s? (4.25 / 5.0) Malt Liquor. Foamy mild lace head. Clear bright thin yellow gold color. Crisp hot floral hop malt EtOH front. Rich creamy smooth sweet buttery caramel adjunct body. Clean hot EtOH hop spice end. Big smooth xtra Pils. Sampled 9/25/2006.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);bottle, sickly sweet corn aroma with a sticky white head. flavor is kind of flat bitter, not what I expected. pretty unappealing.
Slavutych Mitsne (Slavutich Special);Zaporizhzhya, Ukraine;Pilsener - Imperial;Slavutych (Carlsberg Ukraine);Underrated, in my opinion. For starters it�s very cheap considering you get a pint of 7.2% ABV beer for around $2.50. In terms of flavor it�s not the greatest, but it�s still a lot better than some bud/miller/coors type of lager. And it masks the alcohol very well, making it a fine session beer. I would buy it again.
Berliner Kindl B�renpils;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Oh shit this sad excuse for beer is all over Berlin! Probably the worst beerexperiance I ever had. Not even the worst beerfactorys in Sweden can beat this horrible drink.
Berliner Kindl B�renpils;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Oh dear. Even Germany can make thin, insipid, anonymous Pils. Next! Pale, aromaless, minimal bitterness. Yuck.

Berliner Kindl B�renpils;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);The head is unstable. It smells pilsener-spicy. The taste is spicy, uninteresting and watery. In the aftertaste a bit bitter. 5/5/6//7/67

Berliner Kindl B�renpils;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottle. Pale gold with no much head. Earthy hop aroma. Hoppy flavour with a slight bitter finish. Decent beer
Berliner Kindl B�renpils;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottle. Nice head with medium duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are malt and hops. Nice oily palate.
Berliner Kindl B�renpils;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);The bottle looks a bit like a cheap beer, the beer in the glass is okay, very zippy, nice head. Starts quite fresh-hoppy, not too dry, modest bitter in the background. Also some spicy-grasy notes. Finish still flowery-hoppy, but becomes milder and milder. Could be a little bit more intense, but still a good beer!
Neuzeller Closter Zell (Golden Abbot);Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Bottle. Deep golden beer. Clear. Tall frothy white head. The aroma is malty and estery. Almost banana-like. Nice. Medium body. Sweet malty taste. Those cute esters again. Very interesting.
Neuzeller Closter Zell (Golden Abbot);Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Its malty alright, and bready. Its not quite as sweet as it smells -- which is good. Mouthfeel is lacking, a little more flat than I prefer. Weird aftertaste.. a hint of copper. Not bad overall. OK.

Neuzeller Closter Zell (Golden Abbot);Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Pours dark golden with a fully receding off-white head. Aroma of sweet caramel and sticky bready. Taste is cloying caramel, light breadiness and cookie notes, with some umami in the background. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, sticky with moderate carbonation. Unpleasant sweetness and caramel flavors. I wasn�t a fan of this one.
Neuzeller Closter Zell (Golden Abbot);Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Pours a slightly clouded amber gold with a decent creme head. Nose is thick with carmalized sugar and a slight bit of cooked apples when you go deeper. Malt is there as well. Flavor is extremely sugary sweet. I get mild apples here,but more so the uncooked body of one and not the skins. Feel is okay. Low carbonation and a sticky syrupy edge to it as well. I can�t say I really appreciate this one too much. One too many things going in too far a direction.

Neuzeller Closter Zell (Golden Abbot);Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Light amber color with some variation from top to bottom. Bubbly white head dissipates at a medium pace. Very intriguing aroma...strong on raisins and brown sugar...much more complex than Lagers I�m accustomed to. Very sweet and sugary flavor is also high in malt and has strong hints of honey. Creamy smooth on the palate with a light aftertaste. This was an excellent lager IMO and something I would actually seek for in the future.
Neuzeller Closter Zell (Golden Abbot);Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Lots of sweet malt in the aroma.Pours a medium copper with a very small white head.The flavor is dominated by sweet malt and light fruit.Medium mouthfeel with a sweet finish.
Neuzeller Closter Zell (Golden Abbot);Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Clear golden, big head, average lacing. Aroma is bread and hints of grass. Creamy yet metallic mouthfeel. Almost graceful but slightly flawed. Solid regardless.
Neuzeller Closter Zell (Golden Abbot);Neuzelle, Brandenburg, Germany;Pilsener - Imperial;Klosterbrauerei Neuzelle;Bottle: Musty aroma wafts off this one -- a sugary sweet elixir that would probably attract hummingbirds. The flavor is richly malty and almost corn-bready. Would go great with some heavily gravied German fare.
Valhalla Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;A nice attempt at a malty dark scotch. dark brown color with red highlights and a frothy head. tastes of heavily roasted malt with caramel-like sweetness. Also has a nice spicy smoky aftertaste. A very good winterbrew.
Valhalla Belgian Triple;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;one of the more disapointing seasonals at valhalla. far too sweet with a bubblegum flavour. also lacked the zesty fruit and yeast taste of a good belgian ale. the smooth mouthfeel was its main redeeming feature
Millstream Hefe Weissen;Amana, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millstream Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle, cellar temp, Ayinger weizen glass, from Brennan�s in Monroe WI. Very pale gold, huge smooth head that diminishes a little quickly, some lacing...the fairly typical banana-bubblegum nose is accented a bit with lemon and faint vanilla; if there�s clove to be found, I haven�t...the body is lemony-tart, a bit more acidic than I expected at first, but a good bready malt develops and the acid fades away to a great extent, though never disappearing altogether...finish is tart, lightly acidic, with a nice full body that doesn�t quite get heavy, moderate carbonation. All in all pretty solid and better than I remember this brewery�s offerings being years ago."
Millstream Hefe Weissen;Amana, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millstream Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle into glass. Pours cloudy with off white head that diminishes quickly. Taste is not what I expected from a German Hefeweizen. Initial flavor sweet, finish odd.
Millstream Hefe Weissen;Amana, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millstream Brewing Company;Bottle poured a hazy tarnished gold with a lingering ring of white foam.

The bountiful snow-white head and hazy yellow body held so much promise but Millstreams Hefe Weissen ultimately let me down. The aroma�s not bad. It�s faint but has some clove spice and grains. The taste has cloves, wheat, and a touch of banana. I thought the spicy elements were too heavy and the sweet elements were underplayed. I wanted some bubblegum and cream but they were nowhere to be found. A distinct yeast taste was also missing from this brew. While the mouthfeel and appearance are almost perfect, this Hefeweizen could use some work in the taste and smell department(s).
Millstream Hefe Weissen;Amana, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millstream Brewing Company;"Bottle. Labeled Hefe ""R"" Weissen. Cow pic offered on the label. Bland murky light orange pour. Getting a little veggie soup, but mild. Wheat and mild spice. Not great."
Millstream Hefe Weissen;Amana, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millstream Brewing Company;"bottle @ John�s Grocery / Iowa City IA --- Cloudy dirty gold color, head that drops quickly to a light rim, no lace. Aroma of wheat and spice. Taste is normal going in - wheat malt with light spices; but, somewhere the spices take a wrong turn becoming sour. Doesn�t exactly fit. Not a keeper"
Millstream Hefe Weissen;Amana, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millstream Brewing Company;Bottle. A- Banana, wheat, spices. A- Golden color, cloudy liquid, white head. T- Banana, bubblegum, spices, wheat. P- Light body, average texture, average carbonation, wheaty finish. O- I like the name they use now with a cow on the bottle and calling it a Hefe R Weizen. Cleverly played. A pretty standard hefe in taste. Lots of bubblegum and banana. I could drink it although I wouldn�t seek it.
Millstream Hefe Weissen;Amana, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Millstream Brewing Company;Draft. Fairly bland hefe. Pours cloudy light yellow with white head. Some banana and wheat in the nose. Flavor is about the same.

Boulder Beer Buffalo Gold Premium Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boulder Beer Company;On tap at Boulder Beer at Denver International Airport, pours a clear copper golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out light crackery malt, not much else. Flavour is clean and light, with cereal malt sweetness, not a whole lot else. Clean and drinkable, but boring and forgettable.
Boulder Beer Buffalo Gold Premium Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boulder Beer Company;12 oz. can. Pour was golden with a lasting off white head. Aroma of sweet grain, grass, hops. Taste was light sweet, sour, bread, grassy hops.

Pours clear orange gold with a medium creamy white head that retains well and laces the glass some. The aroma is sweet vegetal malts with a little honey.

Boulder Beer Buffalo Gold Premium Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Tap at Ted�s. Orange-gold with a fine head. Nose of minerals, grapefruit, a touch of caramel. Quite simple. More citrus in the flavor. A decent, simple golden ale.
Boulder Beer Buffalo Gold Premium Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance � The beer is served a deep golden color with a tiny head of white foam. The head fades super fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell � The aroma of the brew is big of a bready aroma with a good showing of a caramel. Along with these smells comes some fruitiness of harvest fruits and a little bit of a hay smell. Taste- The taste begins with a rather thick bready taste mixed with a little bit of doughiness. Some fruitiness of harvest fruits (peach apricot and pear) develop more as the taste advances. Other flavors of a light herbal hop nature as well as tastes of caramel and a rather off musty tastes later come on. In the end, one is left with a odd, and slightly disagreeing malty and sort of sweet, but strangely hopped and musty taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the brew is slightly thicker with a carbonation level that is rather low. For the bready and sweet tastes of the brew it was OK, but a higher carbonation would have helped hide the must and made for a more refreshing brew. So overall it was just OK. Overall � Not really one I would necessarily recommend. It has an odd aftertaste and the flavors don�t really meld all that well together. Not one I will go back to any time soon.
Boulder Beer Buffalo Gold Premium Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boulder Beer Company;Poured from the 12oz can into a shaker glass. Golden color with a thick cream colored head. Aroma is a touch sweet and grainy with some grassy and floral hops. Flavor is the same. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. OK, not great.

Harpers Albert Avenue Amber;East Lansing, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harpers Brewing Company;This is a fine balanced beer with strong amber maltiness yet a distinct hoppiness reminiscent of a solid APA. I found it very tasty, rich and satisfying after my lackluster experience with Harper's pale. Hopefully I will get back to East Lansing soon to see if the other Harper's brews can bear out the promise of this one.

Club 621 House Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;MBC makes this for a pretentious little bar on Michigan Avenue in Lansing. It's a fair attempt with a decent does of hops but rather meek stuff, in final review. Good enough for sitting by the fire and listening to mediocre music - you don't feel bad standing up and abandoning the rest of the beer and the band.

Hansa Premium;Bergen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;Living in Norway, where this beer is from. I have never been a big fan of Hansa Brewery.

Hansa Premium;Bergen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;A light, fermented beer brewed with a piece of wheat flour. The bitter content is somewhat lower than for pilsner beer and draft beer. It is an anonymous beer for anyone who wants a lighter beer than pilsner and who does not really like beer. Tastes much better from bottle, from can almost without carbonic acid, boring, without taste of hops, nothing reminiscent of pilsner

Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Aroma: Bottle - low toasted malts, peanuts, touch of milk, low levels of caramel. The hops are not noticeable, and no other aromatics detected. Appearance: a clear Brown body with orange highlights on the edge of the glasses a light pierces the beer. The head is Tan in color, with a mixture of medium and small bubbles a little bit of lacing and low head retention but never fully dissipates. Flavor: The Malts provide a nice caramel backbone to this beer, a low but not overly powerfully sweet beer, The Toasted malts are prevalent making the balance of the beer malty. The bittering Hops are low not lingering on the back of the tongue just providing a nice crisp hop to the top of the tongue. The Finish is a low dryness and a residual sweetness. Mouthfeel: medium to low mouth feel comma with medium carbonation and no alcohol warmth. No noticeable astringency detected. Overall: overall not a bad nut brown ale, I has the caramel notes and a little bit of that Aroma and sweetness that I would expect out of a brown ale.
Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Oak Creek Brewing Company;4 oz. sample at the brew pub. Medium brown color. Ok, hard to excited about a brewpub brown ale.

Hansa Ice Beer;Bergen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;Pours a classic pale lager body with a fizzy, soap-bubbly head, which vanishes after a few secs. Smell is severe cooked vegetables and I�m really not looking forward to drinking this one. Oh Jesus. This is bad. Overtures of overcooked vegetables and soapy alkaline background notes, all wrapped in sweet malts and a watery mouthfeel to boot. This could easily be Hansa Borg�s worst beer. Absolutely detestable, and is saved from the slaughterhouse only by not actually making me sick. At least not completely. Drain pour 4 real.

Medium body and medium carbonation, could pass for either style.
Oak Creek Amber Ale;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Pours amber (surprising, I know) gold with little to no head or lacing. Scent is caramel, malt, and a light fruitiness. Taste is malt caramel, toffee, dark fruit, light baking spice, and the faintest of hop. Finishes with a little malty sweetness. First sip had me excited, but seemed to get more and more watered down with every sip. Disappointing final product is too watery and lacks carbonation. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Hansa Lemon Pilsner;Bergen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;Lemon soda drinkers will regard this one as a lousy lemon soda, beer drinkers will regard it as a lousy beer.

Marneys Red Ale;Bergen, Norway;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;Maybe I'm just excited by the fact that an ALE actually is brewed by a Norwegian macro brewery (WOW!) - but I do find this one quite drinkable. Moderate head, malty aroma, nutty flavour, sweetish aftertaste. Not outstanding, but a good try!
Marneys Red Ale;Bergen, Norway;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;Amber coloured. Sweetish, a little bit malty. One dimensional. A little reminding of Newcastle Brown Ale.
Marneys Red Ale;Bergen, Norway;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;After a good aroma there's nothing to cheer about. Would have been much better with 1 r 2 extra %.
Marneys Red Ale;Bergen, Norway;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;"Dark amber, very lager-like in its simplicity; more of those caramelly vienna malts this brewery loves. Overall bland and uninteresting."
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. When this was in Austin, it was okay. Then Satan came down and sent it to the Netherworld of Great Grains. This crap tastes like stagnant rainwater collected at the Balcones Fault restroom entrance. Sour, thin, and stinky.
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Lord let me just keep my mouth shut. Brewery was once in Austin. Have no earthly idea what is up with it now. Sigh. What once showed promise is ...??? I really don't have words.
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"If a ""pale malt"" is supposed to taste like this, it's a genre of beer I can do without. Totally bland, thin beer. It's kind of like they took a pale ale, then surgically removed the hops and the flavor. Stay away."
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"""Oh for heaven's sake"" was my first reaction to this beer as it passed between my lips. Why did they have to brew this stuff, sucking the joy out of the hobby of beer drinking? This has a syrupy feel to it at the start, although the palate is not supported enough to balance it. The flavor is dull and water-like--noticeable by its absence--with only hints of malt, hints of bitterness, hints of misery, and hints of despair. Miserable beer--a drain pour."
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;This had a nice dark color. Beyond that it was not worth the trouble. It had a decently sweet aftertaste, but otherwise had no flavor at all.
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. Copper color with basically no head. Light malts with a touch of passion fruit malt flavor. Wet.
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;I always try to support any microbrewery in the state of Texas just because it gives me hope that we could actually develop a market for good beer down here. This beer really scared me when there crap floating in my beer. I am still a rather young beer drinker so I am not sure what to make of this. On with the beer...It was very crisp and watery with a very slight alcohol/hops aroma which was actually decent. The beer it self just got worse and worse as I drank it though.
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Had the same mulchy-tobacco profile of their Red, but lighter. This was a good thing. Not a great pale.
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;I'm tasting ten pale ales today, back-to-back and the first thing I notice about this brew is: it's NOT a pale ale! There's no bitterness, but rather a fair amount of sourness and extremely subtle use of Kent Goldings. Don't go here looking for a bitter beer. Very SIMPLE beer with a slight metallic taste. I want these guys to keep brewing, though, so that someday Texas will not be laughed at when people think of the beer down here.
Balcones Fault Pale Malt;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;No head. Flat. Very yeasty flavor. A little odd. Can't decide if I like it or hate it.
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;"""nothing special here. the only thing that any kolsch can do to stand out is to be incredibly crisp and refreshing and this one isn�t. their scotch was awesome, otherwise...kinda lacking."""
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;Tap. Not really sure this should be called a Kolsh. It was quite sweet, but there was also some toast and some alcohol in the nose. It was a bright gold color and made me thinking that this is what a good malt liquor would taste like. The flavor was very similar to the aroma, but there was more alcohol flavor that I think need to be there for a beer of this strength.
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;On tap @ brewery Looks like this beer should be unretired. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a small white head. Light lacing. Aroma is light grain malt and faint esters. Flavor is light malt and esters with a touch of citrus. Light body. A decent beer.
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;Draft at Flour City Brewfest. I hope this is the one I tested there. I only wrote down �Gold� and �Good with lite hops� for this one.
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;cuts the edge of the style. Cloudy blonde, like my kids� hair. Creamy mouthfeel. German pearly hops used, and some wheat. Citrus on the lemony side. Refreshing clean with nice finish not so dry. A winning summer brew. Tim, bottle this one please.
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;Lemon butter nose with floral hops. Golden yellow body with a faint head. Flowery hops continue into the flavor where they are decently balanced with malt and butterscotch. Citrusy aftertaste
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;Draft at brewery. Golden yellow colour with good clarity and white head that didn't stay too long. Bit of light grainy/grassy hops in the aroma, clean crisp flavour is dominated by a moderate bitterness with a good malt backbone, pretty well balanced. Slightly dry finish with a hint of astringency at the end.
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;Golden color, smaller white head, long lasting. Lighter herbal hop aroma with a bit of malt. Malt up front with a fair amount of hops behind it. Softer feel, crisp and clean. Not great but pretty drinkable.
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;Light, bright white head. True to Kolsch look but head lasted longer than in those I try before. Clean light aroma with slightly more accent on hops. Very soft like Kolsch blended with crisper more refreshing hop bite. That makes this beer very drinkable. If not presence of hops true Kolsch, very interesting hybrid Kolsch-IPA. Nice, more of that please!
Flying Bison Dawn Patrol Gold;Buffalo, New York, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Flying Bison Brewing;Malty, flowery aroma, golden, with a small white head. Soft malt flavour, crisp, clean. A nice beer, but not a kolsch.

Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;Tap at Sportsmens Tavern, Buffalo, NY. Pours reddish. Caramel malt, light citrus in the nose. Flavor is bittersweet caramel malt, slight fruitiness, and almost a hint of coffee. Very drinkable.
Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;Pours amber with a tan head. Aroma is caramel, chocolate and light roast. Taste is more sweet then bitter. Medium bodied, smooth texture and overall a solid Irish Ale.
Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;12 oz bottle from Tops in Niagara Falls, NY The ale poured a clear ruby red with a beige head and lacing. This is very attractive ale. The aroma of caramel malts greets you. This ale is light on the hops. The taste has some earthy notes to it. The ale has a medium body and average carbonation. Another easy drinking beer with a nice clean finish.
Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;APPEARANCE- Reddish tinted amber color. Good head retention but no lacing. NOSE- nicely malty, slightest bit of hop bitterness. FLAVOR- surprisingly complex. Malty sweet start which seamlessly gives way to just a touch of bitterness in the finish. That slightly bitter beauty stays on my tongue for quite a while after I finish the sip.
Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;Bottled. Hoppy aroma. The taste is musty, it�s actually a nice impression of an Irish beer but tastes like it has more alcohol than 4%.
Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;Tap @ Schwabl�s. Copper with oatmeal head. Smells dark dry fruity and wheaty. First set, then a light hop character kicker in. a tad watery and wheaty.
Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;Great tasting beer. It�s more of a brown ale than an Irish red. It has a subtle taste of unsweetened iced tea / coffee. I was impressed by it.
Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;I don�t know what an Irish ale even is but this is a pretty good brown or amber. It is a nice garnet color with a thin but long lived had of fine bubbles. It is a touch roasty with some nut and toffee notes. This struck me as a bit metallic or oxidized at first but that seems to wane quickly as you drink it. This is fairly light on the palate with moderate carbonation but still rather full flavored. Some dark fruity notes cine out in the finish along with a solid bit of bitterness. This is definitely one worth trying for fans of whatever style this is.
Flying Bison Aviator Red;Buffalo, New York, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flying Bison Brewing;This ale poured a deep red colour with a minimal head. Scents include light hop, malt and... not too much. First swig was medium bodied with nice malt flavours and a light hop. Finish is malty with very light smoke. Very nice!
Flying Bison Skye Pilot Scotch Ale;Buffalo, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flying Bison Brewing;"""Yum. Rich and malty indeed, this was one good brew. Liberal use of peet malt obvious in all aspects, which is great. Wonderful body, good all around...and it�s full enough to be a scotch, not a scottish."""
Flying Bison Skye Pilot Scotch Ale;Buffalo, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flying Bison Brewing;On tap at Sidebar in Buffalo. An orangey/brown pour with a white head. Smells malty, tastes malty as well. It has a sweet taste, hard to put a finger on it. Kinda nutty in the flavor. Creamier mouthfeel than I expected. It wasn�t exceptional, but not that bad.
Flying Bison Skye Pilot Scotch Ale;Buffalo, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flying Bison Brewing;Growler fill from consumers in N.F. Pours copper orange with a beige head.

Flying Bison Skye Pilot Scotch Ale;Buffalo, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flying Bison Brewing;On tap @ Coles Buffalo NY. One of the better if not the best offering from Flying Bison. Deep amber, toastiness, slight smoke, mild to medium sugar sweetness. Not bad
Flying Bison Skye Pilot Scotch Ale;Buffalo, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flying Bison Brewing;Draught at Cole�s, Buffalo, NY. Pours a slightly hazy dark orange-amber with an average size diminishing off-white head. Mild aroma of lightly toasted caramel malt, light smoke and chocolate. Flavour of toasty caramel, some hops, roasted brown sugar and just a hint of smoke. Medium bodied. Nice enough version of the style, I enjoyed it.
Flying Bison Skye Pilot Scotch Ale;Buffalo, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Flying Bison Brewing;tastes like someone dumped a shot of scotch in my beer! smokey flavor, scotch taste overwhelms. not my cup o� tea but if you like a boozey brew give her a try.

Buffalo Tap Room IPA;Tonawanda, New York, United States;IPA;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;Nice, hoppy, and only $2 for a bottle at the cross eyed cricket in Vidalia ga. Not the most hoppy or complex IPA out there, but worth a try. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Buffalo Tap Room IPA;Tonawanda, New York, United States;IPA;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;Had this one on tap at the brewery after the Unfiltered Rye. Thankfully, this was much better, though I certainly wouldn�t call it great. Similar in color with the golden yellow, but very foamy head. Had a little tiny bit of hop bitterness, though I didn�t really get a ton from it. I�d drink it again if I were there.
Buffalo Tap Room IPA;Tonawanda, New York, United States;IPA;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;On tap sample at Custom Brewcrafters in Honeoye Falls, NY. Clear deep gold with a small head and excellent lacing. Aroma is a mix of piney hops with a bit of grainy malt coming through. Not a strong aroma though. Piney hops dominate the taste but again some malt comes through. OK taste, but nothing special. Mouthfeel of medium body and carbonation. Other all a drinkable IPA. Average or below for IPAs, but better than the typical house-named brew IPA. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Buffalo Tap Room IPA;Tonawanda, New York, United States;IPA;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;2010 Autumn Festival of Ales. Alot of hops in the aroma. Flavor mostly of hops and not much malt. Sharp bite at end.

Buffalo Tap Room IPA;Tonawanda, New York, United States;IPA;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;(draft @ 2006 Autumn Festival of Ales - Honeoye Falls, NY) Bronze in color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is loaded with hops. Very flavorful and floral. Flavor is very hoppy and bitter with loads of hops that aren�t blended with the malts unlike the other IPA�s that are made by these guys. The hops and malts are definitely a separate entity and very tasty. Didn�t know that the alcohol was that high. Real nice IPA.
Buffalo Tap Room IPA;Tonawanda, New York, United States;IPA;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;A yellow colored beer with a disappearing white head. It has a weak aroma reminiscent of cascade hops. Like a true IPA should be, it is balanced well towards the hop side of the flavor spectrum. Has a strong piney, grapefruity hop flavor and a lingering bitterness. Definitely for the hop lovers among us. Not a world-beater of an IPA, but a good representative.
Buffalo Tap Room IPA;Tonawanda, New York, United States;IPA;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;Hazy yellow-amber. Thin finger of yellowish foam. Very light hop aroma of citrus & pine. Light feel w/ only the slightest stickiness. A relatively bland IPA, w/ some maltiness & some citrusy hops.
Buffalo Tap Room IPA;Tonawanda, New York, United States;IPA;Buffalo Tap Room & Grill;Done like an IPA should be. Nice an hoppy flavor and smell..................
Custom Brewcrafters Christmas Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;Toasted cereal smell, taste is same, low carbonation, no diversity, very standard, in Syracuse for 15th high school reunion
Custom Brewcrafters Christmas Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance � The beer pours a deep golden amber color with a one finger head of white. The head fades very fast leaving a trace level of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell � The aroma of the beer is heaviest of a caramel and malty smell mixed with lighter notes of a roasted malt and a moderate showing of some spice aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Some lighter smells of a toasted nut and a little bit of toffee are there as well producing the relatively standard �holiday brew� aroma overall. Taste � The taste begins with a thick and bready toasted malt taste with a rather strong showing of toffee and caramel. As the taste advances the spices that were detected in the nose starts coming to the tongue and with these tastes comes a slight buttering of the flavor with the caramel taking on a slightly more butterscotch flavor. All the while the roastedness gets enhanced a bit and a light nutty taste and a bit of a boozy flavor join the flavor profile as well. In the end the mix of flavors ends up leaving a nicely spiced warming flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both are nice for the toasted and sweet flavors of the brew all while really helping create a thicker and chewier base for the nice warming malty flavor. Overall � A fairly nice Christmas brew overall with a good showing of spice, sweet malts and a nice warming touch. Not bad.

Nice dark brown pour. Aroma of Christmas spices of cinnamon,ginger and nutmeg. Malty body with flavors of cinnamon nutmeg and the like. Enjoyable
Custom Brewcrafters Christmas Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;In years past it has been better. This is the first year it�s been available in bottles, and only as part of a mix pack. The color was a nice red that went well with Christmas, and it poured with a nice head out of the 12oz bottle. Carbonation was good, but it didn�t have the spice characteristic of previous years. It tasted more like a yeasty red, than the Christmas Ale I�ve come to expect. It�s still good, just not as good as years past.
Custom Brewcrafters Christmas Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;draft. pours orange amber with one finger off white head. sweet, and somewhat spicey (ginger) aroma. dry palate. tastes of brown sugar and stale malts. carbonation is fizzy. overall it was not unpleasant but the stale and sugary flavors made it less than crisp. kind of hung in the mouth. tastes like a lot of their brews, this time with some spice. meh.
Custom Brewcrafters Christmas Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;Draft. Dark red body, small head, spice and malts in the nose. Spicy, malty, forgettable.
Custom Brewcrafters Christmas Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;"Rated while drinking: Pours a very ruby red color with a small off-white head. Sweet malts and as others have mentioned, quite a bit of ginger stuffed in there. The gingerbread aroma carries over into the flavor ten-fold to make a very different type of ""Christmas Beer"". The palate seems a bit harsh at times, but drinking directly out of the growler probably doesn�t help that. Worth a shot."
Custom Brewcrafters Christmas Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;draft- super caramel, much like many of the cb brews, with some nice munich maltyness, and hints of spice. Drinkable.
Pearl Street IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);Significant bitterness, hop heads may prefer the new ESB for a fix. Not bad, though a tad metallic, drinkable.
Pearl Street IPA;Buffalo, New York, United States;IPA;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);"Served on tap at a dingy little dive in LaCrosse Wisconsin; the city it calls home. Quite hoppy and malty, yet quite lack-luster. Perhaps it was my mood, perhaps it was the rudeness of the leary-eyed and freshly shorn bartender, but I just couldn't get into this beer. The balance of hops and malt were ""off the mark"". Not great, not crap, but decent or slightly above."

Pearl Street Burnies Nut Brown;Buffalo, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);Standard Nut Brown that has a Newcastle sort of feel to it. There is nothing that stands out in this one. Chocolate and nut fill this brew with a slightly smokey flavor. Great aroma though.

Pearl Street Burnies Nut Brown;Buffalo, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);Had this at Shea's beer fest thingy. POurs a typical brown/porter color. Aroma is of chocolate/coffee. Roasty taste. Seems more like a porter than a brown.
Pearl Street Burnies Nut Brown;Buffalo, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);Not a fan. Served on tap in a resturant down the street from the source. Quite flat, even for a brown, and tasted more like iced tea with hops than anything I would taxonomically classify as beer. As for head, if it had any, it dissapated well before the waitress brought it to me. Overall, quite stale and I'm afraid that is the flavor they were going for.
Pearl Street Burnies Nut Brown;Buffalo, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);A MILD English-style brown ale, in the vein of Newcastle Brown. Sort of coats the stomach like Pepto-Bismol. A light, pleasant body.

Pearl Street Lake Effect Pale Ale;Buffalo, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);The body has a deep golden/orange amber color with good clarity and some nice visible carbonation. The head was white in color, average in size and quick fading to a small ring of foam that left some spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma brings nice citrusy hops over soft sweet caramel malty notes. The favor had a quick flash of sweet malt followed by decent burst of juicy citrusy hops.

Not sure how I�ve never reviewed this before, seems I�ve had it plenty of times. It�s nothing too special, pours a nice amber color and is pretty simple. A good bit of malt, not a ton of hops in it.

Lucknow Blonde Ale;Moultonborough, New Hampshire, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Springs Brewing Co. - Lucknow;Decent summer ale, but this wasn't Lucknow's best effort. Maybe because the other brews by them were complex but still balanced, this one seemed to fall flat. Not a BAD beer, just a mediocre, non-Lucknowish beer.

Hudson Valley Amber;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;Bottle. An interesting beer indeed. I don�t know if these guys are a brewery or are having it contract brewed. Tasted more like an old ale than an amber, which makes me think this may be a bit old. Not that it�s a bad thing, as I really like old ales. Slightly oxidized and pretty malty stuff. The aroma had some malt and esters. Not bad at all.
Hudson Valley Amber;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River Horse Brewing Company;You know, this may be the best amber ale I've ever had. In fact, it's very much an ESB. Pours a deep amber color with just a light misting of head. Aroma is very malty and estery. Fruity, with a bit of floral hoppiness. Flavor is rich and malty, with a pear/apple fruiiness complimenting the mild hoppy bitterness. The finish is long, and leaves you wanting another sip, and another. The beer is medium to full bodied, and way beyond my expectations. I loved this stuff!
Hudson Valley Old Man Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - English;River Horse Brewing Company;Pours a deep earthy brown, with a thin almond head. Looks good so far. Aroma is malty, with a bit of roastiness and estery pale malt sweetness. A nice mix of both. I really can't detect much in the way of hops. Flavor is surprisingly mild, sweet and a little bready. A touch of roasty bittersweetness, with mild estery fruitiness. It comes through in the aroma, but not much in the flavor, which is a shame. It tastes sort of like an old ale, but I can never really tell. Moderate carbonation, could use a little more fruitiness, overall pretty decent, but I doubt I'll get this again.
Hudson Valley Old Man Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - English;River Horse Brewing Company;"So the beer expert/store clerk told me this brewery has called it a day. Generally, that's sort of sad, but when it happens to a lame brewery, that's just survival of the fittest, baby! This beer had very little head and a bit of an alcohol burn. Oddly, every beer label this brewery has depicts the act of sleeping - obviously a lot of late nights were spent brewing this stuff. Excellent aroma and a very malty ale with significant nuttiness (good), but it's the spiciness that most jumps out at you. Rather complex and worthy of some respect. Reminds me of something the much-lauded Southampton Publick House might come up with. I don't often get psyched about a spicy, hoppy, ""big"" beer, so take note."
Hudson Valley Old Man Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - English;River Horse Brewing Company;I really don't know what to say about this. It is a pretty stardard English Strong Ale. It lacks a certain depth of characer that the good ones have, and it is a bit thin bodied, with a somewhat watery finish. The aroma and flavor are roasty and nutty, but not extremely impressive. A pretty middle-of-the-road beer.
Hudson Valley Old Man Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - English;River Horse Brewing Company;This is a decent English Strong Ale. Dark amber in color, a tiny lacing around the sides of the glass. A slight essence of chocolate malts in the flavor and aroma. Very smooth and drinkable.
Hudson Valley Old Man Ale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Strong Ale - English;River Horse Brewing Company;Copper with tiny particles fogging the almost clear liquid. Thin, fizzy edge head. Single lined carbonation. Decent aroma of fruity alcohol esters is quickly met with a grassy, hay aspect and hints of bubblegum. Mildly airy body. Initial fruitiness fades, replaced by a bitter fruit skin flavor and dry malt husk flavor. Medium thick. Very dry, almost too dry. Fruity alcohol is warming with notes of black cherries. No discernable malt flavors. Finishes mild, cottony and with floral hop notes. Very average for an old ale, heck even a plain ale. Contract brewed by River Horse Brewing Co. Go figure?
Hudson Valley Rips Hop Awakening Pale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;Hmmm. Hoppy for sure, but not much beyond that. Lacking the complexity of flavor that makes the good american pale ales great. Not much in the way of esters, and malts are a little too bland and understated.
Hudson Valley Rips Hop Awakening Pale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;Nicely hopped, grapefruit-like flavor to this APA. Lots of citrus stuff going on. Maybe papaya? Dry finish, no lingering bitterness.
Hudson Valley Rips Hop Awakening Pale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;This is one hell of a clean, crisp, refreshing, well-hopped APA. Nice cascade hops in the aroma. Nice little malty sweetness on the tongue. Slighty hoppy finish. Each sip makes you thirst for more. I think I've found a new staple summer pale ale to go along with Blue Point Pale Ale.
Hudson Valley Rips Hop Awakening Pale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;very crisp and refreshing. A strong hoppy after taste. ...................

Hudson Valley Rips Hop Awakening Pale;Ewing, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;River Horse Brewing Company;Clear gold. Huge hoppy aroma.

Kronenbourg Tradition Allemande;Obernai, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);I don't know how the majority of beers I tried in France ended up being in the Kronenbourg line. They have all been below average, and this is no exception. Dark gold with a thin white head. Indistinct aroma of hops and skunk. Light-bodied and fizzy with a yucky vegetable and musty hop flavor. The finish doesn't help matters by being kind of foul too. Avoid if possible.
Kronenbourg Tradition Allemande;Obernai, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);Weak aroma. Light sweetness from malts/corn? Low level of hops - sort of a chemical bitterness. Hint of diacetyl, too. Clear dull golden-yellow, with wispy white head - no lacing. Medium heavy watery body, like softened water, and medium to heavy carbonation. Taste is that of the standard Kronenbourg lager, with some extra hops added. Effect is a mildly bitter start - hardly any sweetness or malt profile that, with the extra carbonation - gives way to a medium-heavy bitter finish. Some chalkiness or carbonic burn on the tongue, too. After is a harsh chemical bitterness with medium staying power. Not a pleasant bitter as in a good classic pils. Tolerable cold, but worsens considerably when it starts to warm up.
Kronenbourg Tradition Allemande;Obernai, France;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);"Light amber; hint of caramel; touch of crispy hop. Not real German........."

Vestfyen Ale 3.5;Assens, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;A nice, malty brew that's worth seeking out if you're ever in Sweden. One of the best beers I tried while there. Though the aroma was a bit lacking, overall you could do much worse than Vestfyen Genuine Ale.
Vestfyen Ale 3.5;Assens, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;"A beutiful golden brown color with an OK but fast disappearing head. The aroma is very slight with notes of sweetness. The flavor is very neutral; slightly sweet to start off, then malty and a little bitter in the end. It has a fine balance, but in general its a boring ale. I had expected much more since Vestfyen brews Refsvindinge AZ Ale no. 16 under licence, so they must know how to make a great ale."
Vestfyen Ale 3.5;Assens, Denmark;Pale Ale - English;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;The brewer at Festfyen does'nt know what a Ale is. Shame on him. And shame on Vestfyen.

Nils Oscar Kalasjul�l;Nyk�ping, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Nils Oscar;"31-01-2019; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The beer looks very nice. The colour of the beer is a lovely blend of amber and ruby red. The beer is crystal clear. Some bubbles are rising towards the top, whether they form a frothy orange-brown tinted layer of foam. It looks quite nice. It has a lovely ruby red glow. The aroma of the beer is fine. Malts give a nice plain malty note. There are some aromas of liquorice, though not to strong. There is also a tiny bit of winter spice. Also a nice fruity aroma is present, reminding me of lingonberry. Hops give a spicy note, though not to strong. It is quite nice. The taste of the beer is also nice. Medium sweetness, nice bitter note and a tiny fruity acidity and liquorice savouriness. It is quite well balanced. I like it. The palate of the beer is average. Light body, a bit rough and medium carbonation. The finish of the beer is short. It has some herbal bitterness, but that's it. Not too interesting in the finish. But, allover, it is a nice beer."

Keizersberg Tripel;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"29 April 2019. At Zeiven Uke, Leuven - shared with Anke! Pours clear golden with a huge, slowly collapsing, foamy, white head; lots of lacing. Aroma of yeast, old apple sauce, dried banana & apricot, breadcrust, clove, faint cabbage. Taste is light to medium fruity sweet, estery banana & apple peel, topped with white sugar, some (retronasal) cabbage again, clove-like phenols next to bitter grass & pepper, all the while yeasty. Dry, grassy hoppy finish, spicy-phenolic still, more yeast, and some warming, not too subtle, jenever-like alcohol. Medium body, thinnish oily texture, lively carbonation. Not a very refined Tripel but there are other, more obnoxious examples out there, so it�s decent enough for a sunny day in spring."

Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;Fine, really. Super clean and refreshing. Offers a lot of light green notes, apples. Pear. Quite malty! Enjoyed it. Fresh.
Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;"Pours golden with an off-white head. The aromas are halfway between a typical blond ale and a cider, summarised in ""apple and malt"". The flavour profile, sweeter, carries the malt and fruitiness from the aroma with the minor addition of bitter hops. The apple and malt still dominate but at least not entirely unbalanced. Medium body, oily, low carbonation and gradual finish. OK."
Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;Middle of the road beer. Pale gold, white head. Initially sweet, as is the aroma, although there are some dry hops in the finish.

Some unfortunate cardboard coming through at the very end.
Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;Bottle at home. Golden ale indeed, clear, foamy white head. Easily drinkable pilsener, light hop bitterness. Light bodied, medium carbonation.
Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;I found this a pleasant, nicely balanced, gentle beer. Fairly malty smell but with a small hop note. The flavour is well rounded, though mutedly. Quite a honeyed tone to the initial sweetness, followed by a growing hops presence that adds a light bitterness that does not leave a bad aftertaste. It doesn't have anything quirky or different about it, but Exmoor Gold is a likable, inoffensive drink--one that could be quaffed while concentrating on something else, as it doesn't insist on itself in the mouth.
Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;Nice enough golden ale. Light golden colour. Light biscuity malt flavour and hop bitterness.
Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;500ml bottle: BBD 26th Sep 18. Drank at home on mid Nov 17. Poured into an Abbot Ale pint glass tankard, it looked good, clear and clean body of golden sunlight, on top a full and deep white blanket of foam. The aroma was a mixture of light maltiness and mild orange citrus esters. The taste followed along the same lines. Easy drinking beer with just about enough flavour to keep you interested until the last drop, nicely balanced, simple beer.
Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;Bottle from Crocombe's, Lynmouth. Golden with a thin head. Has a distinctively British hoppiness, reminding me of several Shepherd Neame type brews. It's a decent enough golden ale.
Exmoor Gold (Bottle);Wiveliscombe, Somerset, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exmoor Ales;I used to seek this out in my younger days, but now I question why! It poured nicely and looked good in the tankard. The flavour was some bitter hops and lots of wheat. Overall I didn't enjoy it, but perhaps I should have chilled it to within an inch of its life.

There is a mild sweetness and nuttiness that goes along with this. Very surprising brew from these guys.

This one presents the nicest of this breweries offerings, I�m hopeful� Taste-this does come across with the malt and hops balanced, but the flavor is muddled. Could some of these been that the current batches were off of their regular quality? Or, the glasses the beers were poured into were skunky? Either way, disappointed yet again.

Heritage Premium Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kichesippi Beer Company;Originally rated February 2006. Comes in a stubby bottle. This premium lager pours a golden colour with an amber touch. Carbonation is quite present, big white head with medium retention and good all around lacing. The nose is very nice, with floral notes and a beautiful perfume. The mouthfeel is the weakest part, being a bit thin and watery, but then, the taste bring you back right into it. Grainy malt, floral hops, slight fruit and a dry and mild bitter finish. Not much of an aftertaste. Recommended for a good alternative to macro lagers, and for a good intro to micro-breweries.
Heritage Premium Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kichesippi Beer Company;Draught. Pours a pale amber-copper colour with a good white head.

Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws (2001-2002);Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;355ml bottle @ home. 2002 vintage. Pours a hazy copper brown colour with a tiny beige head. Nose is cardboard, dark fruits, and caramel. Flavour is caramel, light dark fruits, burnt brown sugar, light oxidation, and a metallic character. I suspect the metallic character might be from the bottle cap, as it was stored on its side and looks a tad rusty. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, and a medium sweetness with mild bitterness. Surprisingly has held up well.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws (2001-2002);Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;"Courtesy of Brian, Slack BIF; vintage 2002, 15+ years old Filthy brown with no head. The aroma is malty, fruity, some fudge, light signs of oxidization. The body is thinning, some malt flavor, rather strong oxidization, but not extreme; some tobacco, some cardboard. Old but still almost enjoyable."

Nose is full of cardboard - oh man, is that oxidized - along with subdued caramel and dark fruits. Flavour is less pronouncedly oxidized, with lots of caramel, dark fruits, some brown sugar and a bit of astringency. It's oxidized, but not too detractingly so, especially for a 16-year old beer. Pleasure to drink after all this time, despite the obvious flaws.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws (2001-2002);Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Thanks a bunch to douglas88 for sharing this 2002 bottle - pours golden / orange with an off-white head.

Decently oxidized. M: Medium body, light alcohol presence, soft carbonation. O: Tasty barleywine that�s holding up fantastically even at 13 years old. Oxidation adds rather than detracts.
Hair of the Dog Doggie Claws (2001-2002);Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;2002 bottle. Very cool to try this.

I figured my chance to try this one was long past, so big thanks to the folks at Last Drop for putting this event together and digging up some cool, old HOTD bottles. Anyway, the beer. Pours a murky orange-gold with a small ring of bubbles. I don�t know why it impresses me when old beers are carbonated, but it does. Aroma of melted caramels, plum, apple, toffee, sherry, nuts. Taste: definitely tastes old, but less oxidized than the 2006 sample was. Moderately sweet, just the slightest hint of bitterness at the end, lasting finish on the dry side. This is one worth sipping. Smooth, creamy, slick medium-full body. Overall: I�m impressed by how well this held up. Probably just a bit past its peak, but still a magnificent beer.

Sprecher Abbey Triple;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Sprecher Brewing Company;Perky gold-copper beer with a thin white head and loads of rising bubbles.

I havent had any other triples before, but if this is what most triples are like, im definitely not buying any others.

Heritage Traditional Dark Lager;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kichesippi Beer Company;Originally rated August 2004. Tried this beer for the first time at Zaphod�s in Ottawa, on tap, a few years ago. Was blown away ! Now I buy it in a 6 pack of stubbies.

North Peak Scotch Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;North Peak Brewing Company;Now this is a good beer from North Peak - a hugely warm, rich maltiness and nice caramelity.

North Peak Black Ice Lager;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;North Peak Brewing Company;Interesting. It is certainly not just another darkly colored brew, but its grainy, sparky texture is odd in a lager. A bit sweet, a bit chewy - worth checking out.

Dark Horse Amber Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Apparently intended as a Belgian style amber rather than American style, makes me curious. Regular, medium thick, off-white, moussy and well-retaining head remaining almost completely closed for most of the time, crowning a clear, very pure and deeply orangey to copper-hued amber beer with lively fizz in narrow strings rising up from the bottom - looks beautiful. Adding the sediment brings a more murky appearance with a brownish tinge. Pleasant aroma of marmelade, candied orange, biscuit, minerals, dried flowers, strawberry, cloves (phenols in other words, becoming even slighly medicinal with sediment added), hay, ripe melon, white bread crumbs, dust, banana peel, old cloth, some onsetting �rusty� oxidation but actually adding something pleasant rather than disturbing (the bottle must be a few years old, but I cannot find any date). Cleanly fruity onset, hints of peach, green banana, melon and apricot, sweetish with a very soft, �dim� sourish touch, minerally carbonation, bit spritzy, lively but not overcarbonated for this style. Soft, rounded, malty middle, caramelly sweet and a tad nutty with a mildly bitterish toasted edge at the end, supporting a gentle but adequate, floral, slightly peppery, hayish hop bitterness, drying the back of the mouth. Easygoing but very pleasant and elegant beer, not really suffering from old age though it probably shouldn�t become much older than this. As for the Belgian aspect: I still find it more akin to American amber ales than to true �sp�ciale belge�, for which it is somewhat too clean and shows a tad too much hop bitterness (though the phenols are certainly there) - but don�t get me wrong here, I generally prefer American ambers above their Belgian counterparts and this, whatever substyle it represents, it a very enjoyable example.

Dark Horse Amber Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from the sampler case. Just an average amber ale with nothing special or outstanding to speak of in taste or appreciation.
Dark Horse Amber Ale;Marshall, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dark Horse Brewing Company;BOD 10/30/15. Pours a cloudy amber. Normal head volume, below average retention and no lacing. Good nose of light toasted bready malt with hints of slightly sweet fruit (banana, pear). Medium body that has a touch of creaminess to its otherwise smooth texture. Normal carbonation with a touch of effervescence in the middle and a stronger finish. The flavor profile is tasty and very good, though atypical for even a Belgian amber. Intensity is reasonable, balance is outstanding and complexity quite good. Flavor arrives in a blend then separates in the middle. Initially there is a wave of fruit, a touch of spice and a toasted/nutty aspect. The middle has just enough bitterness to notice and has a subtle sweetness. As this bitterness trails off, separation occurs and banana, pear and a touch of clove emerge over a bready slightly nutty base. The finish is a slow fade of the previous flavors that becomes slightly phenolic.

Limburg Witbier;Auckland, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Steam Brewing Company;Interesting to read Yalnikim�s comments on the bottled version, because our sample was very disappointing. The �Best by� date on the bottle was illegible but I suspect this was past its best. The piffling head atop a murky orange-dun coloured brew was the first clue that all was not well. The aroma seemed fresh enough, with a distinct orange peel tang, hot Weetbix, and some faint but odd cocoa powder. But the palate was tired and lifeless. Lots of coriander and wheat in the mouth with quenching citric sourness. Not a patch on the wonderful Hopsmacker but I�d like to give this another go with a bottle that is definitely fresh. (330ml bottle from Scenic Cellars, Taupo)

Limburg Witbier;Auckland, New Zealand;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Steam Brewing Company;Tasted 19/02/2006. 330ml bottle, with the new branding, from Moore Wilson�s in Wellington. Dirty yellow-gold, very hazy, with an airy white head that disappears quickly and leaves no trace. Lollies, banana and phnolic esters dominate the nose with some citrus struggling through and a touch of seaweed later (I suspect the warm storage at Moore Wilsons was not the best). Flavour has not been affected as badly: sweetish wheaty grains up front, peppery and tart through the mid-palate, with a long clove-like finish. Great weight in the mouth, not at all watery at all, with a spritzy carbonation. I remember this being a lot more traditionally citrus/spice, so this rating probably reflects Moore Wilsons more than Limburg. To re-evaluate this one next time it is on tap at Bar Edwards, Newtown. 04/04/2005. Popped into Bar Edward�s on the way home, for a sample, and this is a far better beer than what was coming out of Moore Wilson�s. Be warned.

Pilot Bay Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;i didn't mind this too much. it certainly tastes like generic lager from the brewing 3rd world but at least it has some actual bitterness in the finish rather than some sweet dryness
Pilot Bay Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;There is the Seinfeld episode where the 'Soup Nazi' protects his recipes as if they are the codes to the US nuclear strike force activation program. Then there must be the recipe that no-one cares about. Like scones, or bread. You know, it's add ingredient (a) to (b) to (c). Anyway, they got hold of the generic recipe for a lager, and said, 'hey, let's brew a lager'. They did, followed the recipe, and failed to do anything spectacular, or more than ordinary.

Farbe: Gelb, Klar, Wenig Schaum Aroma: S�uerlich, Grapefruit, Zitrone. Geschmack: S�uerlich. Zitrus, etwas Getreide. Erfrischend aber kommt an die guten Sommer Ales bei weitem nicht heran.
Blue Point Summer Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);I also found this to be Kolschish. For summer brews, I am finding better out there. Kind of boring, but on the other hand crisp and refreshing. Not much flavor here...compared to Harpoon's or Brooklyn's summer which has a bit more taste to it. Glad I only tried a single. I would actually go with something like Blue Point's Toasted Lager or their Pale Ale. This one was a miss.

Blue Point Summer Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Great summer all day beer with more flavor than a big national brew, still light enoughto drink multiple on a hot day, good flavor and a bit of citrus citrus but not overboard to make it a perfect tasty brew for the summer. Drank from a can at a bbq and really liked this beer for the summer
Blue Point Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);This is actually more of an American Pale ale vs. IPA. Some floralness in there. Not too bitter or overly hoppy. I am finding the balance quite nice, and the mouthfeel crisp and feels dry or fresh hopped. My third sample from Blue Point and finding them aight. Liked the toasted coconut lager and this pale ale, but didn't care too much for their rye. A solid pale ale though. Not complaining at all for a $3 bomber.

Blue Point Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);"Bomber as ""American Pale Ale"", can only assume its this beer. Got the bomber at Publix in Orange Park FL while on a short weekend trip to work on the in-law�s house. Finally a night alone! After working, we got snacks, beer, and some movies. Ate the snacks, watched the movies, drank the beer, screwed mightily in an empty house. And the beer was refreshing enough, crisp, clean and lean bready malts with a pleasing citrusy hop. Light bodied. Golden with a large fluffy head."

Aroma is light hops. Taste is sweet fresh hops, hint of wheat. Light and kinda drinkable, a bit boring, okay.
Blue Point Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Rated on 5-28-2012 (Bottle) When poured, the head is medium sized, frothy, fizzy, and white. The body is pale yellow and transparent. This beer has very fizzy, fast rising carbonation and a fair amount of lacing. The aroma is hops, caramel malt, wheat, musty, and some farmhouse. The flavor is lightly sweet, citrus, pine, floral hops, and malt. The mouthfeel is lively and this beer is light-medium bodied. The hops are upfront in the aroma and flavor. This beer is a little too hoppy tasting for this non hop head.
Blue Point Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Pours wee wee yellow, thin white head that goes quickly, little lacing. Quite citrus even pine in the nose. Balanced but very carbonated. Refreshing. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Blue Point Pale Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);22 oz bomber The APA pours a hazy golden color with a solid long lasting creamy foam. This ale also had nice lacing. The aroma was of piney hops and caramel. The Carapils malts also add aromas including toffee, caramel, nutty, raisin-like and sherry and is also responsible for an increase in color. The ale has a nice medium body and average carbonation with an assertive bitterness. This is nice pale ale but lacks in complexity. Could be better: increade IBUs and ABV.

Carbonation bubbles up glass. Aroma: cocoa, molasses, raisins. Taste: all of the above, plus dates. Mouthfeel; creamy, silky texture. Fairly well-balanced. For an oatmeal stout, okay, but definitely not the best out there."
Blue Point Oatmeal Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);it�s not overpowering but it is beery, and flavorful with a fuller mouth feel that is rich and smooth. wafting from a black lager to a lightly smokey and malty brew that has whatever you can imagine in the flavor profile as it really is not overdone in that aspect. tinge of hop.
Blue Point Oatmeal Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Bottle pour into nonic pint glass from Cigarette City. Appearance is virtually opaque--very dark brown with reddish hues with light source directly behind--no discernible sparkle, finger-width light brown head with poor retention and trace lacing. Aroma is roasted malts with chocolate, caramel, oatmeal. Taste is moderately strong roasted malts, hint of chocolate, light sour. Palate is light-to-medium bodied with thin, creamy texture but is overly carbonated--lively--with finish that is as taste. Overall, a nice enough brew and, though the taste may be a little thin, what really dings it is the palate is all wrong for a stout.
Blue Point Oatmeal Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Something must have been wrong with this bottle, so I�m gonna rate it as a Blueberry Oatmeal Sour, that�s how this brew tasted too me. A strong tartness, that was preceded by a blueberry/oatmeal concoction, a really nice complex flavor all this adds, even if it was unintentional.
Blue Point Oatmeal Stout;Patchogue, New York, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);From the 12 fl. oz. bottle dated 01/21/2016. It has an opaque, dark brown pour with a quick lasting off-white head. The aroma espouses a bit of chocolate, a bit of oatmeal but a low hop profile. If any. The body is on the thin side. The taste brings out the same chocolate and oatmeal notes with an okay milky sweetness. Finishes mostly clean. I know it was 90 degrees today so a Stout may seem out of season but it came in a mixed 12 pack.

Blue Point Hefeweizen;Patchogue, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Plastic sample cup at the brewery. Dark yellow to light orange color. Can see through the beer and vsisible carbonation. Nothing too discernable in the aroma. Present though, a humble earthy hefe. Taste I get banana but in a different manner than usual. I get a sweet aspect of banana only. A pretty full bodied hefe. But again not much too discernable in the taste either. Finishes with just a hint of bitterness. Average mouthfeel.
Blue Point Hefeweizen;Patchogue, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);"Tap at the brewery. Not many bad things to say about the beer, although it is not your ""typical"" hefeweizen. There is your malt and it is sweet with the slight presence of citrus (have not tried it with the lemon wedge). No banana flavor which I love, I am so sick of the banana craze."
Blue Point Hefeweizen;Patchogue, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);When I was at the brewery I spoke to Alan (the head brewer). They for the first time just tried a bit of a different recipe. It�s not what I expected from a hefe-weizen. It�s somewhat earthy, doesn�t have the refreshing aspect that hefe-weizens usually do. Has a grain bread heartyness, more hoppyness than hefe-weizens usually do, somewhat almondy dryness, different, not bad.
Blue Point Hefeweizen;Patchogue, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Tap at the brewery - quite full-bodied for a hefe - big time wheat malt presence in this one, and some light citrus and mild sweetness - quite hoppy for the style, making it seem like a hefe/pale ale hybrid - pretty nice.
Blue Point Hefeweizen;Patchogue, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);I got this one at State Line in Elkton, MD and it had a sweet wheat flavor and finish along with a thin head.

Nice gold/yellow color with nice haze to it. Good head retentiona dn lacing. Aroma is dominated by a banana estery fruitiness, and is backed by lots of wheat malt. Very smooth and refreshing. I tend to prefer banana weizens over the clove weizens. Great beer.
Blue Point Old Howling Bastard;Patchogue, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Aroma is caramel/toffee, malts and a hint of hops. The flavor is caramel/toffee, malts, mild fruit and a long mix of alcohol and liquor in the finish.

Blue Point Old Howling Bastard;Patchogue, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);From NOTES. A: Classic raisin/fig notes with a little chocolate milk and dried strawberries. Sounds odd, but they blend well and it�s actually a quite inviting smell. A: Reddish amber and cloudy, about one inch of head and good lacing. T: Very mild, almost watery, with subtle favors of caramel malt and bitter hops. Not much else, as all of the flavors really die on the finish and aftertaste. A little disappointing. P: Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. O: Decent, at best. Unremarkable.
Blue Point Old Howling Bastard;Patchogue, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);22 oz. bomber poured into a snifter. Beautiful red amber with a smallish head that fades to lacing pretty quickly. The beer clings to the glass very slightly when swirled. Not a strong aroma, really. I get some caramel and vanilla. Maybe some raisins. Perhaps more than anything I smell alcohol, though. Malty start with some sweet toffee. Not a lot of complexity in the taste, but nothing to complain about. The finish is a strong hop bitterness. It starts off quite thin for such a big beer and such a malt profile. As it warms, it gets a bit more syrupy. Decent carbonation. Nothing bad, just nothing of note. Indistinguishable malt flavors and some hop bitterness.

Amherst North Pleasant Pale Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Amherst Brewing Company;In short: A low intensity and clean pale ale that simply tastes �fresh�. Nice session beer. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear light golden body topped by a very small off-white head In long: Nose is lightly hoppy, a bit leafy, a bit citrusy. Taste has a solid crisp pale malt backbone with low sweetness sensation (dried baguette flavor) with soft notes of leafy and citrusy hops. Bitterness level is low for an american pale ale. Far from intense, this is not a tasty beer. But it is very pleasant to drink and just had that �freshness� taste that I only get from some brewpub beers. Nothing remarkable about here, but I could drink 6 pints of this beer in a row. The current rating average of this beer is 2.85!!??!! Absurdly underrated. But I respect other raters. My life motto is: Before I laugh at someone, I remind myself that I probably tapped the beat of a Limp Bizkit song at some point in my life.

A lovely floral/citrusy hop nose. Pale malts with a kiss of honey on the back. Good balance although it could certainly be a bit hoppier.

Clear golden colored beer, with a small white head and an aroma of dry yeast, lightly herbal hops and some grainy/lightly metallic malt. Flavor is rather unremarkable, this is no Anchor Steam, that�s for sure. I like the style, but this seems to just dumb it down to an unflavored, boring, nothingness. Drinkable, of course, but very uninspiring. Medium-light body, moderate to too much carbonation.
Amherst Salamander Crossing Steam Lager;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Amherst Brewing Company;Nice draught - mellow body, not too malt-heavy.

Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;Copper with a white head. Resiny, light on the palate. Run of the mill beer.
Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub - Amherst. Pours clear, deep gold with a small, white foam head. Somewhat shabby. A bit of astringent pine, hints of plastic, bread, leaves. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Sweet finish with orange rind, light pine, grass. Meh.
Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;Tap at pub. Light hazy orange, no head. Sweet, light citrus, honey. Very light in flavor and aroma. Passable, but barely.
Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Pours orange with a thin white head that leaves no lacing. Slight hint of pine on the nose. A bit of pine flavor on the tongue. Thin mouthfeel which finishes clean. Not as bold as I like to see from the style.
Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;Growler. Rating #40. Hazy dark copper pour with a small white head. Piney aroma, a little green as well, a green freshness. Above average bitterness, more pine with a light maltiness. Thanks to my growler swap sender. (2321)
Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;Appearance: hazy orange under a creamy off-white head, solid and smooth. Nose: cascade hops galore � pine trees and forests. Orange peel and grapefruit peel. Palate: cascade hops exude pine trees, pine needles, and general forestry in the back. Freshly cut green grass. Grapefruit peel. Pine needles. Dried rosemary. Bready in the middle with chewy grapefruit pulp mixed in. Final Thoughts: quite a tasty representation of the Cascade hop without slapping you in the face. A solid quaffer.
Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;In short: A basic moderately hoppy citrusy IPA How: Tap at brewpub The look: Clear golden body topped by a very small off-white head In long: The lightly hoppy nose is mostly cistrusy. Nice malt extraction with smooth round caramel with no white sugar sensation. Fresh citrus fruits. The bitterness level is medium and the beer is a bit dry in the finish. This was a decent IPA, the type of IPA that I would have found delicious 5 years ago. But with the multiplications of hops varieties and uber-hoppy kick-ass IPAs over the past 5 years, this beer is now just a decent IPA. Things have changed a lot in the past 5 years. Google and Apple are now evil monopoly empires and Microsoft is the cool underdog.
Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub. Appearance : Clear amber no head. Not much lacing. Aroma : Nice citrusy with hops and nice malt. Nice fresh hops. Not very hoppy but good. Taste : Resinous hops with malt and light caramel. Nice carbonation level. Overall : Very well done and rather drinkable. Nothing outstanding but a fairly good example of the style.
Amherst Cascade IPA;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Amherst Brewing Company;Sampled in a beer fest in chambly, another good example of the art of amherst brewing after the stout, this IPA was very good, nice cascade aroma and flavour, light in colour, the bitterness was present. This is a good example of an american IPA.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a hazy amber-brown color with a creamy looking head. Quick dissipation. Sly lace. The aroma had some spicy to earthy hops. A light tickle of tea and berry tones underneath and then some light biscuits. The flavor comprises of the same aromas, running spicy with a malty smooth semi-sweetness. Soft malty aftertaste with the spice barely there. Nice quick malty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Slight touch of carbonation. ABV felt appropriate by what the brewer suggests. Overall, nicely done ESB that I could have again.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Pours brown and leaves some lacing in the glass. Picking up a slight caramel note on the nose. Some maltiness on the tongue. Getting some dryness on the finish so there�s some hops in there somewhere. Admittedly this is not a fave style so this one�s not doing much for me.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;Very hazy amber-brown pour with a tight creamy head. The nose is lightly fruit with a bit of orange peel and a little bit of berry esters. There is a bit of spicy hoppiness in the nose as well. The flavour shows a soft spiciness and a lingering, fairly pronounced, resinous hoppiness. Bitterness is apparent as is a touch of dry-hopping. UK-type caramel malts although the base grain seems to be domestic two-row, to it�s detriment. It�s a nice and fairly authentic ESB, but it doesn�t come across as well as it might have, had it used Maris Otter as the base.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;The second of the beers I�ve had at the Amherst Brewery and this was just as good as the Cascade was. Deep amber color topped with a thick head which left lots of lace. Aroma was slightly hoppy and bitter. Flavor was nice with lots of hops with some fruit and bitter notes mixed in. Hoppy and bitter at the end. I would recommend trying out this and some of the other beers the Amherst Brewery has to offer.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;Pours a medium dark amber. I couldn�t get an aroma from the sampler glass that it was poured in. Malty and woodsy in the aroma. The bitterness is sharp and stands out in the taste. Expect a smooth yet lasting bitter finish.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;On-tap at the brewery. Good ESB, dry-hopped with Goulding. There is grapefruit taste here too. A minimal aroma and a small head. Noticeable hoppy, and certainly in the European style, more balanced than their other hoppy beers. A smooth drinker
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;Cold on tap: Pours a hazy medium amber color with a decent sized off-white head and plenty of lacing. Aroma is of rich malts, flowers, citrus and wood with fruit notes. Taste is of rich malts and flowery hops with notes of wood, fruit and caramel notes. Medium bodied, crisp and well carbonated. Ending has an elongated bitterness with notes of malt and caramel.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;sampled then had a full pint at the brewpub. Amber in color. Floral and grapefruit in the aroma as well as caramel malt. Taste is nice, with a good malt backbone. Alot of citrus and floral hops in the taste as well as tart fruit notes. Moderately bitter in the front, with a nice lingering bitterness in the finish. One of the best ESB�s I�ve ever had. Amherst definitely nailed this one.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;Numerous draughts between 2004-2006. This was routinely one of my favorite beers that ABC makes. A very aggressively hopped and full flavored ESB, this one could pack a punch without getting me too wasted. Even better on cask. Even though the beer wasn�t great, I miss ABC.
Amherst ESB;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Amherst Brewing Company;Poured a pretty amber color, some copper hues, the head was initially excellent with good retention. Lacing was fantastic, continuous foam coating the inside of the glass. Grapefruity aroma and flavor, noble hops in this ESB? This beer seemed like an IPA to me, and it was decent.

Amherst Raspberry Brown Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Amherst Brewing Company;What a great beer. This beer is dark amber and tastes amazing.

Amherst Raspberry Brown Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Amherst Brewing Company;sampled at the brewpub. brown in color. Aroma: rasberry and caramel malts. Taste is rasberry and caramel with notes of chocolate, rasberries throw off a bit of tartness and light funk. OK, drinkable.

Amherst Raspberry Brown Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Amherst Brewing Company;Nutty, raspberry nose. Ruddy brownish hue. Small light tan head. Sweet, faint funk, all raspberry, nutty, almost salty finish. It has some nice body, and the raspberry is refreshing, not overdone. Very drinkable, I think they should cask this one.
Amherst Raspberry Brown Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Amherst Brewing Company;A nice strong raspberry smell, that was good, although not overly beer like. Had a nice silky feel, but it was just too fruity for me to rate it too high. It could deffinately be passed off as a mixed drink, and a good one, but in good conscience I had to knock it down a notch for being too fruity.
Amherst Raspberry Brown Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Amherst Brewing Company;"Wow. A wonderful beer that is fruity yet enjoyable. I'd imagine this is the kind of beer that one must be ""in the mood for"""
Amherst Raspberry Brown Ale;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Amherst Brewing Company;Unlike most fruit beers that just piss me off, this tastes good. The taste isn't artificial and this would go down great on a hot summer day.
Amherst Massatucky Brown;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Amherst Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was more of an amber color with a slight transparency about it. Little white foamy head fell off at a decent pace. Not much lace, somewhat stringy and sliding into the beer. The aroma had some earth, grass, bread and cocoa powder. The flavor was basically the same - somewhat sweet with a decent dryness to it. Light toast-like aftertaste and finish. The feel was about light bodied with a pretty good sessionable sort of feel about it. Sturdy carbonation and the ABV felt right. Overall, good brown ale worthy of coming back to.
Amherst Massatucky Brown;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Amherst Brewing Company;"Dark amber brown thin lacy beige head; aroma is sweet malty slight hint of caramel; flava is malty grainy touch of berry; feels light with moderate fizz; finishes roasty malty grainy"

Amherst Massatucky Brown;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Amherst Brewing Company;Reddish copper, you know the deal. Sweet, red fruity nose, light roast. Flavor is lightly smokey, some peat, light roasted malts. Probably the best of the Amherst brews I tried this time.
Amherst Massatucky Brown;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Amherst Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Pours brown with a nutty caramel quality on the nose. Lots of caramel notes on the tongue with some hop balance. Finishes clean. Nice example of style.
Amherst Massatucky Brown;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Amherst Brewing Company;Appearance: pumpernickel bread with no haze and mahogany hints along the edge. Nose: chocolate front and center � chocolate cake, bars, and malted milk chocolate. Godiva hot chocolate. Chocolate wafers. Chocolate covered walnuts for some dry crunch. Palate: chocolate shines but never overwhelms � good balance. Hint of burnt dark fruits, grapes and plums specifically, in the back with stones and seeds included. Chocolate and walnuts mingle. Something indiscernible in the back. Final Thoughts: never could lay my tastebuds on that final flavor at the back of each quaff. Overall though quite the tasty sessionable brown ale. I�d drink it again.
Amherst Massatucky Brown;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Brown Ale;Amherst Brewing Company;Growler, thanks to LuckyDog. Nice malty aroma with roast and light cocoa. Mouthy, lightly sweet, slightly roasted, the bitterness is light and it would be better characterized as tangy. Toast/roast finish. Pretty drinkable.

Amherst Half In The Bagpipe;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Amherst Brewing Company;On tap at brewery. Pours a dark mahogany amber with a moderate beige head. Aroma is toffee, yeast, and fruit. Taste is nutmeg, yeast, bread, some grain, and sweet but slightly metallic toffee. Light-medium body. Moderate carbonation. Somewhat oily mouthfeel.
Amherst Half In The Bagpipe;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Amherst Brewing Company;On tap over at ABC. Has a nice sweet caramel flavor and scent. Unfortunately the aftertaste is very short lived. Probably the best brew over at Amherst Brewery.
Amherst Half In The Bagpipe;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Amherst Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: Blackberries and blueberries emanate from the caramel maltiness, forming a silky body for this relatively drinkable Scotch Ale. Its finish is rather forgettable, which is a shame, but its drinkability is increased. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam surrounds the darkest brown. -The body is round but never heavy, increasing drinkability. -Carbonation is prickly, not exactly helping us enjoy the malty festivities to their fullest. -There is not enough caramelization for my tastes in the style, but there is a nice flavor deployment anyway. -This is definitely one of their best offerings. On tap at the brewpub.
Amherst Half In The Bagpipe;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Amherst Brewing Company;"Draught pint at the brewpub, October 14 2007. Very dark, opaque brown with just a bit of lasting head and a touch of lacing....big caramel-sweet aroma, a hint of earthy-smoky malts shows up as it warms, but it�s fairly simple on the whole....quite rich on the tongue, malty-sweet and thick, minimally smoky-peaty, with a faint but growing alcoholic bite.....body is quite creamy and luscious....a real pleasure to drink, at least in a single pint, but not a lot to take home afterwards; pretty simple."
Amherst Half In The Bagpipe;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Amherst Brewing Company;Keg at the brewpub. Vintage, from last year. Hazy orange, off white head. Malty aged aroma, and fruity. Same goes for the flavor, malty and very fruity. This has aged well enough. Very drinkable, and not too heavy.
Amherst Half In The Bagpipe;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Amherst Brewing Company;2003 vintage, served on tap 2/19/05 with Mkobes and Maibockaddict. Light brown-caramel colored body, with some light auburn hues and a moderate amount of caramel colored head. Aroma has some light hops notes, but mainly molasses, caramel and light yeast. Flavor is not highly sweet, yet it showcases a moderately dry malting, with light caramel/toffee/molasses notes. The hops do come out on the finish, and I must add, they do a very good job with the hopping here at Amherst. Light earthiness and graininess of body, but otherwise a medium amount of flavor. Moderate carbonation, very even, mellow beer. Has aged well and Amherst should be proud of this one. A bit light of body and flavor, though, in the end.
Amherst Half In The Bagpipe;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Amherst Brewing Company;Very nice Scotch Ale... even better when it�s been aged for a year. Packs a punch, but it�s nicely hidden by its malt flavor, yet well balanced with hops (not sure what kind). Good beer from a good small brewery.

Pours dark brown and leaves no lacing. Taste is muted. Slight notes of roasted malt. Thin mouthfeel. Clean finisher. Nope!
Amherst Two Sisters Imperial Stout;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Amherst Brewing Company;Dark black pour (although not pitch black). Aroma shows a bit of black licorice and a touch of charred malts as well. There is a soft spiciness on the back of the palate. Fairly peppery with a bit of ethanol apparent in the mouth. Light roasty astringency and some surprisingly subtle aromatics. It�s quite the wimpy impy.
Amherst Two Sisters Imperial Stout;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Amherst Brewing Company;I expected more. First off this is not an Imperial Stout. It�s rather weak compared to others. The flavor was weak and nothing special, the thick texture is what saved it for me. The aroma wasn�t too great either. It reminded me of dirty pennies...gross.
Amherst Two Sisters Imperial Stout;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Amherst Brewing Company;On tap. Chocolate notes, pretty good beer. Good flavor, but felt a little thin for an imperial.
Amherst Two Sisters Imperial Stout;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Amherst Brewing Company;Coffee aroma. Really bold rich coffee,taste on tap at the brewpub.

Pours really really dark brown with a thin brown head that leaves some lacing. Nice smoked roasted notes on the nose. Also some chocolate notes on the tongue. Thin mouthfeel leads to a clean finish. Decent choice for a session beer.
Amherst Puffer's Smoked Porter;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Amherst Brewing Company;In short: A watery roasted dark ale with faint smoke. Boring. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Almost black body topped by a small tan head In long: Nose is lightly smoked with light notes of roast. Body is way too thin, borderline watery. Taste is burnt black cake, a bit of caramel, roast, light notes of smoke. To call this smooth would be an understatement. Its taste is bland and the beer lacks body but it wasn�t unpleasant in any way. Boring and without personality. If the smoke beers were college students, the Amherst Puffers Smoked Porter would be the dude playing flute in the football marching band.

Amherst Puffer's Smoked Porter;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Amherst Brewing Company;Deep brown beer with a thin white head. Fairly creamy appearance. The nose is loaded with soft sweet cocoa and a touch of light beechwood smoke as well. There is a little bit of light brown malt/crystal sweetness on the nose. The palate is substantially thinner than the beer needs to be. A bit of roast but it comes across a bit ashy because of the thinness of the body. It�s also got some clean bitterness that seems a bit inappropriate. It isn�t bad by any means, but it could be much better.
Amherst Puffer's Smoked Porter;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Smoked;Amherst Brewing Company;Cold on tap: Pours a dark brown color with a medium creamy light tan head.

The lacing was decent on the way down and the aroma very mocha-like with a charcoal smokey touch. Flavor was much the same with some roasted malts showing up behind the smoke flavor.

Heartland Old Red Nose Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Greenpoint Beer Works;Some chestnut, cinnamon and spices are in there with a decent malt body to envelop it but still a bit too watery for me. If you are a malt head this one might be for you though.

Arrogant Double Bastard Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Arrogant Consortia;Tasted this at Six Degrees North, Glasgow on the 1st February 2019. Keg dispense, 1/3 pint sampled. Clear garnet in colour with a thin pale buff head. Strong malty aroma with raw Bourbon alcohol burning on the nose. Thin oily mouthfeel and poor lacing. Mixed malt provides Christmas pudding base with sweet caramel, syrupy stewed prunes and dates with notes of blood orange. Difficult to detect powerful hop resins but light orange citrus flavour imparts short bitter intensity. Finish is malty with dry Bourbon burn from the lengthy booze notes, hints of vanilla oak cask and massive prune fruit still driving through. Lethal and proud of it.

Rocky River Monkey Paw;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub.5 grains whatever they may be. 37 IBU. Malty aroma with a good head, hoppy taste. Good balance of hop and malt, lending it very good drinkability. Wonderful spider lace from he white head. Creamy palate.
Rocky River Monkey Paw;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);"Large draught sample at the brewpub, June 26 2007. Lots of thick lacing and a nice lasting off-white covering topping the translucent maple body....quite hoppy, resinous aroma with just a hint of roasted/baked nuts....very dry, malts are too subdued, thin and bitter -- somewhat rancid nutty character....carbonation a bit too strong; very ordinary."
Rocky River Monkey Paw;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Draft at the brewpub. Aroma: Medium sweet maltiness with notes of caramel, toasted walnuts, and light breadiness. Surprisingly high level of hop aroma leaning towards the earthy and resiny. Appearance: Dark reddish brown in color and clear. Light khaki head was full and frothy with good retention. Fair lacing. Flavor: Slightly sweet bready maltiness with a caramel, molasses, and toasted nuts. Hops come on strong with pine, resin, and earthy notes shining through. Surprisingly bitter. Palate: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Overall: Wasn�t expecting the hop levels in this one. Reminded me a bit of Surly Bender (that�s a good thing). Nice one.
Rocky River Monkey Paw;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);"The claim: ""very little hop presence"" The facts: Quit a bit of hop presence. Too much really, for a brown ale (at least I think and I think what I think might matter here, being that I�m the one reviewing this). That�s not to say it wasn�t good, but the American hops reoriented my focus to a place where I found myself stuck. Went awfully well with my burger and fries, though."
Rocky River Monkey Paw;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap @ the brewpub: Reddish brown pour with an off white head. Aroma, caramel, some molasses, and some earthy hops. Flavor, soft thick mouthfeel, hoppy and nutty, some earthy bitterness. Good stuff.
Rocky River Monkey Paw;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Full bodied and smooth. Suprisingly bitter. Nice rich malt with a bit of smoke on the finish. Very nice.
Rocky River Monkey Paw;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Has a somewhat smokey, leafy nose to it. Otherwise the mouthfell is smooth with a little tingling bitterness is the end.
Rocky River Monkey Paw;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Is this nitro foam? Smooth creamy with an oddly complex bitter with floral components. Well balanced with a soft, bodydelicious, bite. Matt Cole, the head brewer, is creative and in my humble opinion the best brewer in Cleveland.
Rocky River Dusseldorfer Alt;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Unfinished and unfiltered - a special brewer's treat. Creamy feel but clean, some hints of alcohol spice as well as a surprising hop-mediated tang. I'm looking for a bit more bitter for this style but this is not at all a bad brew.

Rocky River Santas Little Helper Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Very decent thirst quencher and a nice balance on the APA style. Grapefruit at the end with maltiness at the start just like the label says. Good beer.
Rocky River Santas Little Helper Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);tap at rrbc. pours a clear copper with a beige head. big notes of cinnamon, nutmeg spices. the cinnamon, nutmeg, orangepeel, corriandor spice mix really stand out in this. mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it is nice to see the malts not over power this, and rather, let the nice christmas season spices be prominently displayed. nice.
Rocky River Santas Little Helper Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Not bad. The average spiced Christmas ale style beer (slightly spicy, palatable to the swill drinking public). Pours amber. Smells of bubblegum, spice and, malt. Tastes pretty good, some ginger, nutmeg and, clove are pretty nice. The finish seems a bit off, I feel like I�ve been chewing on ground cloves, it�s not bad but it is a little bit awkward.
Rocky River Santas Little Helper Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap, pours a reddish amber with a thick off white head. Aromas of ginger, malt, honey. Nice spicy flavor, the ginger and clove really shine through. A good sweetness, but a little thin. The coriander and orange get lost in the complexity. Still a pretty good seasonal offering.
Rocky River Santas Little Helper Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On draft at the brewpub, dark amber orangish color, nice aroma of spice, similar flavor profile to Great Lakes, probably a little more ginger or nutmeg spice flavor though. Good holiday spice brew
Rocky River Santas Little Helper Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Bright amber pour. Usual array of Xmas spices, but none too overwhelmng. Ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and maybe some orange peel. Somewhat lighter in body than mose other Rocky River beers, and I�d be willing to wager it was due to the honey. Toasted maIts and a touch of carmel meet with the spices and balance out well. I found this to be a little crisper than most other Xmas/winter warmer style beers, too. Which was a good thing to me, for I can drink more than just a short glass. 05 has been my favorite version of this beer to date.
Rocky River Santas Little Helper Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);22 oz bomber bought @ Rocky River. Medium off white head is sort of short lived over a lightly hazy deep amber coppery brown body. Spicy aroma with nutmeg in the forefront followed by ginger and a little cinnamon and orange peel. Ginger & nutmeg switch places as it warms. A lightly toasted malt with caramel and some hints of roastiness. A bit of piney alcohol aroma, but spices drown out fruitiness if it�s there. Fairly well balanced at the start, but turns bitter into the finish & aftertaste. There seems to be a floral, fruity alcohol flavor with a very low caramel malt character. Some spicy hop flavor mid palate into the drier finish. Aftertaste is lasting and hoppy. The only spice really discernable in the flavor is ginger. Malt flavor is really sort of flat in this one. Medium body, low carbonation, dry (borderline astringent) mouthfeel. A little warmth from alcohol, but not much. This is not something I�d particularly like to drink a lot of. Not enough malt character to balance bitterness in flavor, or spice in the aroma.
Rocky River Santas Little Helper Christmas Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);I had this at the brewpub but it was just called the Christmas Ale. Red-orange color with a thin, lasting head. Enticing ginger nose. Nice warm spiciness of ginger, clove and orange. It was maybe a little thin with a faint metallic finish. Nice beer anyway.

Rocky River Hilter Kilter Scottish Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Rocky River Brewing Co.

Lightly effervescence. Lacks strength.
Wachusett IPA;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Wachusett Brewing Company;From Jul 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with DLucky. Thanks Dan! It pours a clear orange gold with a 1 finger head of foam that shrinks quickly to just a ring around the glass. Lacing is close to nonexistant. The smell is both hoppy and malty. Good citrus notes with some orange and lemon, and a caramel malt nose that also brings some candy sugar-like sweetness. The taste is of grapefruit and lemon that packs some good bitterness and a bready malt base that's backed up by caramel malt sweetness. The finish is slightly bitter in this light bodied IPA and there's little to no aftertaste. Overall, I think this is a pretty good example of the style. It just lacks a bit of assertiveness with the flavours, imho.

Wachusett IPA;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Wachusett Brewing Company;Bottle at the Bartinis. Pours clear, deep gold with a white foam head. Basic toasty malts, old pine, orange rind. Moderately sweet, some earthy bitterness. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Finishes with toasty and grainy malts, earth, leaves, orange peel. This is what people were talking about 10 years ago when they used the term �East Coast IPA�.
Wachusett IPA;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Wachusett Brewing Company;APPEARANCE - looks good. Golden color with light head. NOSE - smells a bit of floral notes, and a bit of earthy ones to balance. FLAVOR - strong presence of earthy hop, and unbalanced bitterness ? particularly when warm. It?s a lot like an overly hopped lager. NOTES - the beer presents well, and smells good, but the flavor is where it takes the off-ramp.
Wachusett IPA;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Wachusett Brewing Company;Pours cloudy golden with two fingers of white head. Aroma of pine, citrus, mango, light peach. Taste is mild citrus bitter with lingering resin. Body is very light but smooth with soft to average carbonation.

Wachusett IPA;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Wachusett Brewing Company;Can. Surprisingly robust aroma and flavor from a can. Strong hoppy IPA flavors, slightly bitter finish. Very drinkable.
Wachusett IPA;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Wachusett Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This one was poured into a pint glass every time. The appearance was a nice looking hazy yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipates at a nice pace and ends up leaving some nice slightly foamy lacing. The smell was completely floral but did allow a decent citrus back up. Don�t count on any sweet malts trying to show up, damn, this stuff is powerful. The taste was florally and citrusy sweet. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium and showed a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation had the right amount of sharpness for an AIPA. Overall, no complaints from me as this was a really nice AIPA well worthy of having again.
Riverside Honey Lager;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);Sweet, prickly, sugary flavors, honey definitely springs forward. Reminds me of an English shandy (beer and sprite). Light bitterness in the finish, but overall lingering lemony sweetness. Pretty light in color and moderate carbonation. Definitely one for the ladies.

Deep copper, nice tight beige head, fairly persistent. Fairly pleasant malty taste. Pleasant woodiness,dry,a little nut-papery. Touch of marmite in there, but nice toffee aspects too. All in all not saying wow, just decent, but when I consider the alcohol percentage, this covers the alcohol very well. I raced down the glass, it�s a very easy tasty barleywine. Like the Celt, there�s something so full and drinkable about this. Best beer of the evening so far. Haharr, me hearties, this�un�s a good�un.

Drakes Jolly Rodger (-2004);San Leandro, California, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Drakes Brewing Company;This tasted like more of an American Barley Wine than a Scotch Ale to me.

Beermanns Bourbon Barrel Barleywine;Lincoln, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;I think I first had the Beermanns Barleywine in 2003 or 2004. I�m pretty sure because I still have a bottle of the �05 in my cellar. I loved this beer when I first tried it. Warm and delicious with a great mouth feel. I tried the 2009 vintage on tap at the brewery last week and was really disappointed. My notes (for the �09): Thin, brown color and not much head. Sweet nose. Taste is sweet but thin. I held my second sip in my mouth and got medium-high hop bitterness and alcohol. Just opened my 2005 (Bottle # 296) on 7/13/09. I think it has passed its prime. It was pretty effervescent when I opened the bottle, which had been resting upright for years in a 54 degree cellar. Upon opening the flip top, beer gushed all over the place. In a panic, I sipped the foam as it came out of top and it was delicious -- big bourbon flavor. In the glass, though, it�s totally different. Cloudy copper color in the glass with a thick tan head. Excellent lacing. Nose is sour. If I didn�t know better, I would swear that this had Brett yeast in it. Reminds me of the Deschutes Dissident more than the warm, savory barleywine I put into my cellar. I do start to get more bourbon flavor as the beer opens up in the glass. I regret that I let this beer age too long but am glad I got to have it several times while it was around.
Beermanns Bourbon Barrel Barleywine;Lincoln, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;Bottle at the Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens on 08/03/2008 on day three of RBSG 2008.

Beermanns Bourbon Barrel Barleywine;Lincoln, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Beermanns Beerwerks Brewery;"""2007 #119 BN MS Tvs AA"" hand-written on 33.8 -ounce bottle. A tasty barleywine that is on par, or perhaps slightly above average. The aroma is outstanding, suggesting that you�re in for something very special, yet you get something just plain good. Sweet, not too sweet, and quite coconutty, which I�ve never tasted before in a barleywine. The bourban barrel is evident, but not overwhelming. In conclusion, it is a very good drink that is worth a try by all beer enthusiasts, and I myself would like to try other vintages or batches. Recommended overall."

Rocky River Tomahawk Pale Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Clear auburn. Simply amazing head, stayed creamy and firm 45 minutes later. Malty, some good caramel, then big drying hops. Vaguely scotchy, has some good depth.

Rocky River Chocosaurus;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);pub 11/20/05 Very similar to the Oompa. Chocolatey nose with more coffee/roasted malt than Oompa. Slick body. Nice balance between chewy chocolate and dry roasted malts. Intresting touch of hop in there too.
Rocky River Chocosaurus;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Way too sweet. I was unaware of that cavity until this sweet watery chocolatey drink hit my tooth. Starts with big real chocolate bar flavor, and in less than 6 ounces, turns into bad fake chocolate Necco flavor. Like mixing your watery ale with Ovaltine.
Rocky River Chocosaurus;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Chocolate pudding aroma, tastes like a gourmet devil's food cake but in a liquid, bittery form. Got some buttery flavor too. Agree with jaymobrown, its very sweet and was somewhat flat at the RAF. I'd like to have this beer about twice a year I think, anymore would just make the novelty disappear.
Rocky River Chocosaurus;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Cask, RAF '03. For some reason this beer really impresses me.

None of the off flavors User X described.

Great Lakes Honey Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"Had at GLB....Poured into a 5 oz. sample glass, Clear Yellow, very thin line of lace. Not a good start. Aroma was mellow, sweet, very light hop notes. Taste was nice and smooth, I cant taste honey, but I can tell the honey is in there doing it�s job. Did I mention smooth. Mild hop is present. I wanted to order a whole glass of this, but I had the ""11 beer sampler"" and that was enough....And at 8% abv. this could be dangerous."
Great Lakes Honey Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"Glass from a growler courtesy of a traveling friend. This brew pours a mostly clear pale golden color with a medium and foamy white head that recedes steadily. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. Mildly spiced hops aroma with sweet honey in the background. Light-bodied and efferevescent with flavors of sweet malt and honey and a moderately bitter hops overtone. The finish is sweet molasses and honey and short. Average overall, though I suspect that if they threw the word ""Imperial"" in the name considering the ABV it would be better received."

Great Lakes Honey Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at the brew pub. Pale yellow with a small head. Not much aroma. Flavor is hoppy, with a bit of honey sweetness. But, the honey flavor is very faint and without the name, you�d be hard placed not figure out it was honey.
Great Lakes Honey Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Clear golden pour, big frothy white head with lots of lacing. Caramel malts, almost butter like sweetness, honey is there but it would be a light honey cloying sweetness, floral hops in the finish and a dry aftertaste. I liked that it wasn�t very sweet or weak.

Great Lakes Honey Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Light gold. Sweet, honey is light and floral in the nose. Honey is largely missing from the flavor, oddly dry and bitter. Very hoppy as well, just an odd mix.
Great Lakes Honey Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Nice color and clarity, but way too much honey. My least favorite of the great lakes. Weird.
Great Lakes Honey Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"on tap, at the brewery - 6/1/02. medium thin body. Honey sweetness was not as evident as I thought it would be (that's fine). long thin hoppy finish clears out the sweetness pretty quickly. Kind of odd - usually the ""honeys"" aren't so hoppy."

Great Lakes Prohibition Pils;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at the down town brewery. I had this after a farily long walk on hot day... That will enhance the taste of all pilseners. Served in tall pilsner glass, the color was of light bright yellow. The carbonation caused a few bubbbles to start at the bottom and sour to the top of the glass, not too many though. There was no head on the beer when I received it. The flavor was a great blend of hops and malt. The hops were subtle with a grassy character, and the malts were light. The beer over all was light, crips and clean....But not watery. A very good pilsner.

Big 22 ounce glass served too cold, but I let it sit and warm up enough. Mild aroma of caramel and bread followed by some tame hops. The hops are crossed between tame citrus and grassy noble types. Clear copper color with a small white head and a few spots of lacing. Tame ale, hops are in there but lean toward a grassy noble presence. A taste of calm citrus and bread.

Cleveland ChopHouse American Pale Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);Sit down (you probably are sitting). Close your eyes. Imagine what an American pale ale tastes like. Now go to the Cleveland Chophouse and taste their pale ale. You might be shocked at how close this beer comes.

Cleveland ChopHouse Light Lager;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);I�ve had worse light lagers, but why would a brewpub feel the need to emulate them?

Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);Ummm, if you aren�t a multi-national beer corp based in Ireland, there is no reason to destroy your stout by shoving it full of nitro.

Cleveland ChopHouse Irish Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;ChopHouse & Brewery Cleveland (Craftworks);"Draft: Opaque brown w/ a beige lasting head. Nice mellow roasty coffee aroma w/ hints of chocolate, very little fruitiness and no diacetyl. Very little coffelike flavor for a dry stout, well balanced. Also very little roasted bitterness. Little fruitiness; has a roasty finish and aftertaste and a very light acidity from dark grains. Very smooth m/f, creamy w/ low carbonation and a lighter body. Again, probably a beer that was made to not scare people away. Would be a good starter ""dark"" beer for people that ""don�t like dark beers""."

Pittsburgh Sterling;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Can dumped into a goblet. Yellow-orange body, fizzy white head. Lots of carbonation. Cornflakes and light barley sweetness in the aroma. Corn and toasted malt flavor with some stale lager hops balancing things out. Soapy finish. Thanks John!
Pittsburgh Sterling;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Saw this in a gas station cheaper than any other 6 pack they had there so I had to get it. Its on par with PBR or stag. Yellow,fizzy and corny. It is what it is and it is cheap.
Pittsburgh Sterling;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;I have passed by this many times at the large local retail grocery market. Its place on the shelf, its appearance and price often were a deterrent to me grabbing the 12 pack and high tailing it to the check out. But today is the day. I am eyed up by the checker and promptly asked for an ID, obviously the quality and sophistication of this brew required an advanced age to enjoy and therefore the check, or maybe she was seeing at what age senility may actually start showing signs. After reading the last review I now know that I am in for a real treat worthy of the milestone so many have asked about. A well crafted beer in a can you say. Beer in the washing machine? How much better can beer get? Well this obviously is the beer that will conclude my journey and quest to find great beer. I am suddenly saddened with the realization that the past years have been wasted, when I could have just reached up and grabbed this 12 pack so much sooner. Time and money wasted. Hours wasted driving to pubs and breweries. Having to sit with other raters just to sample a bottle that was hand delivered and signed by the brewer. Oh the humanity. No longer must I browse this site in search of that better beer. I shall be liberated! I thirst and a product of high esteem has been poured to slake my thirst. A light golden product, with a diminished white head presides in my pilsner glass. I am starting to feel the euphoria subside. For the appearance does not satisfy me. The aroma yields scents of roasted corn, resin and rubber. My hopes of freedom continue to slide. A light flowery sweetness hits the tongue and parades about. Light grain and perhaps a touch of malt also seem to be in the mix. I feel the manacles of malt clasp more tightly then ever. Rather dry and uneventful finish and linger. Some dish soap flavors come in as it warms. Rats, I am stunned, for this is not the nirvana I was hoping for. I have 10 cans left (why ten, because It took two cans to finish this review) and this is not the product that will end my search and my dipsomania. I am once again a slave to this folly. The search shall continue. And tomorrow is another day
Pittsburgh Sterling;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;I understand there is some rampant beer snobbery on this site, which is fine. But back to the basics beer is also an appealing alternative to other more expensive, albeit well-crafted beers. If you think beer oughta come in a can or you like the idea of a washing machine full of ice and beer, there is really no finer beer availiable. Crisp, refreshing and eminantly drinkable this beer will satisfy you on all counts. This beer is actually originally from PA, but the original brewery (whose name I forget) was closed in 1927 due to Prohibition. Afterwards it was bought by a company in Evansville, IN where it grew popular around these parts. Now it�s brewed in Pittsburgh by ADN (although this site says differently.) Still readily availiable here, although it�s not exactly ubiquitous. Chalk drinking this up to hometown pride. Like drinkg Falls City Beer, which is also brewed in PA these days.
Pittsburgh Sterling;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Damn glad i got a chance to swill on this one before it goes out of production. This was a fine beer to drink while swillin back a few dozen at the farm. I can dig it, it has character.
Jurupa Honey Lager;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jurupa Valley Brewing Company;Cloudy honey with a thin white head. Aroma of toasted corn and lemon peel? Crisp and clean and yuck! a strikingly invasive lemon peel twang, atop the light honey flavor. Cloying and thick like a liquid cough drop. Did make my throat feel better but what the hell are these people thinking?
Jurupa Honey Lager;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jurupa Valley Brewing Company;What!!!!! Egats!!!! Are you kidding?? This is sour laden crap. Words of Wisdom: do not even think about joining Michael Jackson's brewpub club. Too bad critics, this beer was fresh as can be. If you like this beer, well......
Jurupa Honey Lager;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jurupa Valley Brewing Company;Gold in color, large white head and fair lace. Nose is malty, and sweet. Start is malt and honey sweet, the middle thin and mild, a touch of hops at the finish, another loser from Jurupa and Michael jackson Brew pub tour, if you though about joining save your money and talk to the folks at Beer On The Wall.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;Pours a murky dark amber color. HUGE head. Aroma of coriander, nutmeg, clove and earthy yeast. Flavor is smooth caramel and spice.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;This beer pours a dark brownish-amber color with a somewhat fizzy medium beige head that evaporates to an outer ring eventually. Large sticky patches of lacing. Aroma of sweet spices and fruit. Light body with flavors of cloves, yeast, fruit and malt. The finish is sweetly spiced with a banana aftertaste. Above average brew overall.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;Bottle shared by Dogbrick. Clear copper pour with a thin beige head. Nose of banana, spice and some funky tartness. Flavor is bananas and cinnamon with some sugary sweetness and a slight touch of funk before a semi-sweet finish.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;750 bottle. Nose is super-brett. brown with a thick white head. Taste is really funkhouse, bretty, no alcohol presence. Thins out as it warms. A bit of a one-way beer here. OK.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;750 ml bottle from Wine and Cheese Place in Clayton. The bottle also said this was part of their Farmhouse series and is a Belgian Dubbel. Pours a cloudy brown color with a small tan head. Aroma of anise, clove, vanilla, Belgian yeast, malts, caramel, and winter spices. The flavor follows suit really well, with more malts and caramel sweetness, but not as much spiciness. Medium bodied, with subtle carbonation and a smooth, syrupy mouthfeel. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Re-Rate: New recipe tried from the growlers Shawn brought to iTap-Soulard on 3/18/11: Very fruity- lots of banana, fig, anise. Also notes of caramel, bread, and butterscotch. Spicy, fruity, and malty, with a good medium body. Really nice.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;Lightly hazed copper colored brew. Smaller khaki colored head. Subtle, mild aromas make on work for this one. Light caramel and pale malt mix with a touch of cloves and banana. A very light dunkleweizen scent. Flavors of light brown sugar mingle with dry spices of cloves and ginger. Some light fruit salad joins the fray with some grapes, bananas and pears. Flavors light the aromas are mellow and subdued. Some DMS comes in as this warms and some fermentation faults seem to be evident. A mix of a dunleweizen and belgian amber. No major flaws, but enough small ones to drop this down. One of the best things about this one is that it has a long malty linger, with lightly toasted malt with a mild berry side.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;"22oz. bottle, 2006 vintage (""Artist Series""). Sweet, sugary, spicy aroma, some cinnamon and orange along with a a certain herbal, tea-like aspect, perhaps some faint licorice and further hop citrus in the background. Largely opaque garnet color, the head and lacing almost entirely absent after a short while. Flavor is sweet, spicy, seemingly full of yeast and with a tinge of mild bitterness, combined with more herbal and lightly citric hop tones, also a certain fruitiness, lightly berryish and almost candyish in some ways. Perhaps a trace of alcohol very late. Fairly smooth and sticky on the palate with a medium-full body. A bit muddled I suppose, but mildly interesting in its way."
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;From a bomber purchased at Lukas Liquors in KC. The body is opaque copper with a light khaki head. Non-alcoholic apple cider domniates the smell. There is a hint of ginger spice. The taste has some strange mixes occuring. There is a little bit of apple and cinnamon. However, you also get some notes of carrots and romaine lettuce behind that. A confusing beer, but it is ok.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;From a 22 oz. bomber with no freshness date, sampled at cellar temperature in a chalice, part of the Artist Series, purchased at Lukas in Ellisvile, MO. Poured a cloudy reddish amber with a small foamy off-white head that quickly settled in a thin tiny bubbly lacing, very, very minimal amount of sticking. Aromas of sweet oranges, pineapple, sweet spices, light clove, and grain bready at the edges. Moderate carbonation and a softly crisp, dryish, thin, watery light bodied mouthfeel, too much of a watery light bodied feel for my tastes. Thin malts and watery tasting, orange zest and pineapple juice, cinnamon, clove, nutty, a watery tea-like flavor (the hops?), thin, watery grainy malts with a touch of toffee, once again, a watered down alcohol taste towards the end, and a dryish, thin, watery malt finish. Having been to the brewery/brewpub and Square One, this was a major disappointment, too low in carbonation, thin and watery are a common theme with me, unless I hear about an improvement, I won�t be trying this again.
Augusta Winter Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Augusta Brewing Company;Seriously now, if you�re only going to bottle one beer why not make it a good beer. This is quite crap. Poured from a bomber dark hazy orange / copper with a quickly disappering tan head. The aroma has musty malt, light spice and root beer. Mouthfeel is thin and watery with minimal carbonation. Taste starts like overbrewed tea and and sassaphras - very astringent. The finish is fairly spicy with notes of cinnamon. This is mediocre at best.

Portsmouth 70 Shilling;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scottish Ale;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours brilliant rosy amber with thin white head. The aroma starts with a pulse of cherry fruitiness quickly followed by a mix of roasty � nutty � earthiness. The taste begins with solid roasted malts leading into cherry and plums and then more cherry hard candy. It heads toward the finish with moderate fruitiness mixing with roastiness and nuttiness and crystal malt goodness and a mild background of earthiness. Very nice.

Portsmouth 70 Shilling;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scottish Ale;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours a deep amber color. Aroma is maple, malt, wood, smoke, and vanilla. Flavor is sweet licorice with smoked malt. Finish is lingering candy sugar with a lively carbonation. Solid beer.
Portsmouth 70 Shilling;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scottish Ale;Portsmouth Brewery;"Well, despite this beer showing ""retired"" and having no reviews since 2004, my bottle clearly reads ""70 Shilling Scotch Ale"" so I�ll stick my review here. Pours a deep, deep copper with a small bubbly tan head that dissipates quickly to a collar leaving sporadic lacing. Aroma is dominated by sweetness with caramel malts, toffee and dark fruits, but there is a hint of citrus hops in the nose as well. The taste is a more toasted version of the smell with big sweet caramel malts and dark fruits playing big roles. Again, there is a slight hop presence in the background but not enough to leave more than a passing bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation that tickles the tongue with the sweetness that dominates the taste. This is a very good scotch ale and one that I would seek out."
Portsmouth 70 Shilling;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Scottish Ale;Portsmouth Brewery;Art of Beer Festival 2004: Has a clouded amber color with a small tan head. Smell is of sweet malts. Taste is also malted and finishes sweet. Overall a pretty good beer.

Fredericksburg Peace Pipe Pale Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;This was weak for the style.

Grain Belt Premium Light;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;12oz bottle purchased by the dad during family reunion. Classing it up by pouring into a glass but you can clearly tell this is a straw golden color. Basically clear without any sort of attempt at creating a visual of flavor. Nose isn�t all too pleasant with a grassy and grainy quality that leaves me disappointed. This has an odd grain sweetness and some mild grassy notes but let�s be honest flavor isn�t really the primary goal of this beer. This serves as a reminder that beer isn�t always about flavor or alcohol content or complexity. Sometimes it�s about sharing a few beers with family and talking about old times. Thanks Grain Belt.
Grain Belt Premium Light;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Grain Belt Premium Light has a thin, white head, a clear, fairly bubbly, straw appearance, and minimal lacing left behind.

Pale straw colored beer with a short lived white head. Lots of skunk and sulfur. Sweet corn and grain. A bit of seltzer, too. Really bland flavor other than the skunk. A sweet sulfur, corn, and grain profile. Lots of seltzer and a touch of grass and soap bitterness.
Grain Belt Premium Light;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Shared at RBSG 2014 in the Presidential Suite. Moderately skunky and a very strong off-putting corn character in the nose. The flavor kind of smooths it out a bit, but still there in a detracting, unpleasant way. Not the worst, but far from the best.
Grain Belt Premium Light;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;This is an incredibly light beer, I wil say that much. It is pale and clear and has just a hint of crackery malt and lemon hops. I prefer my American lagers more for flavored but this isn�t bad.

City Winter Porter;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);the flavor is licorice and roots in earth. the beer looks good in the glass with a big light brown head. the palate seems a little too thin and light as well as weak for the flavor. this seems odd due to the vibrant and enthusiastic head. touch of soy malt indicates a muted saltiness. a bit of a medicine smell at the end which at the start seemed a good aroma and precurser to something interesting.
City Winter Porter;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);12 oz bottle from variety pack. Very watered down. no taste what so ever. will NOT buy again.

Sweet and roasty aroma with some caramel, roasted grains and some dark fruit. Very dark brown in color. Wow, big dissapointment in the flavor. Very weak and watery. A little roastyness and minimal sweetness. Pretty bland. Finish is a little creamy with a little lingering roastyness. An ok brew but really not a very good porter.
Nicolet Bock;Florence, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Nicolet Brewing Company;"The bock and the ""dark pils"" have the same annoying yeasty, cidery sourness that really prevents you from drinking a full bottle. There are many decent Wisconsin bocks, all of those made by Huber, the bocks of Point and Leinies, for example. This is NOT one of them."
Nicolet Dark Pilsner;Florence, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Nicolet Brewing Company;Festival Tap: Clear brown, nicely carbonated with a very toasty nose. Light coffee notes throughout.
Nicolet Dark Pilsner;Florence, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Nicolet Brewing Company;"Sampled at Great Taste of the Midwest. Very nice aroma, rich roasted malt, chocolate, coffee. Dark, mostly opaque, thin head; off-white. Flavor is blah, plain, nothing to right home about. Not an inspiring brew for my 400th."
Nicolet Dark Pilsner;Florence, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Nicolet Brewing Company;"RERATE: I assuredly had an infected bottle of this the first time around - it still seems oddly sour, but having had Kraftbrau's version of this dark Czech style recently, I recognize the flavor as stylistic and intentional. The sour edge balances nice roasted flavors and produces a fine deep night of a beer. The brewers tells me that they've had consistency problems due to unfortunate handling by distributors in the past. Now they handle their own distribution, so it's less likely to get a slimy bottle like the ones Legion and I tried in the past. Original Rate 12/28/2001 (.9) The bock and the ""dark pils"" have the same annoying yeasty, cidery sourness that really prevents you from drinking a full bottle. The dark pils is the worse of the two, with notes of stomach acid as well."
Nicolet Dark Pilsner;Florence, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Nicolet Brewing Company;A decent american dark. Dark copper color, with a light colored head that diminishes rather quickly. Slight DMS and dark roast aroma. Flavors of dark roasted malt. Schwartz beer qualities. Medium body. Fairly light hops in the finish.
Nicolet Dark Pilsner;Florence, Wisconsin, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Nicolet Brewing Company;"Deep-dark porter-like; Head was thick and dense; Nice roasted nose. So far so good- let me taste this real quick **moving it towards my mouth**- YUCK. So much promise in this beer- looked good smelled good, but tastes like s**t! Sour, cola-like. I though it might be a bad bottle until I saw the rate by Hennes. Maybe these guys should give it a rest."
Shed Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Wow what a criminally low rating. Sure it's not a usual Amber but shed doesn't deserve this level of disrespect. Toasty roasty, yet lean and slammable, shed Amber succeeds where so many other dark beers have failed at providing a dark beer you want pint after pint. Notes of fine molasses and caramel resonate with scortched Scottish toffee. This beer is distilled autumn.
Shed Amber Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a rustic hazy dark orange almost amber color with a thin white foamy finger�s worth of head. The aroma takes on a sweet roasted nuttiness rolling over smooth caramel to toffee malts. Sly grassy hops. The flavor yields to the nutty to caramel and toffee malts first and then opens up with some grassy hops. Dry malty sort of aftertaste with a crisp finish. On the palate, this one sat sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. ABV seems good. Overall, good amber ale that I could have again.

Old Saddleback Widow Whites Brew;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;"Bottled. Decent-sized head that dies very quickly; dark amber pale-ale type appearance; beery grainy aroma (not large) ; maltier, sweeter and fuller than the typical lager, but in this case thats not a good thing as the sweetness seems slightly corn-flavored and becomes cloying and too heavy quickly; at the end the flavor completely disappears in a few seconds but for rather unpleasant stomach sensation which lasted for a considerable time. Coulda been a bad bottle, but as I'm not impressed with the brewer's other products, I won't be bothering to find out. Proves that you can make stuff as bad as Bud or Miller in a small town in Massachusetts."
Old Saddleback Widow Whites Brew;Pittsfield, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Old Saddleback Brewing Co.;This beer is a find! It definitely is smooth. I do like a more malty beer, but this beer was not extremely sweet. Really well balanced. Lame label but never judge a brew by its...

Reepham Granary Bitter;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Reepham Brewery;Cask at GBBF 2006. Amber, no head. Odd aroma, slight chemical/petrol that others liked, but I didn�t. OK malt, but this is weird and odd with that aroma.

Reepham Granary Bitter;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Reepham Brewery;Cask (handpump) at GBBF, August 2005. This brewery has been going for over 20 years but its beers are not easy to find. This was my first rating from this brewery and not an auspicious start. Golden colour, not entirely clear. Aroma was full of underdeveloped malt with a strange (for a bitter) smoky edge. Dull, stagnant mouthfeel. Some sharpness, with green apple notes. Manifestly not ready. Either that or its a bad beer. I�ll re-rate if the opportunity arises. Let�s hope I don�t have to wait another 20 years and its better next time.

Reepham Rapier Pale Ale;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Reepham Brewery;GBBF, 2005. There�s toffee, but just a tad too much because there�s also that nasty brewing chemical - like a dinosaur. The hops are bad. Cardboard and old socks. I didn�t enjoy this.
Reepham Rapier Pale Ale;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Reepham Brewery;Cask (handpump), GBBF, August 2005. A second dubious beer from Reepham at GBBF. Deep gold colour. Big diacetyl hit on the nose. Some mild herbal notes and dry malt. Otherwise the aroma, flavour and mouthfeel were oddly dull and lifeless. More like a beer that was going over the top than one that wasn�t ready.Not undrinkable, but not exactly enjoyable. I�ll give this a second chance if the opportunity arises.

Heavyweight Cinderbock Lager;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Heavyweight Brewing Company;A big thank you to Adrian for opening this superb brew from now defunct (sad to say) Heavyweight.

Heavyweight Cinderbock Lager;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Heavyweight Brewing Company;12oz Bottle. Aroma throws a really rich fresh smoked salmon, even including the salty sea oils. Nice malt back. Pours a rosy amber pale brown that throws a nice off-white soapy head. Nice, bambergian smoked alder, pig fat bacon, and light salty wood. Bock character is subtle and underlying. This is the most like the Bamberg examples of any American smoked beer. Nice roasted pig and long campfire finish. This is really smoky, even at this age. A bit of white and gray ash. This is solid.
Heavyweight Cinderbock Lager;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Heavyweight Brewing Company;12 oz bottle thanks to jimmack shared at the preBeerwars gathering. I didn�t take copious notes on this one so I�m going on memory but it has only been a few hours. Pours a hazy orangey/amber with an average to small sized whiteish head. Aroma still has lots of smoke over an earthy peat body with some caramel malt backbone. Medium bodied with average carbonation even after several years of sitting around. Flavor of smokey bbq rub, dense malts and earth notes. This one is still holding up nicely and if you can find it, get it!!!!
Heavyweight Cinderbock Lager;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Wow. Held up pretty well. There is a touch of funk and sourness, but it is mostly good. Nose is sweet and smoky with some raisins and brown sugar. Flavor follows suit with a nice smoke bite and a lot of sweetness. The sweetness is a little cloying, but the smoke balances it out well. Even after all this time, it isn�t bad.
Heavyweight Cinderbock Lager;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Heavyweight Brewing Company;2006 bottle. Good lord has this held up to time quite nicely! Clear at first with lots of haze and silverish sediment particals. Bamberg sort of smoke with a slight hint of peaty sharpness. A little bandaid. Clean malt. Medium body. A bit fuller than most lagers. Substantial carbonation, not just for age. Smokey sharpness. Wood smoke with some bit of peaty oxidized grape sort of smoke. Full malt. A bit toasty. Astringent finish. Very nice, a shame this isn�t made any longer.

Golden Avalanche Donner Weiss;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;"Tap @ the brewery. Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a 1"" thick head. Nose is wheaty and citric. Flavor is citrus, pleasently sour, with a nice wheaty body. Somewhat sweet but lacking that banana undertone which I so love in a hefe and could have had a bigger mouthfeel. None the less, I enjoyed the refreshing qualities of this brew."

Golden Avalanche Donner Weiss;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Appears a hazy light gold with a small pure white cap that slowly fades into a collar. Little streams of carbonation pump their way up to the top of the glass. Smell is of Bavarian yeast, banana, cream, clove, and sulfer dioxide. I asked the brewer, Chris Rafferty, about the sulfer smell and he agreed that it is there. He also said that he felt that it belonged there with the style. Taste is of the banana, beautiful wheat, bubblegum, clove, along with that funky sulfer that is slightly obtrusive but not overly offensive. Mouthfeel is sweet, crispy, smooth, and semi-dry.

Daves Original Honey Brown Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated August 2006. Second beer tasted from Dave�s menu. Pours a copper-brown colour with a decent off-white head that is creamy, has good retention and leaves above average lace. Highly carbonated and has a malty nose with alcohol and light hop bitterness. Starts off with some metallic taste, but then goes into a more pleasant hoppy finish. Some grain and mild... well lets just say it is bland. You can taste more the sweetness from the honey when drinking from the bottle. From the glass, it was overall not that good.
Daves Original Honey Brown Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Aroma of a sweet pale lager-a hint of honey, but that macrobrew malty scent is still there. The honey is very, very subtle in the taste. Palate is smooth, almost no carbonation. Medium body. This one could do better with higher hop content.
Daves Original Honey Brown Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);The highest rating is the appearance, its beautiful, mild malt, a hint of honey, way better in the afternoon. I liked it too.
Daves Original Honey Brown Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);The label won�t fool you. This is really quite subpar and a juvenile attempt at a dark lager. What I got as styrofoam and vinegar was supposed to be the alleged honey brown taste. Gross
Daves Original Honey Brown Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Brown in colour. Small aroma of malt with a slight sweetness. Flavour was very bland, slightly sweet. Not much body. Finishes slight sweet. Very bland and boring.

Daves Original Honey Brown Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Not much to this one. bit darker than Sleeman's Honey Brown. Pretty thin on body and flavour.
Daves Original Honey Brown Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This one was not fun to drink. I thought 'honey brown' was supposed to mean that it had some honey smell and taste and that it was brown. Dave must have missed that meeting.
Daves Original Honey Brown Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Stay away from daves beer. its not good for ya, just look at dave he's got stamach alcers from drinking this crap

Golden Avalanche Onyx Cream Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. Black, of course. Roasty up front, but a there�s a bit too much funk in this, like a poorly assembled home brew -- tastes like an undercooked extract. Ech. (#5780, 10/7/2014)
Golden Avalanche Onyx Cream Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;On tap, at brewery. A nice stout, with aroma of roasted malt and chocolate. Flavor is pretty much the same. This seems a lot like Guinness, with a bit more alcohol and some chocolate.

Golden Avalanche Onyx Cream Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewery. Nose is light cream and butter notes atop some low level roast. Sweet sugars (molasses) in the nose as well. Creamy palate up front, with sweet coffee creamer tasted, any roast in this stout comes off instead as toasted white bread. Pale and dusty, with some small hint at bourbn at time... but overall I think this needs a lot of work.
Golden Avalanche Onyx Cream Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;"Draft @ Golden Avalanche, pre-BCTC beerventure. Pours a dark, cherry-cola color; medium tan head with great retention and lacing; nice pour. Sweet caramel and nougat (tootsie rolls, actually) in the aroma; slightly buttery. Sharp carbonation in a medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy caramel and milk chocolate, with a dense, sweet malt core; still shows a bit too much diacetyl, almost like buttery popcorn. Pretty drinkable and reasonably ok, but slightly off. Medium, caramel and sugary finish."

Golden Avalanche Onyx Cream Stout;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Tap. Probably the best beer the Kutztown Tavern regularly produces. It appears fairly dark with a rough off white head. I do not believe the head overwhelmingly creamy or rich in any capacity. One can detect roasted dark chocolate and roasted hops. The alcohol content is solid and makes for a warming beverage in the late fall.

Altenm�nster Brauer Bier Hopfig Mild;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Allg�uer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Here is one of those beers that doesn't inspire millions of adjectives but still deserves respect. It's a very pale, slightly cloudy yellow colour, with honey and cereal aromas. The flavour is very simple: pure fresh, grainy pale malt, with virtually no hop character except light bitterness at the very finish. Sure, it's a bland, watery lager, but it's a quality bland, watery lager. Definitely a Bavarian hell rather than a pils if categories are important to you. REr8: yeah yeah the malt is nice, but there's too much alcohol flavour (dunno how they do it at 4.9%) and a weird camembert rind aftertaste that is tasty and interesting in trois monts, where it also turns up, but sort of disgusting in a german lager.
Altenm�nster Brauer Bier Hopfig Mild;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Allg�uer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Sulfury nose and a light gold color. Very quick profile that ends sweet.

De 3 Horne Maasbrees Winterbier;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De 3 Horne;(Fairly aged sample) Colour is brown with golden shine, like strong Indian tea. Thick dark-creamy head, nearly immediately gone. Cola-like pearling. Spicey nose: cloves, black cardemoms, dark brown sugar, some madeirisation. Tart, bitterish, spicey taste on a sweet underbuild. Madeirisation is nothing exaggerated. Roasted peanuts and esters retronasal. medium bodied but a bit watery texture, at odds with high ABV - maybe an effect of the esterisation. Quite pleasing, actually - much better than when young. Beer has benefitted from lagering.

Full Sail Wreck the Halls;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;"From Mar 2006 Poured from bottle (room temp) a hazy reddish gold with a large head of foam that dissipated slowly leaving an ample layer with some lacing. The smell is very fruity with citrus notes and pine. The taste is dominated by citrus up front but then some caramel sweetness moves in to balance it out. The finish returns to bitterness but it's not at all intense. Bottom line: An interesting interpretation of an American IPA with a taste that's off the beaten track a bit but it doesn't really strike my palate in a way that would make me want to buy this very often. Hehe...I guess that's why it's a seasonal. ;^)"

Full Sail Wreck the Halls;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;22 oz bottle shared, purchased at the Craft Beer Cellar - Fort Collins. A hoppy, spiced up red ale with moderate bitterness. Notes of caramel and musty hop resin. Not too bad, but probably dated.
Full Sail Wreck the Halls;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;The nose is a little herbal and peppery. Sort of like a leek. It has a decent body, a hint of biscuit that comes hidden amongst a surprisingly robust bitterness and white pepper spice.
Full Sail Wreck the Halls;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Really a nice combination of winter warmer and IPA. Not sure I could pick it out of a style lineup, but it�s bright, piney, citrus-y and it has a toffee/caramel finish.

Speakeasy Old Godfather;San Francisco, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Shared with Strykzone on Facebook Chat Poured near red with a beige head. Nose of caramel, toffee, fig, pine, and other fruit. Medium plus body. Some alcohol tasted. But some bad. Flavor is like the aroma with more fruit including pineapple and plum. Quite a combination. Final pour turns very murcky. Finishes sweet. Overall quite complex and very tasty. Nice in all respects.
Speakeasy Old Godfather;San Francisco, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Bomber from hayduke via facebook chat. Murky mid brown with a fluffy beige head. A rich and complex fruit aroma. Stone, citrus. The flavor brings that and is plenty sweet. A rich malt effect, too makes for plenty to ferment. Bourbon is light at best but there is some wood notes. Toffee and fruit pretty much sum this one up. Throw in some alcohol. Pineapple and more tropical fruit emerge. But late this beer gets more malty and bready, spicy, too. This is different from other BWs. No harsheness at all and so much more fruit and it even seems to be pulpy. Finish is a bit buttery. Smooth and rich.
Speakeasy Old Godfather;San Francisco, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Aroma is toffee, English toffee and sweet oak barrels.The thick malt profile is multilayered and complex. A very good palette given the ABV.

Rich bready boozy English Barleywine notes with a dash of wood and cherry and dates. Smooth and semisweet fruity flavor that�s got almost like some red grape and dark red berry flavors with a malty boozy depth and that woody tone is back from the nose. Semi fruity and fleshy with an almost boring malt base.

The aroma has a little caramel, lots of hay, barnyard and plowed dirt. The taste is grainy, a little caramel sweetness, more dirt and grains. The texture is fairly light with nice fizz. The aroma is great, the flavor fine.
Speakeasy Old Godfather;San Francisco, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Speakeasy Ales and Lagers;Strong woody spicy sweet caramel cocoa aroma. Reminds me of their prohibition ale. Pours an amberish brown with small creamy yellowish head Strong malty sweet flavor of caramel and cocoa well balanced with woody spicy hop. Surprisingly easy to drink. Medium full bodied, medium CO2, slight alcohol warmth, tongue numbing, lasting bitter finish that beckons for another sip. Very well balanced American Barleywine. I enjoy the hops that Speakeasy likes to use. I have no problem sipping this all night ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Crisp hop flavours. Floral and slightly spicy. High carbonation level. Medium-bodied, but is on the light side. Flavour is of dry lighly burnt caramel and dark sugars. Peppery aftertaste. The lack of a head and the coarse carbonation pulls down the overall impression. It is pretty much like drinking coca cola with a little dark wort.
Gamlestadens Jul�l;Herrljunga, Sweden;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrljunga Cider (Gamlestadens Bryggeri);Bottle 50cl. Clear medium amber color with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to light beige head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, bread, paper, brown sugar notes.

Gamlestadens Jul�l;Herrljunga, Sweden;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Herrljunga Cider (Gamlestadens Bryggeri);Medium yellow coarse head disappears immediately, leaving absolutely nothing. Dark red translucent body. Syrupy licorice and dishwater aroma. (WTF?) Dryish-sweetish licorice taste with earthy meaty notes. Empty body. Dry roasty papery, peppery aftertaste with acidic notes. Lacking in bitterness. Decent, but flawed. (0.5l bottle, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.)

Three Hearts Jul�l Export;Halmstad, Sweden;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kr�nleins Bryggeri;"02-02-2019; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The looks of the beer are nice. The beer is pretty dark, just like the other Swedish Christmas beers that I had earlier this week. The colour is a reddish chestnut with a coppery reddish brown glow. It looks kinda nice. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer there is a nice layer of frothy almond coloured foam. Nice looks. The aroma of the beer is fine. It isn't to special to be honest. The malts are biscuity and bready. There seems to be a touch of rye. Also some caramel is there. Hops are a bit fruity, but mainly herbal. It is nice. There are some fruity notes overall. Not bad, but not too special. The taste of the beer is comparable. Quite sweet, medium bitterness, and a bit thin. It is balanced, but could have had a tiny bit more power for it to be even better. The palate is also fine. Medium body, a bit thin texture and medium carbonation. The finish is short and has some toffee and caramel, which both die away rather quickly. But, all in all, not a bad beer. I like it. Good thirst quencher."

Rockhopper Lager;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);"super cool label featuring a clearly petulant penguin. and i've never had a beer ""brewed in chile"" before-- how do they DO that? i don't know anything about brewing, but if it's chile con carne, i'm not drinkin' it-- i'm a vegetarian. looking into the depths of the bottle however, i can see that, yes, there does seem to be some chile right in there. looks like crumbled sponge or some kinda flim --maybe penguin flim? it sure pours like a lager: pale, hearts of celery yellow, with a macro kind of fizzy head. the aroma is fairly inoffensive, doesn't smell like chile at all. and flim aside, there's no adjuncts apparent. paper and the most gossamer note of floral hops. flavor is club soda with subtle beer notes. clean, but with brutish carbonation and watery citrus acidity. seriously-- there's a LOT of nasty bulbous looking primitive lifeforms floating in this beer, like lemon pulp, but it doesn't taste bad. it doesn't taste good either. pretty neutral. it probably goes good with chile. canned chile."
Rockhopper Lager;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Saw this at a beer fest, where I was led to believe it was something other than macro-swill. Oops. Imagine a Coors Light. Okay, now imagine it has a slightly sweeter aftertaste, possibly even some citrus. Now imagine me pouring the rest out.
Rockhopper Lager;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);No aroma to speak of, but at least it did not sell bad. Very light in color, no head to speak of. Wery watery with a roasted corn flavor. Blah.
Rockhopper Lager;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Golden and white-headed. Lemony aroma. Wow ... hoppy flavors! Rich and smooth. This isn't nearly as bad as I'd expected. No skunk.
Rockhopper Lager;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Sparkling clear straw-colored brew. Small, creamy white head. No lacing. The nose is lightly malty and yeasty. Otherwise, not much of an aroma. Maybe a hint of honey. The flavor is lightly citrusy up front. Well-balanced with a very slightly tart hop presence on the backside. A touch bland and thin, but enjoyable for the style. Light-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish. When in Chile, drink this beer... because it's probably all they have to offer! Avoid it elsewhere!
Rockhopper Lager;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Very light yellow. Nose is nonexistent. Not much flavor, that that there is is overly sweet and full of adjuncts. No real bitterness, just bland sweetness, but hey, at least it's not skunked. It gets extra points for that, and the fact that it has a penguin on the label and let's face it--like Lyle Lovett says, I go for penguins.
Rockhopper Lager;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Light straw colored - very much in the vain of a Coors Lite - not offensive, just no body or flavor to speak of.
Rockhopper Lager;Chile;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compania Cervecerias Unidas (Heineken);Light and pasteurized with little charater. Typical macro-swill. This beer is very pale and loaded with corn flavors.
Vermont Pub Burton Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"I ordered this a week ago and thought I got the IPA by mistake (I was unable to verify this at that time); tonight, I found out I was right. Well, IPA is better, but this is an interesting, respectable lager that doesn't seem to easily fit any category. Dark brown and cloudy with little head and little nose, I was a bit worried until my first sip. Flavor was a delicious dry, earthy, velvety smooth thing that really go my attention. Unlike anything else that readily comes to mind, except perhaps Fraoch Heather Ale. Not really sweet, but with little bite at the end. Not for lovers of hit-you-over-the-head tastes, this is an interesting experiment that I'll surely have again."

Durham Signature Ale;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;County Durham Brewing;"473 mL Can. Amber body with a thin foamy off-white head settling to a film leaving ample spotty lace. Aroma of pale and crystal malts, a citrus note, an innuendo of honey; the bouquet seems to struggle to express itself. Flavor mainly of pale sweet malts, hops show up but don't overly impose, an aftertaste of treacle and a clean hoppy finish."
Durham Signature Ale;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;County Durham Brewing;Bottle. Half hazy brown orange body with a white head. The aroma is malty. The taste is slightly sour and very balanced.

Nice stock rotation LCBO! That being said this stuff doesn�t seem to have suffered much. Pour is light burnt orange with two fingers of creamy off-white cap. Solid retention, good lacing. Nose is all malt (shocking) with lots of caramel, toasted grain/bread. Taste is a surprisingly sturdy toasty caramel malt with a slightly bitter earthy finish. I didn�t encounter any yoghurt, but I did encounter a bit of that lovely Steamwhistle Blood Mouth effect that my buddy Tiki mentions. In my case it was pretty faint. Serviceable bitter, all around.
Durham Signature Ale;Pickering, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - English;County Durham Brewing;beautiful English pale. The story here is malts, in abundance that are incredible for the ABV. Toasty and flavorful.

Watou Tripel;Watou, Belgium;Tripel;St. Bernardus Brouwerij;Bottle, bb 4/21. Pale amber with a dense white head that lasts very well. Aroma is pretty restrained with honeyed dough and spices. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Tastes much as it smells with almost sharp spicy bitter finish. Some fruit - apricot, nectarines, no citrus - but it's all a bit thwacked by the spicy end. Very much Westmalle territory.

Nose is malts, some fruits, yeast, light bitter. Taste is thin, malts, some yeast, soft bitter touch. Smell was promising more than the taste revealed.

Nose is barley and fresh hop aroma. Taste is slight bittersweet. I wouldnt say this is a blonde. Taste is way too shallow in my opinion. High carbonation and sticky mouthfeel. Cool that they only serve it at the cave of Han.
La Blonde du Domaine des Grottes de Han;Purnode-Yvoir, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Du Bocq;Mooi biertje voor wie op bezoek gaat naar de grotten van Han. Zoet bier met een licht bittere nasmaak. Dit bier is echter alleen te verkrijgen bij de grotten van Han

Taste: pretty sweet, sugary, almonds, some citrus, little sourish. Aftertaste: soft bitterness, green apple, some citrus, sugary, apple juice.

Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);Bottle. Pours a light brune body with a thin off white lacing. Malty with some light toast tones, crackers, berries, a bit of chewy malts, and raisin hints. Hops are a bit soapy and diminished with a light papery oxidation note. Thin and light with a grainy finish. Its okay.
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);Pours dark ruby red with very little head that dissipates quickly. It smells like green olives. Flavor is sweet and malty. It is fruity and vinous, but not very good. Some weird flavors going on. Medium body with lively carbonation.
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);the aroma is very yeast with some smell of the malts, taste is tart and unpleasant bitter, palate is thin and does not offer that much
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);The aroma is sweet and skunky with some maltiness and not much rice. The appearance is amber with a very small head. The flavor is funky with both sweet malt and rancid rice. The palate is thin. Overall this is really bad.
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);12 oz. pours a dirty amber with aroma of maple sugar, decent head. Flavor is a mixture of sweet malt and off tastes of dirty wood. Palate is thin and watery, but probably better that way. Not a flavor to savor. Overall, decent with food, but not too enjoyable on it�s own.
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);"Pours a hazed ruby with no head. Nose is slightly malty, but there is a part of it that seems like it smells like wet wood. Flavor holds very little character and gets watery very fast. For a quick moment you get a malty sweet that holds strong caramalized characteristics. But nothing else comes besides that and when it fades all that seems left is a thin watered down beverage. Feel is good. Nice level of bubble on the mouth. But you get that dirty water, watered down edge. Drinkable, sure. This might have to be ""your thing"" for you to really go for it. I tried it for novelty�s sake."
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);May the gods have mercy on me. I�ve had this sitting in my fridge for almost two months, and have decided to open it. The aroma is interesting... sour, with hints of Michigan cherries. Pours red with a head that quickly fades away. Now for the difficult part... I take my first sip. Drinkable, but there�s some strange flavors coming through... slight sweetness, and then some strange flavor that I can�t place. Really watery body, but with a long finish of that unknown flavor. Wait! I think I�ve placed it... bad sake. Even at $3 a sixer, I don�t think I�ll ever be tempted to get this again.
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);Bottle... Cloudy burnt orange lager with a small, fizzy, white head. Hundreds of Champagne-like bubbles cling to the side of the glass. Decent, creamy retention. Vinous nose provides notes of vanilla and praline with an undertone of some kind of funky berry/fruit. Sweet, vinous flavor... grape or cherry soda-like. Not really offensive, but barely hopped. More of that funky berry/fruit on the palate. Light-bodied and thin with lively carbonation. Sweet, watery finish.
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);Rated 3/15/06: The sixer at the store was 2 bucks off so I figured I�d give it a try. This is one extremely interesting beer. Pours a river water cloudy amber color. Nice carbonation is present. The pour is unique in that the head fizzles at first like a soda and then dissipates, again like a soda. No lacing is present. The aroma is an odd mix of sweet syrup or molasses and very sweet malts. The scent is invitingly annoying. The flavor I could probably write a chapter on and still not be able to adequately describe. It is very sweet and malty and reinforces the characteristics of the aroma. Thin mouthfeel with a sticky finish that leaves a tricky aftertaste. This beer is an enigma to me, I will not likely look for it again. Very out of the ordinary and unique worth it to try it and see for yourself.
Yinpu Black Rice Beer;Harbin, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);Surprising. Thin, grainy, astringent, yet manages to carry off a certain flavor profile. Mainly a balance between simple rice sweetness, some burnt flavors, and ending bitterness. Hmm.
Dominus Dubbel / Double;Genval, Belgium;Dubbel;John Martin;Not a very strong aroma. Some hops though. Fruty flavour with some hops at the end. Not a very strong carbonation.

Dominus Triple;Genval, Belgium;Tripel;John Martin;A beer that is in the great tradition of Belgian beers. Do not disappoint but do not surprise. It is a very correct cerebellum, which is allowed to enjoy. A triple good but not exellent.

Dominus Triple;Genval, Belgium;Tripel;John Martin;Clear, light amber color with white head. Aroma has mostly sugary sweetness and some fermented fruit notes that don't mix together too well.

I really don't like this one, it doesn't have any redeeming qualities.

Holgate Brewhouse White Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Holgate Brewhouse;Pale, cloudy yellow. Aroma of unripe banana, maybe a hint of coriander. A little dry on the palate. Some hints of banana come through in the flavour. Light and a bit thin. Nothing special.
Holgate Brewhouse White Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Holgate Brewhouse;From a 330ml bottle on 18/12/2011.

Holgate Brewhouse White Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Holgate Brewhouse;330ml bottle. Slightly darker in colour than expected, though this is not a bad thing.

Holgate Brewhouse White Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Holgate Brewhouse;"Bottle. Pale, hazy golden pour with a short white head that doesn�t last long. Aroma is weak but fairly standard for a wit: orange, coriander, banana and clove plus a faint chalky undertone. Flavour is also pretty weak; similar to the aroma but very watery with a mineral character that stands out. Thin, watery mouthfeel with low carbonation and a very short dry finish. Refreshing like mineral water but pretty average as a beer."
Holgate Brewhouse White Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Holgate Brewhouse;Pour at Warners at the Bay Beer Festival 2010. Noticeable belgian yeast aroma, flavours of coriander, yeast, honey, and spice. Decent for the style, but nothing spectacular.

Watery and bland. I last had one of these maybe ten years ago and it was massively overcarbonated and kind of bad-funky and metallic.

Phoenix;Dundalk, Ireland;Red Ale - Irish;Macardle Moore (Guinness);Definitely Ireland's best Ale and best kept secret. Much smoother than smithwicks with a fuller body and remarkably good on the palate. This is very much a true traditional Irish ale and a must for all serious beer drinkers. Now only available in bottles this is a wonderful beer to taste at both room temperature or chilled. Another grea Irish beer (like Hoffmans) that is slowly being killed off by Guinnesses focus on mass market beers.

Porterhouse Plain Porter;Dublin, Ireland;Stout;Porterhouse Brew Co.;7th Sep 2019, half-pint in the Porthouse, Temple Bar, Dublin. Decent enough Porter, made the mistake of having alongside their excellent Oyster Stout, so this seemed a little weak and watery compared to that. Nothing wrong with this though, plenty of chocolate maltiness to chew on.
Porterhouse Plain Porter;Dublin, Ireland;Stout;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Bei diesem Porter wurde an der Geschmacksschraube gedreht, damit es nicht in die s��lich-malzige geht, sondern man will dem edlen Hopfen eine kleine B�hne bieten. Ein Versuch, der etwas nach hinten losging. So ist es anderen Portern gegen�ber eher schmachbr�stig, der Hopfen kommt trotzdem nicht ganz raus. Man kann es wohl leicht trinken, aber ein wirklich tolles Geschmackserlebnis ist es nicht.

Porterhouse Oyster Stout;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Flavored;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Angeblich ein Bier, das nichts f�r Vegetarier ist, da es mit Austernfleisch gebraut wurde. Geschmacklich merkt man nicht zu viel davon, nur einen leicht salzig-fischigen Nachgeschmack. Als Stout gef�llt es mir insofern, da es sch�ne Aromen nach R�stmalz, dunkler Schokolade und Kakao hat. Das ganze in angenehmer Ausgewogenheit, so wie es sein soll. Es k�nnte etwas voller sein, aber aromentechnisch ist es top.

Hilden Scullions Irish Ale;Lisburn, County Antrim, Northern Ireland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hilden Brewery;On tap @ the Haymarket. This is somewhere between an Irish Red Ale and an English Bitter. Fruity and malty notes dominate the nose and the palate. There is reasonable balance even if there is some malt astringency on the finish. It looks attractive!

Lost Lake;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;Another mysterious and random malt likka-ish thing from Woodman's Appleton. 8/9/19. 24 ounce can for about 99 cents. Clear golden amber, thin fizzy white head, poor retention. Aroma of cardboard and corn. Taste is caramel, grain, plum-like fruits. Thin, a bit watery. Worth the price.
Lost Lake;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;24 oz. can. Pours a thick, rapidly collapsing white head, with no lacing, over a clear bubbly, clear, yellow (SRM 3) body.......nose is mild malts, slight herbal hops tones, balanced......taste is mild slightly sweet malt tones, mild herbal hops, mild bitter finish.....mouth feel, light body, no alcohol, high carbonation. This is a very light beer that almost totally misses the label stated style of Pilsner, making it a Pale Lager with the result it is only slightly drinkable. BJCP 5/2/6/4/4
Lost Lake;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;Taste: slight hop, mellow thin, not much zip. Mild grain nose.Gold, clear, with white soapy head and delicate lace. Lite body. A boating beer that closer to a lite beer.
Lost Lake;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;U kno, i actually like this stuff quite a bit. nothing bothers me about it. super easy to drink with that classic rockdale apple sweetness. crispy
Lost Lake;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;"Poured from a cold 12 oz. can into a footed pilsner glass. I purchase this beer (in 12 packs) for one of my son�s who enjoys having a few periodically. It�s OK; kinda sparse on the flavor side but drinkable enough to say it�s beer. And, there�s a lake up in northern Colorado named Lost Lake, too. Maybe it�d taste different fishing off a Lost Lake shore."
Lost Lake;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;Can at Sputnik. When this was really cold, it wasn�t that bad. Not great, but not horrible. As it got less cold it got much worse. Though it is sweet like creamed corn, it�s not over the top. The hop character is weird, almost stale. It tastes kind of like the inside of a cereal box. I will say it�s better than some other mass produced pale lagers I�ve had. This does avoid the punishing sweetness, any sour/green apple character is pretty minimal, and it most certainly tastes like beer.
Lost Lake;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;24 ounce can purchased for 99 cents at some gas station a couple of months ago, poured ice-cold into a Coors glass. Very pale yellow, big head dies quickly...aroma of DMS, plastic, and the dirty bathwater after my nieces have had their bath...very sweet-sugary at the front, less sweet finish but the sugar isn�t replaced by much of anything...syrupy, watery, low carbonation. Not as offensive as a lot of crap but...not much else.
Lost Lake;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;I love this beer. My life changed after drinking this beer. It inspired me to leave my wife and be the drinker I was meant to be. God bless v this beer and God bless the United States.

Ittinger Dunkelblond;Frauenfeld, Switzerland;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brauhaus Sternen;tortilla chip yellow, head locked on like a barnacle. appearance may be bock, but aroma and flavor more closely approximate a vienna: nice medium nose, brown sugar, raisin bran. tasty multi-grain toastiness, medium bodied, light sweetness, whiskey notes. enough hops to finish on the dry side. not enough sustenance here to sustain a long fast, the monks probably use this to hold 'em over between regular meals. decent session.

Tel Aviv Brewhouse Moonshine;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Why they sell this? it seems been made by a rookie homebrewer. no aroma, tastes like yeast and some moldy wet cloth.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Moonshine;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;weak aroma with grassy and resiny notes, weak head and deep orange color verging on woody, good initial mouthfeel with slight sourness and a hint of hoppiness.

Tel Aviv Brewhouse Moonshine;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Fresh keg. Very cloudy. Light tan. The aroma is a bit yeasty, with light biscuity malts. Tastes yeasty, has spicy-minty notes. Definitely this one is green. Not unenjoyable, but certainly not a refined, top quality beer.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Moonshine;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Draft @ brewpub. Terribly muddled with rusty water color and a scant head. Same yeasty-sweet fruity aroma as the Masters, with lychee and white fruit flesh simplicity. Thin and fizzy. As yeasty as it looks but inoffensive enough. Barely any malt or hop character except for the blonde cookie dough flavors. Pretty weak.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Moonshine;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Red coloured beer with lots of carbonation and a small white head. Light aroma, with some fruity and yeasty hints. Medium fruity palate. Finish is light sweet bitter finished. Misses some flavour, rather short ending.

Medium-bodied. OK.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Moonshine;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Very good amber lager, well reminiscent of good brewpub beers in Germany. Unique location and very nice brewpub in Tel Aviv.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Moonshine;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;The middle cousin of the three offerings at the brewpub. A pale amber somewhat malt accented, lightly hopped lager.

Tel Aviv Brewhouse Masters;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Dark brown. Light caramel head. Toasty, caramel note. Same taste but with a hint of bubblegum. Still pretty amateur.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Masters;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Draft @ brewpub. Actually they were tapped out and poured from pre-poured growlers but it�s the same thing. Muddy brown, ugly liquid. The tan head manages to stay stable though. Sweet fruity aroma with ripe plum, lychee, and candy sweetness. Soft carbonation with a thin finish. Simplistic but not bad. Finishes watery and abruptly. No malt complexity. Is doughy with some pleasant malt sugars to redeem, and a bread crust flavor that would be nice if it were allowed to emerge more. Not horrible but pretty disappointing.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Masters;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Brown coloured beer with some light carbonation and a small light brown head. Sweeter caramel aroma with some fruity like berry hints. Medium to full palate. Finish is sweet, suggary with some light unfermented hint. Ending is light caramel and sugary. Probably needs more fermentation time.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Masters;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;From tap, Brownish red hazy with medium tan head, lager classic aromas with sweet malts and some spices notes like clove and cinnammon, roasty malt flavors with low-medium sweetness and some grapefruit hoppiness, nice one.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Masters;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Draught at the brewpub, big creamy long lasting head, medium dark brown colour and quite opaque with strong carbonation. Lightish roasted malt notes. flavour of milk chocolate, bread and light coffee and fruit notes, overall not to sweet. Aftertaste long and sour with some unpleasant metalic notes creeping in. This brew could have used more roasted malt and a bigger body. Not to bad but could have been much better.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Masters;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;Draught at the brewpub. Unclear deep ruby-brown with a short-lasting beige head. Aroma of malt, caramel and hints of fruits. Sweet flavor of malt, caramel, notes of toast, and faint fruity hints. Medium-bodied. Still nothing great, but the best of the brewhouse�s beers and a decent one.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Masters;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;It is not hard to overshadow this beer but I must admit I was stunned to find any rating for this beer and doubly stunned by the global quality of Omhper�s ratings. Not much to add that he hasn�t. Sweet, malty but not complex. Tel Aviv is great. Their beer scene is not.
Tel Aviv Brewhouse Masters;Tel Aviv, Israel;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Tel Aviv Brewhouse;The most fullbodied of all the beers in Israel's not-so-vibrating beer scene. A nut brown, softly malty strongish lager. A well made, well balanced lager.

Tian-Shan Klassicheskoe (Classic);Almaty, Kazakhstan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Dinal LLP Brewery (Efes Karaganda);Named after the mighty mountain range in the southeast of the country you are lead to believe that the beer will be fresh as a mountain creek. But no, already the smell of old wollen socks tells you that your assumption was wrong. This is a golden coloured sweetish and unclean standard lager with low bitterness.
Kronendal Nut;Hout Bay, South Africa;Brown Ale;Kronendal Brewhouse and Restaurant;This brewpub must have one of the most picturesque locations of all the brewpubs in the world. This nutty, rich ale is named after the brewmaster (according to the bartender).

The sweetness doesn�t follow into the taste a great deal, but it isn�t a bitter taste, it has a hoppy bite and the malted Barley also comes to the fore as the beer warms. Clean mouthfeel rather than a rich, heavy, creamy texture. The 4.5% is evident but blends well into the well balanced beer. I don�t like bottles of UK Ale to state �Served Chilled�. I did because they asked me too, but a proper UK Ale should come to the table at about 50-52F degrees.
Sharps Eden Pure Ale;Rock, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sharp's Brewery (Molson Coors);Clear bottle from Coop, Wadesbridge. Pours clear amber with a thin white film. Aroma is caramel and a whiff of fruity hops. Taste is dry and malty toffee with some herbal twist towards the end,
Sharps Eden Pure Ale;Rock, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sharp's Brewery (Molson Coors);@ Eden Project. Dull brown. The aroma is kind of gingery. The taste is sweetish, mostly caramelly. Fairly simple, nondescript brew.
Sharps Eden Pure Ale;Rock, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sharp's Brewery (Molson Coors);Bottle @ Eden Project. Amber with thin head. Smells like stale bread and is slightly metallic. Caramel malts predominate. Is thin and boring with dull, cardboard flavors. Dull unfinished wood flavors. Not so good, quite disappointing.
Sharps Eden Pure Ale;Rock, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sharp's Brewery (Molson Coors);Pours a viscous looking, hazed over orange chestnut body. Bubbles rise in loose streams, the head a lapse, soppy off-white mess that legs well. Muddled mix of toffee, almonds, fresh-baked, salty bread and hay on the nose. Very soft in the mouth, little to no fizz, well rounded medium-light body. Toasted grains, caramelised sugars, wood, some praline without the aided sweetness. Dry, malty swallow shows some wood, soft tannins and a very subtle hint of peppery noble hops. Not much bitterness, little esters to bring it out of being just a little weighted by the malt. Not bad, just not the best from this brewer!! (50cL, BBE 05/11, Cellarbrations Kinross)
Sharps Eden Pure Ale;Rock, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sharp's Brewery (Molson Coors);bottle from Waitrose Sidmouth (08/2010). Clear amber-golden, intensive hoppy nose. Malty, slightly sourish fruity touch.
Sharps Eden Pure Ale;Rock, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sharp's Brewery (Molson Coors);Smelled like lager tasted plain and english boring but drinkable nothing special blah blah blah
Sharps Eden Pure Ale;Rock, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sharp's Brewery (Molson Coors);Bottle. Pours with a light copper body, and a thick off white head with loads of carbonation. The aroma is fresh hops, little bit of malt in the background. The taste is a very malty profile with some thick single flavour hops, light bitterness. A fair ale but pretty uninspiring.
Cottage Christmas Cracker;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Old Ale;Cottage Brewing;"Cask at the Cannie Man, Bracknell. Pale copper with a loose white hrad; the aroma has a touch of farmyard about it, but the taste is cleaner; soft and malty with some caramel and an earthy body; then there�s a dry finish with some lingering malts."
Cottage Christmas Cracker;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Old Ale;Cottage Brewing;Cask at the Druids Head in Kingston. Smooth, malty session beer with nut and malt. Fine but boring.

Cottage Christmas Cracker;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Old Ale;Cottage Brewing;A Mes rate. Cask at the Bree Louise. Mid amber colour with a thin off white head. Excellent condition but it is still failing to impress. Sweet fruity malt, loads of bread and a definite wheaty note in the finish leaving a biscuit hint in the aftertaste. Pretty standard stuff and far from exciting.
Cottage Christmas Cracker;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Old Ale;Cottage Brewing;Cask at The Market Porter, Borough, 17/12/07. Amber in colour. Aroma is fruity. Decent balance of malt and hops and the right mouthfeel for the strength. Decent beer but no more.

Gerbeaud Barna;Budapest, Hungary;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Gerbeaud;Keg at Gerbeaud, Budapest. Black beer with a tan head. Thin swettish malty beer with a nutty mild character. A certain tinny flavour throughout. Groundsy finish.
Gerbeaud Barna;Budapest, Hungary;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Gerbeaud;Sampled draught at the brewpub. In the cellar of this caf�/fine bakery in the midst of Budapest's shopping district you'll find a small brewery. Their darker beer is a fine German style schwarzbier. It comes brown/black and very hazy, has nice rich roasty aroma and thick, malty mouthfeel. Loads of black malt, gives coffee flavoiur and a hit of metal. A warning though. This beer can trick you into believe that you are in Bavaria.
Gerbeaud Vil�gos;Monor, Hungary;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Ilzer S�rgyar;Draught at Gerbeaud, Budapest, Hungary. Clear pale golden colour with big frothy white head. Grassy hops and balancing malt in aroma. Malty flavour with some grassy bitterness. Very watery. Expensive and disappointing.
Gerbeaud Vil�gos;Monor, Hungary;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Ilzer S�rgyar;On tap at the so called Gerbeaud Brewpub in Budapest. Pours clear golden with a small white head. Weak malty grain aroma. Taste is bitter, astringent even, not intended by the brewer I assume. This beer had seen its better days on tap. Watery mouthfeel, and a weak sweet aftertaste. No carbonation, dead-gone-bye bye.
Gerbeaud Vil�gos;Monor, Hungary;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Ilzer S�rgyar;On draught at Gerbeaud in Budapest (as Gerbeaud Superior). The beer is a clear golden color with a medium thin and fluffy white head that diminishes steadily. Strings of lacing. Light malt and hops aroma.

Gerbeaud Vil�gos;Monor, Hungary;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Ilzer S�rgyar;Sampled at the Gerbeaud brewpub in Budapest. I�ll echo what others have said below - this place was pricey! I only dared have a half of this before shipping out. Golden beer, quite smooth. Sweetish flavour, with cereal and banana malt. Verging on heavy and cloying. 1 beer on tap = 1 beer not much cop.
Gerbeaud Vil�gos;Monor, Hungary;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Ilzer S�rgyar;Keg at Gerbeaud Budapest. Pale straw colour, highly carbonated. Musty aroma, wet cardboard with a wheat malt note. The worst beer sampled in Hungary, which says much.
Gerbeaud Vil�gos;Monor, Hungary;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Ilzer S�rgyar;This has to be one of the worst brewpubs I have ever been. One beer on tap (06/04) at about 5 times the price of regular beer in Hungary and the beer sucks! Pale piss color, thin head, grassy nose. The body is all over the place and no where at all, but some pineapple notes jump in there somewhere. crap. Then it finishes dry. and then I get the bill that makes me wanna get high. Don�t waste your time at this place.
Harbor City Harvest Wheat;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Harbor City Brewing Company;12oz bottle(5/01)-A golden body with a nice white head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma of malt and really no Wit characteristics in the aroma. Taste a bit bready and doughy with a slight hop flavor which again are not characteristics of a belgian wit. Doesn�t match style. How does this meet a wit style when they brew a wit?

Aroma contains some light molasses with some sharp fruit. A very smooth palate again (big ups for the H&G), more molasses flavours, but nice and light - not too rich. And though the finish was a little sharp, overall this is delicious.

Redfish Daisy Cutter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;Sweet soy sauce aroma, tea, rice. Light medium brown with small off-white lacing head. Medium light carb with medium-heavy soft body. Malty but not overly sweet. Low, mild hoppiness. A bit of spicyness. Had aftertaste of Nori (seaweed used in sushi)!?

Redfish Daisy Cutter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Redfish New Orleans Brewhouse;"Nice brown hue; fairly clear. Gentle, lasting head. Pleasurable mouthfeel: creamy and smooth malts up front with a spikey carbonation in the middle and a dryish, flavorful finish. Clean, tasty and lasting aftertaste has an interesting spiciness to it.

Very well-hidden alcohol, considering it's about 11%. Beautiful stuff, especially for a brewpub. Brian needs to start making this year-round and getting Rockies Brewing or someone else to bottle it.
BJ's Grand Cru;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Bjs brews up a Belgian holiday classic. Banana, orange, lemon and clove nose mixes seemlessly with bready yeast. Thick, lightly hazy amber with a wisp of head. Heavy body but still in balance despite the high malt content. Spicy notes from the yeast add character to the fade, and clove seems to increase in intensity. At 10%, it warms, but is not overly hot. Nicely done.
BJ's Grand Cru;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On tap at local BJ'S restaurant...good beer, but not great...smooth balanced taste but not one of my go to beers.

The nose was fruitiness as a blend of orange & lemon, slight banana, Belgian yeast spiciness and subtle, Tripel-like phenols. Medium bodied, with okay carbonation, and light silkiness to the texture, the taste was somewhat similar notes, with more fruitiness, comfortably integrated alcohol, and some finishing dryness. A year of cellaring worked well.

Nose has no hint of the alky content within. First taste is somewhat boozy but more behaved than expected. Not in yer face like so many other so called grand crues.

There's an element of spocy yeast and sone dried fruits too. The sharness is a negative. The beer needs more sweetness and more body.

Clear deep blueberry red, small foamy slightly pink head, recedes slowly, ; sweet fruity aroma, raspberries, cherries, bubblegum, cinnamon; taste heavy sweet, light sour touch, fruity (cherries, raspberries), sugary, hint of wood, long duration, sweet finish, fruity and cinnamon notes; light body, sticky texture, soft carbonation; what to say a real fruit beer but by a far cry from classic kriek, nevertheless ok, could be a nice replacement for a kir as an aperitif."
De Bie Kriekedebie;Wakken, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij de Bie;"At Bruges Beer Fest. Pours dark red with a pink head, cute. The aroma contains cherries, of course, candy, sugar, raisins and dough. It tastes heavy sweet with a light acidic, dry finish, and a slight metallic undertone. Syrupy texture. Not a regular cherry beer. Quite good, probably a case of ""love it or hate it""."
De Bie Kriekedebie;Wakken, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij de Bie;Rood bier met heel veel schuim. Smaak is niet zoet, echter ietwat chemisch en lijkt weinig op kriek. Valt tegen.
De Bie Kriekedebie;Wakken, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij de Bie;Bottle . Pours very dark and deep red .. Purple, actually . Big white head . Smell is very unintense . Some cherries , but also malty sweetness . Taste is sweet ( captain obvious ) . Cherries are way less intense than other fruitbeers ( this one is actually quite in balance ) , malty sweetness . Filthy , arteficial sweetness only comes very late and doesnt build up TOO high . Quite OK actually . Good mouthfeel and carbo as well
De Bie Kriekedebie;Wakken, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij de Bie;Top-fermented sweet cherry beer with thick, dense, rocky, lightly pinkish, collapsing head and deep fuchsia red colour, hazy. Sweet cherries, apple sauce and raisins in the nose, some cake, some liquorice, unfortunately overshadowed by chemical solvents reminiscent of rubber or even plastic. Sweet fruit taste on a soft malt base, retronasally that plastic thing again, disappearing quickly only to make place for a very sugary, syrupy, sticky, way too saturating sweetness as in over-sugared cough syrup. With all my sympathy for this brewery, this is absolutely not enjoyable in any way.
Vermont Pub Odziozo Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a tad of brown color with a light amber hues running about. Bar pour�s kind of slim white foamy head that dissipated immediately. No lacing. The aroma has some of the normal qualities of a Brown ale with some stale bready notes. The flavor leans to dry roasted nuts and then some sweet toffee malts. Long sweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat light bodied. Decent sessionability about it. Low carbonation. Overall, not really much to say, but crushable is a word not normally associated with brown ales, not sure if I would come back to.
Vermont Pub Odziozo Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Old Jug Brown Ale. Just your basic Vermont amber with a little raosted malt thrown in just to call it something else. Muzzlehatch, I feel your pain dude. Just move out of the region.
Vermont Pub Odziozo Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Malty toasted caramel nose. Small off-white head caps light brown/coppery colored ale. Lightly sweet with watery finish.
Vermont Pub Odziozo Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"There is really little to say about this one; as uninspiring a brown ale (one of my favorite styles, sometimes) as you are likely to come across, very weak and thin and without enough malt OR hops. One of those beers that make you think ""I had to go to a brewpub to get THIS?"" Almost all of the VPBs other offerings are fortunately much better."

Porterhouse Chiller;Dublin, Ireland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Porterhouse Brew Co.;A pint in the porterhouse. Pours clear golden , looks very unappealing. A small white lacy head which hardly does the job. Fresh grainy aroma and it actually tastes better than it looks. Medium carbonated with fresh and earthy feel. An average simple beer which is thirst quenching but not more than that.
Porterhouse Chiller;Dublin, Ireland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Porterhouse Brew Co.;Draught in Bray. Light yellow, almost like a white wine. Aroma of grainy malt. Flavour is malt and grain, a little metal. Years since I drank one of these, always remembered it as being better than this, nostalgia and all that I suppose.
Porterhouse Chiller;Dublin, Ireland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Porterhouse Brew Co.;The beer has a simple look. The color of the beer is a perfect golden yellow.The beer is a little pale. It�s crystal clear, making it possible to look straight trough the beer. On top of the beer there is a rather small layer of rough white foam, which collapses quickly. The smell of the beer is mild, but quite nice. It has a creamy touch to it. There are some nice fruity hops present. The bulk of the smell is malty. The taste of the beer is better, and even quite nice. It has a strong malty flavour. There is also that slight creamy sensation that was also there in the smell. There is also a nice touch of strawberry in the taste. It has a distinct porterhouse aroma going on, maybe something to do with the yeast. It is a very nice lager beer.

Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can (Old Notes)-Pours golden with a small head. Aroma of corn, grains, and cereal. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is not bad.
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Originally rated June 2005. Mountain fresh taste since 1878... written on the can. Sounds good. Clear golden colour with clean malt scent. Not much retention in the head, but lace is found. After breathing, the malt is no longer felt through the nose, but a wiff of alcohol. Not much in the taste as well. Smooth, clean and slight malt. Hardly any bitterness. Not much found in this beer.... a slight notch over Coors light... but with a 5.9% ABV.
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;355ml can pours a pale golden color with a 2 finger white head that settles leaving a few spots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is light grains and hops. Taste is light malt sweetness with a moderate hop bitterness which finishes dry. Another average macro lager.
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours a light golden yellow. Aromas of minor hops, corn, grains. Flavor is light, crisp, watery with a little hop and not much else.
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;As the International Night of Swill wore on, I found myself becoming less and less interested in writing grand funny informative reviews. Take this for example: pale yellow, very carbonated and crisp, not overly skunky, just boring. Crap lager, bad. See?
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Single can from the LCBO. Pours a pale yellow body with a thin and short lived white head. Lots of lacing here, but almost too much as it almost overcoats the glass. Aromas are crab apples, faint malt, the slightest amount of hops, and herbs. Taste is sour apples, faint malt ands hops, some grassy tastes, and tin. Dry and biter finish. Better than a lotof macros, but nothing exceptional.
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. INoS. Embodies the very pale yellow colour I have come to expect from this evening. Small fluffy white head. Cereally muted aroma. Sweet very slight bitterness. Fairly inoffensive . Average palate, bit thin. In the land of the smelly and foul the neutral and least obnoxious is king.
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Beer #14 in the line-up at The International Night Of Swill. Pale yellow with a small white head. Light bodied. Flavour is watery, bland, inoffensive - boring as hell.
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Lighter golden with collapsing head. Faint corn aroma with metallic note. Hypercarbonated. Sweet corn water with metallic notes (hops) and not much else. Cant finish this hooch, gives me gas.
Rainier Dry;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Light gold in colour. Horrible corn aroma, with some wet cardbord and stale hops. Flavour had a very disturbing sweetness, quite grainy with some creamed corn. Finished with a metallic crapiness. I�ve never had more fun pouring a beer down the drain.
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Like Olympia, had from can at 5 Point Cafe in Seattle. Much better than Olympia. Very clean, refreshing, good mouthfeel. Balanced, not terribly watery even though light. I wish I could come back and have more.
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Bottle: Poured a golden color lager with a medium size white foamy head with limited retention. Aroma of adjunct notes with light residual sugar notes. Taste is also dominated by adjunct notes with some residual sugar notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Another adjunct based lager but still refreshing after a long day of hiking.
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Pinky G�s Pizza in Jackson, Wyoming. Pour was clear golden, foamy white head. Aroma of grain, adjuncts. Taste was mild sweet, malty, watery, corn/grain, adjuncts.
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"A smooth beer without tasting or feeling watered down or tasting bitter. The can in the picture doesn't look like the standard beer can. I probably prefer regular Rainier beer over any lighter beer that I have had in recent memory, all of which were either bitter or weak or watery. Another favorite beer was Hakim Stout, which is not stout-y, but it seemed to have changed in the past year; it can be found at some Ethiopian restaurants, sometimes even if it is not on the drinks menu. I am not much of a beer drinker, and have a hard time drinking any because of the bitterness."
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12 oz. can, bought randomly at Coaltrain. Pours a clear, straw color, with a medium, fizzy, white head. The aroma is white bread, rosewater, butterscotch, and light pine wood. Sweet and malty, with a mild bitterness. Light body, with a crisp, grainy, and effervescent mouthfeel. This is a simple and surprisingly pleasant lager. Unoffensive, very lightly hopped, and refreshing. I'm surprised to say that this would probably be one of my top choices for a truly cheap beer.
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;473ml can. thanks Devyn. Pours a clear pale gold with a good-lasting head. Aroma is light fruity and moreso nondescript. Washes down like nothing, typical pabst/
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Aroma escaso. Malteada, predominantemente dulce, con contrapunto ligeramente especiado. Gas moderado. Bebible.
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Rainier has a thick, white head, a mostly clear, straw, bubbly appearance, and decent glass lacing. The aroma is of mild, sweet grain, with some paper. Taste is similar, and bitterness is herbal. The mouthfeel is light to medium, and Rainier finishes crisp and easy going. Too bad, but my can was over one month past the ""best by"" date. RJT"
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Blik 50cl in Seattle. Licht zoet, bittertje. (9-2016).--------------------.
Rainier;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Drank it on a peak over looking Rainier and in bars. Good solid grain beer.
Strohs Bohemian Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Brassy gold color with small bubbles and a slight white head. Fresh hoppy nose with some sweet maltiness. Mild malty flavor upfront. Thin bodied and highly carbonated.
Strohs Bohemian Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Back in the day this beer was on par with some of todays Czech beers. But not any more. Now it has less hop flavor and lower quality hop flavor. With a chemical metallic taste thrown in. If someone offers you one by all means drink it. But don�t buy it, not worth it.
Strohs Bohemian Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Eh, maybe not the best beer, but it will get you hammered. I actually found one recently at Corridor Liquors in Laurel. Mostly corn in the nose, but watery & bland all the same.
Strohs Bohemian Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;this is/was the ultimate hippie beer of the seventies. battle ships could be floated on the amount of it that was consumed by my crew. then the lable went from silver to gold and it wasn�t as good. i remained true, then the lable turned blue, and i bailed. if you�ve been around long enough you could remember eight 16 oz bottles fof 99cents. it was a good old beer.
Strohs Bohemian Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;12 oz. can brewed by Stroh�s Brewing Co., Detroit, Michigan. God only knows how long I�ve had this can laying around. One of the benefits of being a beer can collector is drinking the duplicates! Better than the regular Stroh�s. Deeper gold with a decent white head. A bit fizzy. Skunky aroma when the can was opened, which is to be expected given how long the can was sitting around. Still, quite drinkable. More pronounced malt and hops than their current offering.
Strohs Bohemian Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Has considerably more body than regualr Strohs but still no more flavor.....
Strohs Bohemian Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;sorry im a strohs aholic....................................................
Strohs Bohemian Style;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;No it's not. Maybe a fuller body than regular Strohs but this is still bland, watery drek.
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;It has a light foamy white head that fades quickly to a thin wispy covering and then down to nothing. There is not much in the way of lacing, just a few slick spots at the top of the glass. The body has a bright golden color with very good clarity and some visible carbonation. The aroma is light and has hints of grassy hops, light husky grain and cooked vegetables. Its flavor has a fairly dry grainy, corn and husky malt taste with some grassy hops. The finish is dry with mild bitterness and acidity as well as an odd salty mineral like thing. The body is light to medium with a light easy drinking texture and light fizzy carbonation.
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle - thanks Brandon. Pale hazy orange amber pour with a smaller head. Slightly sweet. Low flavor - pretty dull beer.
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Aroma is bread and malt spice. The flavor is mildly artificially sweet malts and malt spice into the finish
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Purchased as part of the Beers of America Historical Collection, contract brewed from original recipes. Nothing special at all here, nice golden color, no head and light lacing. Flavor is so light it�s almost non-existent. Reminds me of an American macro-brew from the 70�s, which is not a good thing....
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Mild lemon, yeast, and grain aroma. Golden with thin white head. Full bodied lager, grain, mild hop note, and hint of caramel. Balanced, mild dry bitterness. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Very light clear golden body with a thin white head. Moderate lacing. Aroma of grass and perfume. Taste was light malt and hops but very thin on the palate. Easy to drink.
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Light wheat colored pour very clear a full soapy head and vicious carbonation throughout. Palate is much to thin (watery). Aroma of some sweet grains a hint of bread fades quickly. Taste is light sweet grains, very basic lager w/ a little extra sweetness. A simple easy to drink, unoffensive beer.
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle. Pours a lively, deep gold yellow with a nice white head. Aroma is corn-fed and corn-roasted malt with buttery hops and floral bread. Flavor is corny lemon, zesty malt, and buttered biscuit. Lively and tingly on the tongue. No corn? Sure about that?
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pale lager colored. Smells like chemicals and adjuncts and some malt. Taste is malt and water. Thin and yucky, a lasting yucky.
Rock River Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Golden clear. Doesnt hold a white head. Bland, chemically laden aroma. Harsh mouthfeel and bite that lasts well after the finish. Heavy malt taste.
Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;The body has a medium brownish/red color with a very clear appearance and visible carbonation. On top is a thin white head that quickly fades out to just a wispy thin ring of bubbles that makes no lacing at all. Its aroma has hints of lightly roasted sweet malt and metallic/salty minerals with a touch of leafy hops. There is a big buttery grain flavor with some lighter hints of roasted malt. The malt up front has modest sweetness is lightly balanced by some mineral/leafy hop flavor and mild bitterness. Into the finish there are some citrus orange peel and salty metallic notes.

Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle from Brandon - thanks. Deep cola pour with a small head. Mild caramel sweetness. Quite watery. Bleh.
Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;Aroma is nutty malts with an off edge to them. The flavor is nutty malts and a hint of fruit in the finish.
Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;Catch up rating from notes, 2012: Bottle from American Heritage Beer collection picked up at Ramstein Shopette. Pours out a dark, but clear brown, small bubbly head which soon subsides. Aroma is dark malts, hint of bitter chocolate. Taste is mildly sweet, without a lot of the bitterness normally found in the style. Beer seems watery, thin. Kind of a bit off to my taste, but supposedly brewed from a historical recipe.
Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;Lots of sugar taste. Very dark brown color, no head. Great mellow porter, no hop notes. The label had no bar code and said 1996, not sure the date was correct. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;Wonderful toasty flavor with nut characteristics. Would expect to have a heavy aftertaste but does not. Would pair well with a sweet desert such as gingerbread cookies.
Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;Dark amber, off white head, and lite lacing. Mild dark fruit, lite roast, and lite hop aroma. Full bodied, zippy carbonation, mild roast, mild caramel, Mild lemon flavor. Medium malt start and dry bitter finish . ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;Sweet, maple syrup thin. Wow just not that great. How did they get this stuff in Arizona? No hops, to sweet... DONT GET THIS
Piedmont Porter;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Porter;Minhas Craft Brewery;Nothing redeemable here. Watery, sour excuse for a porter. No flavor you would find in a traditional porter (roast, coffee, chocolate). I drank half of it and poured the rest out.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;12oz bottle. Poured an amber color with a smaller sized head. Some fruitiness and caramel.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;It has a fast fading, light fluffy head. It is bright white in color and full of big soapy bubbles. There is only some slick spotty lace here and there but not all that much to speak of really. The body is light golden honey colored and very clear. It has lots of visible in the beer and some big bubbles that stick to the inside of the glass. The aroma has a touch of leafy hops with some lemony citrus as well. Also there are notes of sweet bready malt and dry pale grain. The flavor has light grain, sweet white bread and some fruity orange marmalade notes as well as some sweet honey and buttery tones. There is very little bitterness and just a hint of citrus hop flavor. The finish is more of an acidic hop flavor vs. citrus hop bitterness. The texture is very smooth with a medium body and mellow carbonation.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle from Brandon - thanks. Murky light amber pour with a smaller head. Light sweet malt with some metal in here. Not good at all.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;Nice foamy white head with decent retention and good lacing sits atop a golden, borderline amber body which is clear and lightly bubbly. Musty vegetable aroma. Honestly smells like a lightly used shoe, not bad but definitely not good. Not hoppy, not malty, kind of yammy, a descriptor I tend to use for crappy, old, or old crappy beers. Up front it�s really generic and light in flavor, balance is far towards malt. Tastes like it was brewed ages ago which ironic considering it came from a package of antique styles, maybe they literally found some old ass beer. A hint of hops at the end, not as much as a vegetable flavor as I�ve experienced in some brews but still quite odd. M/D - Light to moderate body. Drinkable. What I�ve learned from this variety pack so far. Old beer all tastes the same, and old.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bread-like through out, similar to a basic lager. Drinkable enough but not very flavorful.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;Aroma of sweet malt and honey with floral aromatics. Slight honey taste and light bittering hops. Crisp light aftertaste.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pours a nice clear amber with an average white head that leaves some good lacing. Aroma has a malty core with grassy, caramel and fruity hints. Malty flavor includes a bit of hops, a bit of apple and pear, and a bit of caramel - nice, if nothing to Tweet about. Smooth texture has good fizz and decent body. Better as a party drink, or to go with a meal.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;Golden with white head. Grain and mild hop aroma note. Full bodied, creamy texture, grain, lemon, and corn notes. Unbalanced, lasting hop bitter finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;12 fl oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Copper with no head to speak of. Aroma is raisins and apples. Bitterness up front, then the fruitiness comes in. A ton of bitterness in the lasting finish. A lot of carbonation, surprising considering the minuscule head. Decent.
Berkshire Springs Stock Ale;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle: Poured a golden with white head. Aroma is sweet malt. Taste is sweet malt and barely, light fruit mixed in as well.
Barbary Coast Gold Rush Style Beer;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Minhas Craft Brewery;It has an amber colored body with some visible carbonation. The head on top is light, fluffy and tall. It is off white in color and it is slows to fade, leaving some spotty lacing on the glass as I drink. The aroma is full of lemony citrus and leafy hops with sweet candy like sweet malt flavors underneath. Also I am picking up a light mineral like presence. The flavor has leafy and mineral hop notes are up first with some smooth buttery notes mixed in. It has sweet honey and caramel maltiness in the middle and the finish has moderate hop bitterness and lemony/orange citrus hops as well as more odd mineral notes. Overall this flavor notes seem rather light and a bit boring for the style. It has a light to medium body with lively, almost fizzy carbonation.
Barbary Coast Gold Rush Style Beer;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle shared by Brandon. Wow, this is shitty. Amber pour. Semi-sweet crap all the way around. Meh.
Barbary Coast Gold Rush Style Beer;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Minhas Craft Brewery;Aroma is thin, sweetish malts. The flavor is nutty malts, artificial flavoring and a semi-sweet finish.

Barbary Coast Gold Rush Style Beer;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Minhas Craft Brewery;Amber body. White head that leaves instantly. No lacing. Smell is of a very small amount of soy sauce and vegetable soup. Taste is blah. Some malt with sour fruit. Palate is way too watery. Overall I honestly can say I won�t ever drink this again....actually I kind of want to drain pour this but hate the thought of wasted alcohol makes me sad. I hate these tough choice of life!

Barbary Coast Gold Rush Style Beer;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Minhas Craft Brewery;Ewww...this one tastes a little rotten. Predominant flavor of apple. Rancid egg like smell. Weak, sour aftertaste. Watery texture. Came in a gift pack so I hope the other 11 are better than this.
Barbary Coast Gold Rush Style Beer;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Minhas Craft Brewery;Clear amber. Small white head. Aroma of caramel, soap, and adjuncts. Tastes the same, with water. Thin, phony, and boring.
City Steam Brown Sugar;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;City Steam Brewery;On tap @ City Steam. Pours dark brown with a small white head. Nose is dark malt, roast, and some sweet, earthy coffee. Flavor is roast and sweetness with a touch of coffee bitterness. Some bitterness sticks around for finish. Light bodied and pretty good.
City Steam Brown Sugar;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;City Steam Brewery;on tap-pours a creamy brown head that laces with brown color. Aroma is dark malt, chocolate. Taste is dark malt, chocolate, coffee. A light sharpness, vinegar like, without the taste. Medium body.
City Steam Brown Sugar;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;City Steam Brewery;These guys seem to like making stouts. Unfortunately, every one seems to fall a bit shorty of the mark. Pours dark brown with a light brown creamy head. Smells of raisins and chocolate. Tastes of cocoa and earthy hops. Finishes watery.
City Steam Brown Sugar;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;City Steam Brewery;An overall nice sweet stout: body is fairly light in a creamy way, a great match for the flavor, which is sweet but not overly so, just enough to earn its title. A little bit of chocolate flavor, tempered by something lighter. Felt lively on the tongue, but not so much that it ruined it.
City Steam Brown Sugar;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;City Steam Brewery;Pint at brewpub. Advertised as a Jamaican Brown Sugar stout. Sweet chocolate aroma with vanilla aromas and a few hints of anise. Rather sweet aroma that is pleasant. I also detect a little coffee in the aroma as well. Nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a small tan head that is quickly dissipating. Carbonated, roasty chocolate flavors are present early on, which turn a little sweeter as time goes on. Even though this is brewed with brown sugar, it is not as sweet as I expected. Some anise is present in the end with a mild bitter hoppiness. This beer is too carbonated and the lack of head is disappointing. Other than that, the flavor and aroma are nice.
City Steam Brown Sugar;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;City Steam Brewery;Dark brown with a thick tan head that leaves a nice sheet of lace. Aroma of roasted malts and brown sugar. Thinnish body, dry stout flavor despite the burnt sugar sweetness. Roasted, black malt and cocoa malt flavors. Thin but nicely flavored and adequately hopped.

City Steam The Devil and 67 Virgins;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Old Ale;City Steam Brewery;Whiskey colored with a minimal edge head. Low carbonation. Rye aroma with some sweetness and liquorice. Very bourbon-like in its flavor, with loads of whiskey malt and rye bitterness. Liquorice flavor emerges as well, although light and unobtrusive. Lightly cloying as well. Very interesting and a tasty winter whiskey sipper.
Sunnybrook Pale Ale;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);A nice pale ale. Very hoppy, with a nice malt presence. Straw colored, with medium head and lacing. The finish is smooth and hoppy, with floral and citrus overtones.
Sunnybrook Pale Ale;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);Lacked the real bitterness usually associated with pale ales, and didn't keep a good head, but still a good, clean, refreshing ale
Sunnybrook Oktoberfest;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);"Very nice fest. Orangish-amber in color, with a nice head. Very malty, with strong (but not overpowering) hop presence. Finish is smooth, with hints of caramel, toffee, and blush wine. Instead of a black and tan, I get this with vanilla porter or stout floated on top and call it a ""Halloween black and orange"". It looks great!"
Sunnybrook Oktoberfest;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);Lacked a real robust flavor, didn't keep a good head at all, but not a bad marzen.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Bottle. Slightly hazy yellow pour with a smaller white head. Very sweet nose - like honey and dough maybe, but I�m struggling for the right descriptor. Lighter palate. Taste isn�t all that good - adjunct-lager with more character than BMC, but several steps below decent brews.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Pours a pale golden color with no head but lots of carbonation. Light smell of malts. Tastes of malts, is a bit watered down and slightly bitter aftertaste.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden with a medium white head. Aroma is grain with some malt. Taste is grain, malt, some hops, and a little sweet. Light bodied with generous carbonation. Not a bad pale lager.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;12oz bottle 7/8/09 (Siciliano�s Market-Grand Rapids)-Pours a golden body with a nice small white head. Aroma of malt, grains, and hops. Taste of the same but much tastier than your basic Pale Lager. This light bodied brew is quite refreshing and quite tasty.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Straw yellow white a white foamy head. Next to no nose, some sweetness to it. Taste of corn, overly sweet malt with an astringent body. Yeah, all the benefits of a pale lager that the GP seems to love.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Smell is standard issue budweiser fare: a bit corny and a tad malty. Quite golden with big puffy white head. Flavor also slighty better than standard swill, but not much. Corn city. Fairly bad beer from a good brewer.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;"Crystal-clear, golden color, big, fluffy, pristine white head, perfect fit for a lager. Aroma, some hops, bright and floral, but a bit soapy, growing sweet, smellish cornish...wonder what adjuncts are at play here? Okay, I�ll play nice...but it is ""corny""... Taste: clean, brisk, almost crisp, then fading quick. Very refreshing, highly downable, tastes pretty decent, actually. Not too much flavor, but it doesn�t taste bad, and almost squeaky clean. I though this would be an empty, hollow, even unpleasant experience, and I�m a Schell�s fan...silly me, it�s a nice lager, nothing but. I�d never choose it against many of my favorites, but I can imagine this being quite a nice alternative in many Minnesota/Midwest locations where the only other options are Bud, High Life and the like. Yeah, I can drink these, and it�s not bad for $4.97 a 6�er! (At that�s at an expensive downtown Mpls shop, must be cheapo outside of the cities.)"
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle, courtesy of csbosox. Pour is a very clear, very pale yellow with a bubbly one inch white head. Aroma of chemical sweetness, some dusty hops and corn. Taste is fairly in-offensive, really not much flavor here to speak of. Get the standard Pale Lager components, with perhaps just a kiss of hops to wake things up. Very thin palate. As it warmed, the corn really started to feature, and the enjoyment waned. This one was fine, and is probably a step up from the macro Pale Lagers, but its not a real big step. Thanks Chris, always love to try Schells.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Bottle, I enjoyed the sampler pack so much, that I though I should get the orignal pale lager that Schell produces. Pours like any pale lager, nice sweet flavor, a decent beer all around that my mother enjoys.
Schell Original;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;August Schell Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of csbosox. Pours a crystal clear pale gold with a frothy white head. The aroma is dusty and lightly fruity malt with a sweet corn note in the background. Light bodied and effervescent with a clean, crisp finish. Light, sweet malt and faint corn, this pale has just a hint of the adjunct and metallic bite that I get from most macros. While I haven�t tried a lot of pale lagers recently, I�d have to say that this is one of the best examples of the style that I�ve tried. Thanks again, Chris!

Very clean on lager flavors with minimal yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, lightly creamy/bready, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice.

Lawson Creek Vanilla Cream Stout;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Flavored;Cold Spring Brewery;12 oz. bottle. Who knows how long my parents have had this sitting in their pantry? Dark brown color with a thin, off white head. Good amount of lacing. Sweet vanilla aroma with some roasted malts. Thin mouthfeel, just a bit watery. Flavor isn�t all that great. Just the slightest hint of the vanilla without any typical stout characteristics. Grainy, bready finish. Not good at all.
Lawson Creek Vanilla Cream Stout;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Flavored;Cold Spring Brewery;Didn�t really stand out to me. Solid vanilla and roasted notes in both aroma and flavor, but pretty weak and bland otherwise. Too thin bodied for a stout. Not horrible, not great
Lawson Creek Vanilla Cream Stout;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Flavored;Cold Spring Brewery;"Basically, I didn�t like anything about this brew. I thought it was supposed to be a stout. So why so light on the color? And the flavor? I didn�t really appreciate it as much as I had hoped. Everything fades off the palate within a second. With a labeling like ""Vanilla Cream"", there could be so many ways to go. Unfortunately, it doesn�t deliver anything I feel like it should."

Lawson Creek Vanilla Cream Stout;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Flavored;Cold Spring Brewery;Rated 3/21/06: I normally rate a beer more on it�s own overall qualities rather than the qualities based on the respective style, but in this case I gotta rate lower for the simple reason that this beer is not even close to being a stout. If this beer was a dunkel I would have given it higher marks, although not much higher. Pours a darkish transparent amber color with a thick tan head. The head ultimately shrinks to a thin film, and there is moderate lacing. The aroma is sweet with an overly generous hint of vanilla. The mouthfeel is thin and slightly creamy. I enjoyed the flavor of this brew at first but it started to get weaker and nastier the more I drank. Although watered down the sweet malts and vanilla flavoring made their presence known. I would have prefered that the flavor be fuller and much maltier, that is where this beer falls short specfically for selling itself as a cream stout. For a stout it�s got some major issues.
Lawson Creek Vanilla Cream Stout;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Flavored;Cold Spring Brewery;Dark brown, nearly black. Not much aroma. Slightly sweet. Not much flavor. Rather bland.

Good taste and low ABV make this a nice sessioner.
Lawson Creek Vanilla Cream Stout;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Flavored;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours an odd color for a stout, golden brown with a white head. Very little aroma except for some vanilla and roastedness. The flavor is weak with some roastedness and mild vanilla.
Lawson Creek Vanilla Cream Stout;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Flavored;Cold Spring Brewery;Small head and very light aroma. Least stouty stout I�ve ever had, wouldn�t even call it a stout. Vanilla is light, tastes more like vanilla cream soda than beer. Very dissapointed.

Affligem Paters Vat Christmas;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Bottle from 1999!!? Aged 14 years? What? Good grief.

Maritime Pacific Navigator Dark Weizen Bock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;Tap at brouwers. Poured almost black with a tan head and great lacing. Roasted wheat aroma. Sweet with lots of dark fruit, but no banana, which I expected. The flavor is also sweet and roasted with good dark wheat notes and pleasant fruitiness. Big creamy body with some warming aspects. Reminded me more of a dopplebock than a wheat beer, but was fantastic nonetheless.
Maritime Pacific Navigator Dark Weizen Bock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;On tap at Collins Pub. Damn, it looks like this fine brew hasn�t been around for a while. Very dark brown, almost black. Smells like bananas split sundae with hints of molassess. Thick, rich malty mouth. Molassess, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, cherries, brandy, truffles notes. Very rich bock like. Lingering rich dark chocolate finish. Yum.
Maritime Pacific Navigator Dark Weizen Bock;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Maritime Pacific Brewing Co.;I'm very confused...the mixture of espresso malts and sweet spices is leaving an unshakable flavor of rotten pineapple in my mouth. My friends seemed to like it so it wasn't skunked, but there was definitely something amiss here. The dusty caramel malt so inherent in dark bock-type beers seems to be a bit aggressive, almost like dark chocolate - but not well rounded at all. I think this beer could use some serious recipe tweaking.

Hanlon's Port Stout;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Stout;Hanlon's Brewery;Dark coloured port stout with a slim white head, smells smoky and roasted.

Hanlon's Port Stout;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Stout;Hanlon's Brewery;Cask at Beer Cellar Exeter pours a nearly opaque black with some soapy, creamy, lacing white head. Nose is cool, black tea, toast, some mild smoke, lightly meaty. Flavor is tannic with black tea and acetic coffee, bread and pumpernickel, mild sausage/bacon, black licorice. Finishes dry and just lightly watery. Honestly, the complexity of an imperial stout with the character of a pub ale.
Hanlon's Port Stout;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Stout;Hanlon's Brewery;At the Moon under the Water in Watford. Pours a super dark brown with a loose tan head. The rich roasted malt, dark fruit, brown sugar. The taste is pretty much as it smells with a dry roasty end. Light/medium in body with fine carbonation.

F: big, egg-white, good retention. C: deep gold, light hazy. A: malty, grainy, grassy, bit wort.

Wychwood Scarecrow (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);500ml bottle Hazy amber with OK head. Malt vinegar aroma. Slight cardboard and metallic notes. Bit thin. Clean enough finish.
Wychwood Scarecrow (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);If I didn't know this was imported and organic, I would call it borderline swill. Labeled on the bottle as a golden ale, described here as ESB...I would best describe it as a pilsner. Flavor is grassy and corn. Kind of watery with a flatter feel. Mouthfeel is on the smoother side. Besides that, there is really nothing going on here.
Wychwood Scarecrow (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);500ml bottle. Pours clear golden colour, small white head. Aroma is malty, slightly hoppy, some lemongrass. Taste is malty, grassy, slightly hoppy, buttery. Light body, average carbonation. Quite bland and poor

Wychwood Scarecrow (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Seems I'm rating this rather higher than most people. But to me, it has that round, complete quality that characterises a premium bitter that actually works - an elusive type of balance. A dark golden brew with a good, deep malty nose. Perfectly dosed, juicey bitterness with gentle carbonation. A slightly citric finish that doesn't last forever. Traditional and ordinary (but not average!) in a sense that has become rare.

Dieu du Ciel! Ga�lique;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at DDC St-Jerome. This is my favorite beer from the many DDC beers I�ve tasted so far. The lovely nitro foam, the sweet (rosted) malt, light caramelized taste. I have to honestly reveal I�m enjoying that beer in a larger size glass than my regular one and I�m almost jumping in the air when I see this beer written on the board as being available on the premises. I feel it is an underdog beer among DDC customers.
Dieu du Ciel! Ga�lique;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Guest tap at Brasseurs de Montebello. Pours a freaking huge thick, creamy tan head and has a light amber appearance, quite clear. Aromas of toasted malts, hints of vanilla and caramel. Flavours are sweet malts, vanilla, toffee.

Thanks to the nitro there is almost no aroma, and the flavor too is muffled; behind that, there seem to be a nice Ale, with nice malt and caramel, decent hopping, and light fruity touch, both from the hops and from the esters. Not bad. Kill nitro."

Dieu du Ciel! Ga�lique;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at the brewery. Man this beer looks amazing. Pours a nice coppery gold with creamy beige cap that lasts FORVER and leaves great lacing. The smell is loaded with barnyard funk - exactly as it should be. Nose is dry cut hay/straw, with some roasted grain the background. There�s that sharp cow patty element typical of Irish cream/brown ales. Taste is all toasted grains, nuts and dried hay with a hint of spicy dryness on the finish. Good lord these guys are good

Closes with long lasting, warming sweet and coffee finish, has light to medium body and soft to average carbonation. Not bad by far, but actually not as good as I thought it would be.

Brutopia Powerfull Porter;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Porter;Brutopia - Brasseur Artisanal;On tap at the brewpub (26 nov 2004). Creamy light brown head. Dark brown colored body (not opaque). Average density appearance. Overwelming yeasty aroma that hides most others. Strange? Still you can perceive hints of chocolate. Weird yeasty flavor at first but interesting and good chocolate finish toward the end. Short chocolate feel. Too bad, it look like either there was a problem with the yeast or the beer has not been fermenting enough? Light body, dry texture, very soft carbonation. Substract the yeasty aroma and flavor you get a nice porter (which I used to enjoy a bit more before today).

Taste is slightly sweet with coffee, roasted malt, nuts, earthy/mineral notes and a light lactic presence (not disturbing - well integrated). Light body. Creamy mouthfeel. Very good Sweet Stout.

Courage 1945 Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Smiths (Heineken UK);27th June 2015: cheer Rich for bringing this 330ml bottle to the 2nd Annual Midlands tasting. Not at it�s best I suspect (well out of date): it poured a grubby amber with a wisp for a head. Aroma like a barley wine, the thin body having a sweet caramel flavour: disappointing, but the age didn�t help. Scored objectively and kindly.

Courage 1945 Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Old bottle, age uncertain, consumed at Kookfest, September 2006. Mid brown colour. Nothing much left apart from some caramel and sweet toffee. Any hops that were around at the outset have left the building. Very dull mouthfeel. Pretty unpalatable.
Courage 1945 Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Bottle. Sharp acidity, sweet caramel flavours. Mouthfeel is old and tired, and the sherry notes seemed to have gone a little too sour. Interesting to try these things anyway.

Courage 1945 Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Kook�s Farewell Bash. Toffee. Tobacco hops. Old notes. Not very interesting. It seems odd to revive such an ordinary beer - and the recipe is a bit suspect as during the war the abv of beers went down as supplies of barley were rationed.

Burtonwood Forshaws 67;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Stout;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);"Bottled. A top find from the vintage (""not for drinking"") bottle stall at GBBF, consumed at Kookfest, September 2006. Obviously old, but not clear how old. Reasonably, and surprisingly, drinkable too. Dark and sweet, with plenty of milky chocolate in evidence. It has certainly retained some flavour although the sweetness has survived better than any other elements so it does come over as a little sugary. Otherwise quite pleasant."
Burtonwood Forshaws 67;Burtonwood, Cheshire, England;Stout;Thomas Hardy Burtonwood (Molson Coors);Bottle. Black colour. This was pretty good for its age.

Fresh pint at Monk's Cafe for RR takeover with Vinnie, and Natalie. Pours a deep and luscious black color with a large beige head and tons of lacing.Nose and flavor are maybe the best porter I have had in the states: cocoa dust, perfectly roasted malt, coffee, earth, and pine.

Russian River Porter;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Porter;Russian River Brewing;July 27th, 2015 - I didn't know RR made a Porter until today, which even in this diminutive, thimble sized glass, has a nice frothiness to it. The scent has a distinct creamy and coffee type smell, and the mouthfeel is light. In fact, it might be too light, but while the mouthfeel needs a little more substance the flavor is a yummy reflection of rich and cocoa heavy brownie mix.

The head is thick and beige/tan, stays for a while. Lace is present and of the same color. The aroma show hints of malt, brown sugar, and coffee and some slight hints of chocolate as it warmed. The taste is of molasses and malt in the beginning, then fades slightly into a slight coffee and chocolate. It ends with a slight bitter taste. This is a good beer for this style.

Flavor is fantastic (I didn't find it thin at all, and I like big beers). Dry roastiness flavors are very apparent, as is a nice mouthfeel (flaked barley?). Hints of chocolate in the finish.

Founders Dirty Bastard Scotch Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"12 oz. bottle. AROMA: Very sweet, with scents of brown sugar and caramel. APPEARANCE: Pours an opaque, dark brown with a very frothy tan head that dissipates slowly with nice lacing. TASTE: It tastes a lot like it smells, sweet with notes of caramel, and a bit of black coffee on the backend. I don't really get any smoke or peat flavors, as the touted in the description. MOUTHFEEL: Has a nice, full body with a creamy-slick texture, and average carbonation. OVERALL: I like the style of beer, but this one is just a bit too much on the sweet side for me. I think if it had more smoke, peat, or coffee flavor to offset the sweetness, then it would be more to my liking. Having said that, I would never say ""no thanks"" if someone offered one to me."

App: hazy pale sparing white head. T/p: thin to med body with short sweet finish. Moderate carbonation. O: oh boy this aroma is so fake. Well it's smell like bold blueberry yogurt. I would have prefer an acidic finish.
Pump House Blueberry Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pump House Brewery;bottle - Pours clear gold and smells of, you guessed it, blueberries. The flavor is very sweet with malt and blueberry. It's light bodied and the blueberry flavor is decent, but this beer is just too sweet. Really underwhelming.
Pump House Blueberry Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pump House Brewery;Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub, and I suspect that freshness was responsible for this ale being among the very best fruit beers I�ve tried. We were told that the small handful of blueberries tossed into the glass were local grown and frozen (because frozen floats and fresh don�t). Real malty body in the blond ale base balanced out the mild blueberry tartness. A true rarity: both MsJaxson and I enjoyed it. A must-have when visiting the brewpub.
Pump House Blueberry Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pump House Brewery;New SKU at the SAQ... Pours a very clear golden with a small white rim that leaves low lacing. Nose is of blueberry muffin mix but you know, with fake blueberries. Taste is not quite sweet but offers some floury cereals and more candy blueberries. Body is light to medium, carbonation moderate and mouthfeel is only very lightly sticky. Overall it has some redeeming qualities but I don�t think I would come back to it. Maybe if it was offered ice cold with frozen blueberries under some blistering sun but even then I�m not sure...
Pump House Blueberry Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pump House Brewery;Can. Pours a clear yellow gold with a white head that dissipates to the edges.

Pump House Winter Warmer;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Other;Pump House Brewery;On tap at the brewery: Deep hazy copper brownish color with low activity. Slightly creamy light brown 2 finger head, lasting around 5 minutes, with okay legs and lace, but with poor swirl activity. Flavors of ginger, nutmeg, dark grains, pears, berries, toffee, herbal spices. Sweet gingerbread feel, moderately bitter. Slick creamy medium body with prickly carbonation, soft crisp. Medium strength finish, dominant ginger, heavily spiced, peppercorn, thick sugary malts like barley and rye, with some leafy hops. The festive type of winter warmer, too sugary I think. A bit of diacetyl, highly acidic. Tastes and feels okay, pretty average. Lacks complexity, tries too much to be accessible. Overall above average quality.

A very apparent clove & ginger aroma with a nice malty backbone. Great mouthfeel, perfect carbonation. Too drinkable for 7%!! The pitcher Dougan and i shared did not last very long! I hope this is available again.
Pump House Winter Warmer;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Other;Pump House Brewery;I can still taste this awesome beer and it had an added bonus of being 7%...
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Clear blonde body, thick white head. The aroma has some spicy ness. The taste is fresh.
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;An all-night ale, if one were so inclined to imbibe in quantity. Had a little trouble pin-pointing the malt and hop origins for Cadian Ale, but know it was a mix of pleasant farm-field cuttings of grasses and crops. Deliciously sweet malt base. Enjoyed on tap at the Moncton, NB, source.
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;On tap at the brewery : Bright pale straw color with low activity. Weak beige 1 finger head, last 2 minutes, poor legs. Flavors of sweet grains, caramel, floral hops. Lots of sugars, low sharpness. Smooth and slick full body with crispy carbonation. Light finish, sweet caramel feel with faint roasted malts, and a little salty. Too similar to the pail ale, and a crappy representation of a cream ale. The body is okay, decent freshness, while the flavors are too faint. Bland and no personality, unlike an Acadian. Overall average quality craft.
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;Bottle from NB Liquor. Pours a clear yellow colour with a thick white head. Aroma is cream soda. Taste is same + cereal, bread. Boring...
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;Clear pale yellow. Aroma of cream sida! Taste is similar. Blueberry. Its just the cream ale with blueberries in it. Like a berliner weisse with syrup?? Not really.
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;I�m surprised so many people are hating on this. I know it�s not spectacular, but give it a break. I�m not a big cream ale fan, but this one actually has a nice body and creamy head to it. It tastes of bread, cereal, nuts and mild floral hopping. It goes down smoothly with just a hint of bitterness. Not outstanding, but you can do far worse.
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;This one seems to be getting a lot of flak but I think he�s an alright fella. The hazy light amber brew really does has a nice creamy texture and is smooth and refreshing. I find it tastes of honey, nuts, caramel and toast balanced by some relaxed floral hops. It�s not mind blowing, just a nice alternative to Macro crap.
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;The first thing I smelt was the smell of the steam after boiling macaroni. The taste had a bit of the same. Very sweet but not much else going on here. Bland and forgetful. Nothing more than a tick in the book
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;Lovely creamy taste and thick mouth feel. The taste doesn't stand out but is quite good. Good carbonation and lattice. Slightly cloudy yellow colour.-- rated via 'Find A Beer' for Blackberry 10
Pump House Cadian Cream Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Cream Ale;Pump House Brewery;Nutty, sweet aroma. Golden with slight green hint of color with a thicker head. Strong on the carbonation with a silky hop taste with a honey palate. Impressive cream ale.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Dark body, big beige head. The aroma has some smoke. The taste is roasted.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;Thanks to Luc for this. Pours jet black with a small beige ring. Aroma is light roasted malt, dark chocolate. Taste is just a good basic stout. Light roasting on the malt, solid bitterness and dark chocolate. A little oatmeal to add body. Solid beer.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;Jet black with a lingering dark tan head. Aroma of chocolate, roasted malt. Very nice beer.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;This stout poured a deep black colour with a very brown head. Not bad lacing. Scents include cocoa and a little coffee. So much cocoa it smells like chocolate milk. First swig was quite good with flavours of smoke, cocoa and coffee. Finish is burnt and smoky flavours linger forever.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;"Nice bitterness, light sweetness, espresso. Medium body, quite oily in consistency. Aroma is really subtle; light cocoa notes. Rich roasted malts, good balance. Really well done overall. Beautiful pitch black pour with a thin tan head, no carbonation stream."
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;Deep dark brown where no light shall pass. Bar-poured head settles a single layer of minute bubbles. The lace starts as a blanket but ends up Dark, burnt caramel aroma. Semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor. Think coffee with half a lump of sugar. Thin body, similar to the Irish versions. This is an easy stout to drink, a good one to be introduced to. It�s flavorful without being overpowering.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;Dark brown color, beige head. Aroma of sweet milk chocolate. Taste is similar.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;On tap at the Pumphouse brewery as I can�t get it back home in PEI. As muddy coloured as the river running through Moncton, she is a beautiful oatmeal stout. You get the nice creamy texture from the oats on your tongue, but also dark roastyness, chocolate, and coffee bite. Finishes off nicely with the oats doing their job. You are welcome to come to PEI, if you want.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;They need to start bottling this and getting it out there. A deep dark umber with a tan-man top. Lots of cocoa, coffee and rich, dark roasted malt on the nose. Taste is mostly burnt toast, dark chocolate, some vanilla latte and molasses. I�d mos def purchase it in bottles if they started doing it, stouts haven�t really taken off on the East Coast here as much as the West.
Pump House Muddy River Stout;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Stout;Pump House Brewery;Pours dark, dark brown with a big tan head. Big roasty malt aroma,chocolate and anise. Thick and oily to drink, great mouthfeel, with that roasty malt, chocolate and anise flavour. Quite a nice stout.
Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I don�t expect the same from a light beer. You can�t compare with those high cal beers, but this has great taste for a light and is priced reasonably. It�s my steady.
Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Clear yellow gold with an ultra-thin creamy white head. Aroma is minimal, but slightly sweet and frowsy. Taste is the same and leaves a mildly sweet aftertaste. Watery, and overall like tainted club soda, but at least it�s cold and wet.
Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"cheers to one of the best boiler maker chasers in New Jersey, N.Y. , P.A. from 1969 - 1979. fleishmanns, four roses you name it this was our fathers "" water"" at the bar. pastuerized so you could trust and rely on it. hey, things were done a certain way in the old days because they worked damn it ! so have some respect. best chaser at .25 cents a glass.

Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Drank straight from a can stolen from my grandfathers garage fridge. Tastes of water with a hint of beer. Its Piels must I say any more.
Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This brings back bad memories as I grew up near PA. This is just cheap light crap and that is it!
Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours straw color with a thin white head. Smells of watery sweet malt and some peppery hints. Tastes sweet and watery with a stray hop or two. Not bad for what it is.
Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This beer is just like all the other really cheap beers, drinkable but only if there is absolutely nothing else around. Pale yellow color, not much taste.
Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pale, watery metallic nastyness. Only used as a last resort. At least Its really cheap.
Piels Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;My uncle used to drink this all the time. He died young. I don�t think I need to add anything else.
Pilot Bay Scottish Wee Heavy;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;Just regular scottish ale, caramel/toffee, some raisin, with a touch of peatyness, light and innofensive, simple, but agreeable.
Pilot Bay Scottish Wee Heavy;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;Toffee and cooking chocolate, subtle underwhelming hop use leaves a thin malty finish. More wee than heavy.
Pilot Bay Scottish Wee Heavy;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;wee heavy my uncle. wee wee heavy i guess. nutty, toffee, some raisins - decent kiwi beer
Pilot Bay Scottish Wee Heavy;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;wee heavy my arse, but it's nice anyway. pretty much like any number of sweet, brown, malty kiwi beers, although cleaner than most of em. good mellow malt/honey aroma. the flavour's sweet, chocolatey and creamy, but pretty simple.
Pilot Bay Scottish Wee Heavy;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;I had this after the Harringtons winter warmer and expected that in view of previous experiences of this brewer that I would not be impressed. Wrong. This beer is a very good one that has a really good presence of slightly peaty malt and hop balance against the surprisingly low ABV. It has a great colour and pleasant mouthfeel.
Pilot Bay Scottish Wee Heavy;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;Nut brown, softly malty, almost buttery, rather sweet, well balanced. Very nice malt profile ale!
Pilot Bay Scottish Wee Heavy;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Pilot Bay Brewing Company;Big malty nose dark amber colour, sweet coffe tate. Nothing to write home about.
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);"Terrible, terrible beer...ive heard the term ""piss-water"" and this is what CD exactly is...Tastes Metallic with an Ammonia finish and i wonder why this beer is ever still on the market. I Would give zero but rate 1 by default"
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);sweet malts, light bitterness, water. all of these nz draughts are starting to get to me. lovely pour though. turns metallic as it warms up.
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);Glad to see that some members of ratebeer do like this beer. I�m of the policy that we should always support the home team, but this is just asking too much. It pains me to see the abandoned building - damaged by our recent earthquakes - with those gorgeous dust-covered copper kettles, waiting for action that could still take years. But there�s nothing special about the beer. Poor aroma, quite nauseating, weak, with beautiful dark copper colour and a reasonable non-offending flavour. Nothing else. It could be worse indeed, but nothing to desire.
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);330 ml bottle at Mt Hutt Lodge. Amber pour, clear and quite carbonated. Not too much head. Yeasty aroma with sweet malty caramel notes. Not too much taste but quite drinkable.
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);Draft. Amber colour, creamy texture, a bit dry. Caramel notes, light sweetness, no bitterness.
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);A great beer, grew up in Christchurch drinking this stuff, and my uncle works at the brewery so always had free samples. Its well finished, mouthfilling, creamy and a strong tasting provincial beer. Sometimes you get it smelling a bit off, but the Canterbury water makes it eminently drinkable. The only bugbera is its hard to find outside of Canterbury and Otago (And you would lynched for drinking it in speights land). Its a secret beer well kept. If anyone visits Christchurch or Canterbury you must drink at least a 6 pack of this stuff.
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);Can. An amber beer with a lazing off-white head. The aroma has notes of caramel and malt as well as light notes of metal. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, caramel, and metal, leading to a bitter finish.
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);330ml can. Faint caramel honey biscuit malt with grassy hops aromas, no bad aromas just very lacking in intensity. Small white frothy rapidly diminishing head, golden light amber hue. Caramel sweetness in the flavour. Medium bodied mouth-feel. Didn�t enjoy the metallic finish
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);Draft at Sullivan�s in Christchurch. Pours a red-copper-amber color with a medium creamy eggshell head. Aroma of sweet malts, caramel, sugar, and light hops. The flavor is very sweet and sugary, and has an unfortunately artificial quality to it. Smooth, but finishes sticky. Easy to drink, but far from anything special.
Canterbury Draught;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Canterbury Brewery (Lion Breweries - NZ);easily the best beer I�ve ever had, but I�ve just begun. Hard to find. My Uncle�s brother stocks up when he�s flying to antarctica and stops in NZ.
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Been sitting in my cellar since 2003. Smoky caramel aroma. Pours dark copper with little head. A little woodsy flavor with some coffee notes. Light carbonation. Sweet malt finish.
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Oxidized nose with a bit of diacetyl. ever so slight smoke and salt nose with a touch of caramel malt. Seems grainy and overattenuated on the palate. Astingent finish.
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);This beer is a Scottish Ale by style, as it is brewed with a variety of malts, included peat smoked whiskey malt. It comes in at a modest 6% abv, but is just packed with rich, robust, malty aromas and flavors. I was really impressed with this beer, from its really distinctive, stubby brown bottle, to the beautiful chestnut color liquid inside. This is an outstanding beer with great character, and makes for a perfect cool weather brew. Malt Mac pours to a beautiful, bright, deep ruby red color with a tight, white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose is fragrant with the aroma of peat smoke, and sweet caramel malt. There is some slight flowery hop aroma, but the malt aroma is the star here. The plate is lean, but with lots of great malt flavor on the tongue. Flavors of sweet malt, dark toast, and hints of sooty, peat smoke flavor glide over the tongue. Malt Mac finishes with more toasty/peat smoky malt flavors up front, then with a slightly dry and sweet malt finish that lingers on the tongue. This beer is awesome. It is just so drinkable, and has such great depth as well. I love the sweet/toasty/peat smoky character of this beer. All I can say is, this is one hell of a good beer, and one I wish I could get a hell of a lot more of.
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle via Milwaukee YeHa! white elephant. Transparent and magnifying deep copper with an oily thumbprint making the most out of the head. Aroma? Frightening. Blue cheese, leather, original flavored bubble gum, pigs feet and burlap sacks. Weak, watery and lucid flavor. Caramel and mildly smoked peat are the most apparent. Stiff stable hay used to stir maple syrup, and use it as feed for the chickens while you�re at it. Streamlined and one dimensional, finishing like burnt bran flakes. Such is the nature of the white elephant.
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle, thanks to Blake for sharing!. Clear brown body with a touch of red. Very nice aroma - light chocolate / medium-roasted malt with sweet peat smoke. Dry peat flavor with a light pale malt backing. Bit of coffee roast in the finish. Nicely smoked flavor but that�s all there is to it!
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Pours to a whitish head atop a dark brown/garnet color. So-so lacing. The aroma is peaty, smoky, oaky, unfortunately, it�s not very strong. I love Scotch, but don�t get the alcohol in the aroma that I love so much with Scotch. The flavor is Scotch-esque. Not enough oak or alcohol in the flavor. I get tons of peat. It ""sorta"" reminds me of Laphroiag 10, but it�s too weak. The palate is mildly Scotchy, but needs more alcohol."
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Dark garnet. Neglectable head. Smoky malt aroma, very peaty. Approachable woody alcohol and minty tones try to add some depth. Light palate, light to medium carbonation. A mild sweetness doesn�t develop much beyond medicinal toasted bread and honey flavors. Slightly roasty in the finish. Interesting to say the least, this, while light, has some of the strongest scotch component I ever encountered, lots of lagavulin like iodine and medicinal strong peatiness. Gracias CaptainCougar!
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Deep clear rich colors of orange and brown. Tall bone colored head that dissipates to half size and leaves a cobweb of lace. Toast caramel and wood alcohol aromas. My first sip I though, ""wow there is a lot of peat in this one"". I then read the commercial description, that explains a lot. Sweet toasty caramel throughout the quaff. Dry earthy finish. Not a lot of depth to this one. Some interesting characters, just not enough of a supporting cast."
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Pours a medium brown color, amber I guess you would call it. Head is minimal, not a lot of lacing happening either. Aroma is faintly herbal. I get just a whiff of rasberry brandy and a slight chemical note. Starts off soft, malty, medium bodied, but builds up to a cresendo on the back of the tounge; big flavors of ripe, dark fruit and malted caramel. Long lingering aftertaste of sweet malt and cherries. A touch of spice; but not in the sense of those overdone American versions of Winter Ale like Harpoon's. This one is very subtle."
Mac's Malt Mac;Auckland, New Zealand;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Nice dark reddish-brown color with a decent head. Has a slightly burnt caramel flavor and aroma. Pretty good, but not great.
Allsvensk;Skruv, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banco Bryggerier (Kopparberg);(Bottle 50 cl) Pretty, fully golden colour with a decent, white head. Some bittering hops and a surprisingly alcoholic character. 061100
Allsvensk;Skruv, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banco Bryggerier (Kopparberg);Orange-yellow with firm white head. Malty aroma with hops and dishwashing tones. Firm bitterness, almost no flavor. Hints of almonds.
Allsvensk;Skruv, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banco Bryggerier (Kopparberg);Hardly any taste at all.....................................................
Allsvensk;Skruv, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banco Bryggerier (Kopparberg);These days most Swedish football clubs in the premier division has their own beer named after them. It seems like Banco didn't manage to get a contract with any of the club, and has therefore named this beer after the premier division itself. Unfortunately this boring pale standard lager does not belong in the premier division, and I relegate it to division IV. Unfortunately also exists in a stronger version.
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at Colter Bay. rather thin & dry for an oatmeal stout. Not so drinkable even for a 5 ounces sample.
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);This just tastes funny. Sort of a watery, kinda minty, something-is-off flavor, kinda like sour milk. I don't know if it's because my palate is wrecked from just drinking a different beer (an inoffensive if not particularly good brown ale), or if I'm using the wrong glassware (teku glasses aren't the best for stouts), or what. Not the glassware, poured it into a dimpled mug and I'm getting the same thing. Maybe there's something wrong with this one, but from what I can tell, this is a bad beer.
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On tap at Gilly�s in Rockville, MD. Just barely clear, very dark mahogany with a nice light tan head and good lacing. Aroma of oatmeal, caramel, light cocoa, light fruit and a little roasted malt. Taste of chocolate malt, oatmeal, caramel, more oatmeal and a number of interesting fruit flavors that roll in and out at the finish. Medium body and medium carbonation.
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pours dark brown with a tan head. Roasted malt aroma with coffee. Flavor is roasted malt and coffee with an underlying sweetness. Roasted finish.

Aroma: fresh-roasted coffee, brown sugar. Flavor: brown sugar, caramel, coffee, chocolate, toast, porridge. Mouthfeel: light- to medium-bodied, slightly creamy finish.
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pours black with a one finger, tan head. Aroma is coffee and roast. Taste is caramel, moving to coffee and roast. Finish is roast. A good oatmeal stout.
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);12 ounce bottle at the house. Smells sweet. Thin beige head, no film on glass. Taste sweet. A little lighter bodied for a stout. Slight taste of malt. Guess I can taste some oats. A little watery. Very drinkable. Decent beer. Cheers!
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Solid oatmeal stout. I had this inadvisably after a long night of drinking other non beer nerd stuff but it was still refreshingly good despite what it likely added to my hangover. Roast and oatmeal with some honey. Fairly dry with sharp dark chocolate. Black pour with good head and lacing. Bitter end. Tap at All Souls Bar in DC.
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Bottle from Franks. Brown coloured. Roasted malts, coffee, oats, light toastiness. Not bad.
Great Lakes Ohio City Oatmeal Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Bottle from Wegmans. Pours hazy brown with min tan head. Roasty dark malt in the flavor, some grain in the flavor, pretty basic and quite frankly average at best.
Lagunitas LAG Lagunator Lager;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Excellent beer but only 6.2% according to the bottle. Doesn�t taste so strong but has the requisite effect.
Lagunitas LAG Lagunator Lager;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Clear straw body. Aroma is dry grain with lemon. Taste is balanced, not too sweet or bitter. Right down the middle. Texture is crisp.
Lagunitas LAG Lagunator Lager;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Pours like iced tea with nice lacing, smells of clean roasted malt, with some hops on the aroma.. very balanced, but a bit malt-heavy.

Lagunitas LAG Lagunator Lager;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);22floz bottle, no date, $4, pint glass. A buttery gumball aroma escapes from this copper lager laden with a beige head. Sometimes Lagunitas surprises me with something that is more than there alright fare. Sure it has earthy hop flavor and bitterness as intended, but there is balance with light sweetness of biscuit maltiness. Tasty, and filling.
Lagunitas LAG Lagunator Lager;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);"Draft to pint. Looks solid; a transparent copperish orange with off-white head. Smells like a malty lager alongside fruity and piney hops. Tastes like it smells with a bit of toast as well. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and toasty. Solid."
Lagunitas LAG Lagunator Lager;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);This bottled brew from a bottle shop was served at a cool temperature and poured a small sized head of foamy fine to large sized tan colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a semi-transparent dark orange brown colored body and a good lacing. The smooth aroma was malty and mild vinous. The mouthfeel was tingly at the start and at the finish malt hop aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of vinous brown malt hops malt and bread dough.
Lagunitas LAG Lagunator Lager;Petaluma, California, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);"Pour from a 22 oz bomber. Beautiful clear tawny brown brew with beige head, great head retention and lacing. Aroma is spicy and resinous - very much IPA style. Taste is sweet malt up front , caramel with woody notes; stays sweet through the finish with some underlying bitterness. the hops in in the nose never shows up in the taste. Interesting brew - reminds me of a malty winter warmer."

Nektar Pivo;Banja Luka, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Banjalu�ka Pivara;Dieses Bier aus der teilautonomen Republika Srpska ist ein klassisches Balkanbier mit hoher Drikability, aber ohne wirklichen Geschmack.

Murky opaque pale yellow color, small to medium sized white head. Smell malts, coriander, a slight touch of sourness. Tastes the same: malts, coriander, some sourness. Low to medium body, low to medium carbonation.
Abbaye d'Aulne Alleluia;Goz�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;Somewhat of a smokey aroma. No head, some malt piercing through. Very nice and smooth flavour.
Abbaye d'Aulne Alleluia;Goz�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;250ml 12-05-99. Brown beer with no head, little carbonation. Served in a Kronenbourg 0.25L stem glass. Poured carefully to avoid the chunky sediment in the bottom of the bottle. Sweet and thick with dark fruits and brandy. Spice and a little bitterness. A little boozy. An interesting beer which is still good though well past its time. What is really amazing is that this beer showed up here in Freakville (Jacksonville Florida) in a local beer/liqour store. I would love to know the story behind this one. Thanks to BeerBlockaid for hooking me up.
Abbaye d'Aulne Alleluia;Goz�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;Lot 12 - 05 - 99 :: Whoa. Gosh damn avalanche of yeast. Looks like the Stari Most lying in the river of Mostar after the Croats blew it up, in the bottom of my glass. Aroma is very seet and spicey with carmel, clove, cinnamon. Taste is the same add some dark fruits. Roast/Coffee after taste. No real big head, but a small one that last. Palate is chewy and soft. I think a few years ago this would have been excellent. I am amazed no ones rated this in so long.
Abbaye d'Aulne Alleluia;Goz�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;(250ml, 1999) Medium beige head atop floatie-filled chestnut brown body -- lots of dead yeast. Aroma is medium sweet, spiced, caramel, cinnamon, brandy. Taste is sweet, spiced (milled-ish), cinnamon, raisin, brandy. medium-full body, lightly carbonated. Past its prime, but still a decent beer.
Abbaye d'Aulne Alleluia;Goz�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;"dark brown, very little head, lots of sediment; sweet malt smell; rich, smooth, thick feel; sweetness and alcohol are the prominent tastes"
Abbaye d'Aulne Alleluia;Goz�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;Dec. '99 vintage. Malty, heavily sweet aroma, some sherry notes, banana/bubblegum esters, apple butter and plummy fruit spiciness, some alcoholic fumes as well. Reddish brown color, very still and no head, with a massive amount of sludgy sediment and particulates. I had noticed this the night before, and let it sit for a day before pouring gently and leaving the last bit in the bottle, and what made it into the glass is still what I would deem excessive. Malty, fruity, vinous and sweet flavors abound, some dark candi sugar, yeast and fiery alcohol are quite apparent. A bit on the cloying side, unfortunately, suffering from a lack of balance and perhaps too long of a rest. This would have likely been better 2 years ago.

Dock Street Royal Bohemian Pilsner (2008-2015);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Dock Street Beer;At brewpub: Pours clear gold with white head. Aroma is grains, grass, and some flowers. Taste is quite crisp. Nice Czech style hoppiness without trying to get it to be all too American. Very fresh tasting, so you get a one up on most of the imports. Good overall.
Dock Street Royal Bohemian Pilsner (2008-2015);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Dock Street Beer;On draft at the brewpub. Pours a clear yellow color with a small foamy white head. Aroma of lemon, yeast, and grain. Taste of lemons, zest, yeast, corn, and grain.
Dock Street Royal Bohemian Pilsner (2008-2015);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Dock Street Beer;On tap at the brewpub. An enjoyable beer to drink with Dock Street�s excellent pizza. Like most American microbreweries� attempts at a Bohemian Pilsner, though, I thought this fell short of my expectations and was not fully true to the style. Bold hop presence but the hops� character strikes me more like a poorly-executed IPA than a Pilsner. Light color, but the beer is too heavy upon drinking. Aroma is fresh, but flavor and sensations on the palate are too heavy. A complete absence of grassy tones, which I always notice in Czech beers. A good beer, but a bit of a let down when I compare to what I expect from this style. I still have yet to have a Pilsner brewed by an American brewery that really strikes me as true to the style.
Dock Street Royal Bohemian Pilsner (2008-2015);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Dock Street Beer;On tap at Dock Street. Clear olive yellow with a white head.

Dock Street Royal Bohemian Pilsner (2008-2015);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Dock Street Beer;Relatively clear golden body. Thin white head, soapy lacing. Nose is gentle with citric and grassy Euro hops. Taste is similar but shows increased grainy presence, more hop spice as well. Light bodied, assertive carbonation, a little thin in parts, but a clean refreshing finish. Good effort, but doesn�t live up to the other pilseners available fresh in Philly, especially Victory�s Prima and Braumeister series pilseners.

Dock Street Royal Bohemian Pilsner (2008-2015);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Dock Street Beer;"Hazy gold, huge citrussy juicy noble hop aroma. Sweet malty taste - as a Czech Pilsener should have - fairly bitter, honeyish malt, big Saaz hops in the finish with a near-perfect malt and bitterness balance. This actually does taste like a quality Czech brew and full marks for the effort; stunningly drinkable and true to style."

Jamesport Dortmunder;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. I liked this one better than the subpar Altbier. Light golden body, thin off-white head. Grassy hops complemented sufficient bready malts. Not too sweet. Light lemony characteristics, but I didn�t pick up any cookie dough (which I love to find in a dortmunder). Quaffable.
Jamesport Dortmunder;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Jamesport Brewing Company;Draft at brew pub. Another very good style version. Medium body with good crisp finish. Very refreshing cookie-like brew.
Jamesport Dortmunder;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Jamesport Brewing Company;A good effort. Instantly siky texture is really nice and the strong hop presence is a nice counterpoint.

Jamesport Altbier;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. I was not a fan of this one at all. Medium brown body, thin buff head. Light, grassy nose with subtle breads and toast. Thin, wispy malt body delivered little malt depth, and finished with a shot of grassy, bitter hops. Poorly balanced. There was really nothing here to grip.
Jamesport English Mild;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;On draft at the pub: Not a bad ale. Not much aroma to speak of, but it tastes fairly good. Easy to drink. Good.

Jamesport English Mild;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;Light brown hue with a golden bottom which has a small off-white head and some lace. The aroma is toasted malt, aromatic hops, apple, apricot, mild spice, and nutty. The taste was very balanced and smooth with a nice hazelnut, ripe fruit and spice undertone. Thin to medium-bodied and a soft mouthfeel. Enjoyable and a brew you can easily drink 3 or 4 in a sitting. Not many mild ales are interesting, this one is.
Jamesport English Mild;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;This is my favorite Jamesport brew - a very pleasant brown ale with just enough spice to its sweet and nutty character to keep me interested.
Jamesport English Mild;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Jamesport Brewing Company;Perhaps the most complex of the Jamesport portfolio. Roasted notes in front, cider at close, interesting alternations of fruit and nut in between. It's interesting but perhaps too busy and suffers from the lack of body that hallmarks the brewpub.

E. J. Phair India Pale Ale;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;[Bottle] Pours amber with a massive beige head that initially makes me wonder if it is contaminated. Not much to the aroma, but some grassiness and biscuity malt is present. Carbonation explodes in the mouth, making it difficult to taste, but there is significant bittering hops and a touch of malt. Very dry finish. Just too much carbo and not enough hops.
E. J. Phair India Pale Ale;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;On tap @ the brewpub. Pours slightly hazy copper with gold edges and thin white head. The aroma has a nice pulse of sweet malts up front with just a hint of spicy to floral hops in the background. Well the taste is much hoppier than the nose. It has full on citrus, spicy and then some floral hop bitterness floating on a stream of malty sweetness. The hop bitterness and flavor aren�t really all that English in style but are more to my liking. The modest backbone of malt sweetness achieves a pleasing balance. Darn tasty stuff but the aroma comes up short.
E. J. Phair India Pale Ale;Pittsburg, California, United States;IPA;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Bottle (Thanks omhper). Nice white head that stays forever. Big fresh hop aroma that makes you just sit and smell it and be happy. Eventually when you thirst is to big the taste is so well balanced with much bitterness that stays long combined with hop freshness and a little caramell. Not to big body makes it drinkable in larger quantities. This is a wery nice beer.

Slightly sweet and faintly sour with caramel, soy, and other things I don�t really know. Taste is balanced. Slightly sweet caramel with unappetizing notes of soy, grain, and floral. Would get this again and probably won�t finish half.

Pump House Firechiefs Red Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pump House Brewery;341 ml bottle from a six-pack from Sobeys Liquor outlet, served in a shaker pint glass. Pours a very pretty caramel brown hue with a tan, fine-frothed head, leaving rings of lace behind. I did not note the carbonation level. Aroma is a complex of vanilla, maple, coffee, roasted nuts, dark fruit, red wine, spices, and even soy sauce. Flavor is redolent with brown sugar, dark fruit, and soft spices, though not all that winey or sweet as the aromas suggest. It feels kind of warming, as of it were mulled. This makes for an ideal winter beer, with its rich, different nose and mouth experiences, and its elements of sweeter, softer ales and chewy, savory stouts. After having my tongue battered by Minhas� two latest atrocities against brewing, this is a lifesaver. Excellent beer.

Mountain Sun Hogback Doppelbock;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Draft at Southern Sun, keg aged 1.5 years: Ruddy brick-red. Thin but creamy light-beige cap of foam. Decent aromas of sherry, metal, toffee-drizzled bread, and dried plums. Soft, minuscule carbonation. Initially sweet yet thickly malty with notes of bread curtailed by a sharp medicinal edge which compounds the sherrylike sweetness. Perceptible raisiny twang offers relief from the sweetness. Oxidation accentuates the decadent deep-rooted chocolate and caramel notes which blossom late. Some graininess lurks beneath the lush malts, but at tolerable levels. Vivid nuttiness cleans up the oxidative remnants. Finishes with velvety whispers of milk chocolate adorned with red licorice and raisins. Surprisingly drinkable, especially considering its age. It�s not overly sweet, and is nice and beefy, maltwise�though not overly refined or characterful.

Mountain Sun Hogback Doppelbock;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Absolutely no head forms atop the dark hazy amber-orange body.

Mountain Sun Claymore Scotch Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Draft at Mountain Sun: Chocolate garnet. Small, buoyant off-tan bubbles comprise a persistent head. Pleasant nose of toffee pudding, nougat, earthy hops, and roast. Mild accents of plum. Soft and compact carbonation. Soft malts yield a profusion of lush chocolate and dry cocoa. Roast produces a hint of chalkiness while the hops and esters fuse together and create a vibrant fruitiness. Smoke-hued roast imparts some chewiness and bolsters the body, as do fluffy notes of nougat. Appropriately subdued fruity esters gorgeously contrast with the relatively high attenuation. Dazzling balance of chalky roast and milk chocolate. Curious but lovely notes of coconut emerge to complement the dense and hefty melt. Finishes cookieish and dryly roasty, yet increasingly hoppy with shades of apricot swirled with a resonant earthy bitterness swirled with beautifully composed plummy esters. Pretty straightforward, but exquisitely malty and oh so quaffable at the same time. Good stuff from a seriously hit-and-miss brewery.
Mountain Sun Claymore Scotch Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Pours a transparent dark amber mahogany with a thin ring of light tan head.

Mountain Sun Claymore Scotch Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Purpleish brown pour, dark and covered by a light brown head. Absolutely unheard of mixture of smoke and fruits is the marking trait of this scotch ale. Donuty sweetness bathes into a sea of cask wood and peaty maltiness. At the same time, intense blueberry, date and plum procure a juicy, drinkability improving feature. Slick medium body of lasting and mellow carbonation, mild. If they had manage to control the frothy tartness, this would be extremely impressive.
Mountain Sun Claymore Scotch Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Deep amber.

Oskar Blues Reverend Sandis Sinful Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout;Oskar Blues Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);"Ewww... holy crap this stuff must be old. It poured out of the bottle like motor oil, and that is in no way an exaggeration... there was a small dimple on the top of the beer (no head) like a thick syrup... I got a spoon and started playing with it, and it reminds me of semi-scrambled eggs, where the white goo is not totally mixed and it's still a bit syrupy and clumpy. I poured the rest of the 22oz bottle into another glass, and this one got all of the yeast at the bottom, so it all came up as floaties to the top and created an awful looking ""hatched"" floaty-head appearance. I should be allowed to rate this a 0 for appearance. Not sure if it's safe to drink even... ok, I'm taking the plunge... can't be worse than CCCB or Triple Bock right? ok... I'll sacrifice my body for the good of man... here goes... aaaaaaaAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH blacccc back into the glass... no carbonation, feels like raw eggs and I'm almost expecting it to start crawling away... dear lord what is this stuff. EASY TO DRINK MY SWEATY ASS"

Oskar Blues Long Jon Porter;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Porter;Oskar Blues Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);I was told that this recipe was slightly altered from previous versions, on tap, 9/20/02: Chocolatey sensation behind a somewhat thin and carbonated body. Had some Belgian brown qualities: some sourness, a lot of strength, and a tingly effervescence. Rather bold beer, but not very heavy. Interesting, but not what I personally like in a porter.

This Scotch Ale pours a deep golden mahogany brown color with a three quarters finger width tan colored head that dissipates rather quickly leaving some lacing on the glass.

Oskar Blues Old Chub;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Oskar Blues Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);35.5 cl can (BBD 2019-07-17), bought from Trevs Bar (DH1 3LN), and drunk at home on 2019-08-15. Appearance is a clear amber-brown with a thick, irregular coffee coloured head that lingers nicely. Maybe a tiny amount of visible carbonation. Nice colour that doesn't appear as often as I'd like in beer. Aroma is good. Lots of dark chocolate, some roasty hints and maybe also some spicy and toffee notes. A good dark beer aroma, although I'd like it a little stronger. Taste is much stronger and equally nice. Loads of milk chocolate and caramel alongside dried fruit hints make it surprisingly sweet up front, with some burnt coffee and roasty malts just bringing a little bitterness towards the finish. Palate is slightly disappointing for me. Medium bodied but on the light side. Thick and velvety with only a little in-mouth carbonation which is good, but the finish is disappointingly short. Overall though, this is still a pretty great beer. I want more on the palate and maybe a slightly stronger aroma, but if I can ever find it again I'll happily pick up a can.

Big Horn Fruit Pale (Blueberry);Lakewood, Washington, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);This seasonal brew from the Ram in Seattle's U-village was suprisingly good. It had a very pleasant blueberry aroma--that was not heavily pungent, but rather redolent of spring. The tast did not dissapoint--though its flavor lost its initial piquance after several sips. This light, but flavorful beer is a unique treat. Rerate: After several tries with this beer, I must admit, it suprises and delights again and again--not much too look at--but nice aroma and blueberry flavor.

Pump House Pail Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pump House Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Clear copper body, small head. The aroma has citrus. The taste is hoppy and malty.
Pump House Pail Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pump House Brewery;On tap at the brewery : Light hazy golden color with faint activity. Slightly creamy white 1 finger head, lasting around 5 minutes, with good legs. Flavors of lemon, sweet grains, caramel, floral spices. Balanced toffee sweetness with zesty citrus. Smooth medium body with crispy carbonation. Light finish, but well intensified, with lingering sharp citrus and flowery hops. Pleasantly flavored, fresh, tender, and filling. Overall very good quality craft. One of their best brew.

Pump House Pail Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pump House Brewery;I tried this on tap on a hot Summer day. Not as refreshing as I would of hoped. I found it extremely sweet, like corn and honey, and a little bit of citrus. There was little to no hoppyness, or bitterness. It drank more like a pop than a beer, with very little lacing or head. I expected a lot more from Pump House as I enjoy most of their offerings, but this was like no pale ale I have ever had, and I won�t be having it again.
Pump House Pail Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pump House Brewery;Copper pour with a thin white lace. Not much aroma. Nice bitter hop flavour with hints of nutmeg and spices. Nice refreshing texture.

Nothing amazing, but plenty drinkable.
Pump House Pail Ale;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pump House Brewery;On tap at the brewpub and several pints at other locations across the province afterwards. Clear gold pour with a thin lacy white head. Grapefruity hop aroma, malty flavor, very light caramel notes, hoppy finish, really balanced. Not as exotic or eccentric as some of the top tier APAs out there, but this is a pretty solid offering.

Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;From a 12oz Bottle, Brewed in 2002, Bottled in 2003. Mostly transparent, coppery tobacco color with shades of rust and an impressively sustaining head of ivory foam, considering the age. Rich, juicy dark fruit aroma that has a welcome oxidized sweet sherry quality. Green raisins and vanilla caramels abound with a touch of honeydew sweetness. Luscious bouquet. Medium bodied, with a soft, yet full carbonation level that�s enough to give it a bit of creaminess. Lots of tart, acidic vinous qualities instantly great the tongue, although it has more of a grapeskin tannic taste than a funky one. A bit of tobacco and broken in leather add some more acidic complexity, but the oxidized fruits from the nose never really arrive on the palate. The oxidation has clearly taken it�s toll, as the flavors tend to fall apart rather quickly in a papery thinness. Finish is quite dry with an almost young American oak-like dryness that lingers in the final smack. A big thanks to Dr. BIll for generously providing this special treat at the PP Real Ale fest.
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;Bottle, in a trade from Notalush, brewed in 2002, bottled in 2003, consumed on 10/6/06 Small beige head loosely clings to the liquid, though it forms quite a pile of froth on the edges. Moderate to poor retention on the head. The body is a dark brown-black with deep purple and magenta tints on the edges. Sediment left in bottle, though it still had only a medium to medium-low clarity. Heavily vinous, oily nose suggests all manners of dark berries. Currants, plums (prunes), concord grapes, elderberries and what have you, with a sweet note of oxidation and light hints of toffee and butterscotch on the finish. Tartness collects on the front of the aroma, with some braised cacao and light licorice notes emerging as it warms. Never does it get very sweet, but just seems, well...old. Mossy/moldy and lightly dirty, it certainly seems like it might be true to the original. Some alcohol esters are perceived upon warming Grapey oxidation and tart berry notes are somewhat softened by light chocolate and caramel suggestions that dry out significantly on the finish. Very low carbonation by now, but the beer is well-attenuated so at to prevent it from getting syrupy/overly thick. Notes of vanilla, acrid roast and tart vinousness are dominant. Very unexpected as an American-made beer, though Phil certainly aims for authentic. I think the grapiness is a bit overt by now, but I do like the tartness, bordering on sourness. And there really wasnt any heavy soy. Malt seems a little too attenuated for an old ale and thus some thinning occurs on the palate, combined with light alcohol dryness. Much more interesting than the new 10th anniversary old ale, however, as the lactic qualities abound but do not dominate.
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;Big Thanks to Clark for sharing this at the blind tasting at Eric�s last month. According to my notes, this wasnt really the best in the lineup. This was an aged bottle- 2002 I think, so there was some light funk and oxidation to the aroma- some funky cheese notes- also hints of sour cherry. Flavor is oxidized, woody, light residual sweetness, with a tart and an astringent finish. My last notes said that I really thought this was a flemish sour ale. Way past its prime apparently, but it was still nice and enjoyable, and something I thought Id never get to try, so it was nice.
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;Poured a dark brown color with a small light tan head. Complex aroma of toffee, brown sugar, and dark fruits. Flavor continues the same elements. Sweet and lightly tart finish.
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;Sampled on tap. Aroma was quite strong consisting of fruits and alcohol. Taste had a nique tartness to it. Interesting beer.
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;"Deep reddish/brown color, moderate beige foam atop, looks good. Nose: airy at first, then tart all over the place, with fruity notes aplenty, green apple, orange rind, twists of lemon. Unusual for an old ale, or maybe they were going in a different direction that I�d have thought...anyway, on to... Taste: Ooooo! Tastness resounds again, brisk, yet bold, and brash, boom!, wince, pucker...ooo, again! (But not a happy ""Oooo!"") Sourness dominates, and there are little other flavors that I enjoy. Medium body, just a hint of alcohol felt, sour finish. This may be appreciated by some, it�s entirely possible, but these flavors just don�t please me at all. Reminds me of some British old ales I�ve tried, like George Gale�s, but i didn�t like those, either. I look forward to being more fond of"
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;Brewed in 2002 - Murky burgundy topped by a rocky tan head. Huge malty aroma, caramel, toffee, and raisins. The flavor is much the same. Fairly straight forwad really. No hops detectable. The body is medium with a surprising amount of carbonation. Thanks to goldtwins for the bottle.
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;Deep plummy brown, little head. Smell berries, pears, alcohol. Smells sweet but dark like toasted caramel. Some raisiny port notes as it warms. Taste: like toffee popcorn at the beach. Unabashedly sweet, mouthcoating, bit overbalanced but the fruitiness somewhat cuts the cloying tendencies. Bit addicting in small sips but not a quaffer. Too much butter flavor.
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;Brewtopia �04: Hazy dark orange, sweet brown sugar nose. Full bodied and lively. Peaty taste in the middle. Fresh tasting and a nice ale.
Southampton Old Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Old Ale;Southampton Publick House;Muddy amber colour. Very malty aroma, with some cherry. Strong alcohol presence interferes with the palate. Rich toffeeish malts abound, but without form nor complexity. Vague fruity notes are pleasant, but for a beer so reliant on the malts, I needed those to be better-extracted. It almost tasted like it was too old.

Big Horn Premium Pilsner;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);On tap at the brewery in Rosemont. With the word Premium, it has to be good right? A good pils in the summer biking heat sounded good, but this was not that. It was however ice cold as their was ice chunks and a hair stuck to the outside of my glass. Yellow hay in color with a white head that fades to a ring. Not much in the aroma. Some grain and pale malts. Grainy malt flavors with a grass astringency and a touch of dough sweetness. Smooth body, but a disappointing and flat out annoying beer. Why did they give me such a big glass?

Crested Butte Red Lady Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Crested Butte Brewing;Bottle purchased in Gunnison. Actually the best beer of the night. But the others were Bud Light Chelada, Gunnison ESB, Steamworks Diablo -- so this wasn�t a particularly stiff competition. Pours light gold, decent head. Mild biscuity aroma, hints of hops whispering around the edges. Soft subtle flavor, again biscuit malts coming forward, a little bit grassy, subtle SNPA-style hops (several times diluted) coming in on the tail end.

Crested Butte Red Lady Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Crested Butte Brewing;12 ounce bottle from BeerandBlues2 Pours red with a bit of carbonation. Pretty much clear. A thin layer of off white foam. The aroma is all malt. Very biscuity. No hops. What up wit dat? Malt is way upfront, but there�s a neutral bitterness. that makes it very drinkable. Medium/light body. Below avarage carbonation. Dry finish. It doesn�t taste bad. I�d say its boring, but it�s a million times better the lots of shitty beers I�ve had.
Crested Butte Red Lady Ale;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Crested Butte Brewing;"(Bottle via trade with BeerandBlues2, thanks Brad!) Really not bad...Pours clear coppery amber with about 1/2"" of biscuit head. Aroma of egg and vanilla maltiness with some light pine as head recedes. Palate surprisingly has some decent heft, is a bit prickly. Pretty soft and smooth. Lacing is fine lacey sheets, kind of nice. Flavor is caramel, egg and vanilla maltiness overlain by light pine. Develops a nice fruity taste also as it warms. Light-medium bitterness which carries through finish and into aftertaste. I enjoyed this and am surprised by the generally lousy reviews so far."

Krolewskie Mocne;�ywiec, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Zywiec (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Smells a bit skunky and quite strong. Not bad, just a bit wrong so to speak.

Krolewskie Mocne;�ywiec, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Zywiec (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Hazy and straw-colored with a lumpy off-white head, this has a sweet malt aroma - the sweetness perhaps having a contribution of corn - with a light, herbal hop bitterness. Nicely carbonated, it has a toasty malt flavor, mildy bittered, and just a bit tinny. The finish features a decent blending of malt and hop with a noticeable alcohol burn in the back of the throat. Mocne! The drink of the gods! Foremost Liquors, Oak Forest, IL
Krolewskie Mocne;�ywiec, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Zywiec (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);"""Extra Beer"" = ""Mocne"" Slightly-hazed golden with a big fluffy head that was slightly yellow, too.

Krolewskie Mocne;�ywiec, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Zywiec (Grupa �ywiec - Heineken);Can�t say that I enjoyed this beer. It tasted similar to the regular Kr�lewskie, but had a weird aroma to it (smelled like menthol almost). Sweet, tasted adjuncty. Had a cardboard flavor in there, and the alcohol was a bit too noticable.

Vostochnaya Bavariya Svetloe Pivo;Kazan, Tatarstan, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod AO Krasniy Vostok (AB InBev-Efes);From the Russian republic of Tatarstan this pale golden standard lager comes. It is sweet, light bodied and clean with low bitternes. Not all that interesting.
Rybinskiy Martovskoe Temnoe;Rybinsk, Yaroslavl oblast, Russia;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Rybinskiy Pivzavod;Nut brown. Rather bitter. Roasty and salty. Perhaps a bit on the thin side.

Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;I was never so happy as the day I stepped into the Empire Brew pub on Main Street Buffalo. Yes it was on a school field trip and yes I returned to the bus with three pints of Purgatory under my belt and my food in a take out container because there wasn�t enough time to eat but hey. The beer didn�t look like much but it had a delicious citrus kick to it with just the right amount of hops. And yes Jer, it definitely is (well was sadly) a breakfast beer. Smooth mouthfeel, not overly distinctive head but a smooth bight from the hops with a great finish. I can�t believe I had the presence of mind back then to make notes about this beer and more so that I found them but hey... that�s the way my brain works sime times!
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;Summer 2002: Had this many times in the brewery and at a 4th of July party for the employees. This was a beer I enjoyed, but not my favorite one from Empire. Hazy golden/copper color. Citrus, & grapefruit notes, with some pine in the nose. Tastes quite bitter and aggressively hoppy, with an oily mouthfeel.
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;grapey aroma with other fruit notes too...cloudy bronze color with a frothy and lacey head..tad grainy flavors with grapeseed touches and some hoppy bitterness thrown in for good times..
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;Sampled at the Rochester location. Clear amber. Small off-white head. Leafy, fresh hop aroma w/ lots of grapefruit. Sticky, medium body. Nice fresh hoppy flavour w/ good malt background.
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;"Matt calls it a breakfast beer; Tastes very much like grapefruit. Cest What offers Al's Cask Ale which is similar, but not as aggressively grapefruity as Purgatory. I was told it was 8% as well. The bitterness was nice, but its not the most refereshing beer in the world."
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;This didnt strike me as an IPA, if that isnt a mistake and Empire thinks this is in fact an IPA. Citrusy to some extent, but has a bit of a stale hops flavor that lingers in the back of the palette. Moderate bitterness, but had that meaty/metallic flavor in the finish, similar to Ithaca Pale ale that i hate. as for the trivia, I guess. . . cascades!
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;Had at the Rochester location. Good colour, a somewhat hoppy smell, but more subtle than most Pales. A good overall beer, but the aftertaste is lacking and only hop flavours really show through. A good one to try if you are at one of the locations, but more of an APA instead of an IPA.
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;"Sampled at the Syracuse location. Light bronze colour; fruity, citric hop nose (cascades); good quality bitterness - not overpowering but gives it a nice bite; after this, however, there is nothing else. Needs complexity and more malt."
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;Orange color. Piney hop aroma. Oily, plenty of organic hops, very big, finishes dry. Nice pale ale.
Empire Purgatory Pale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Empire Brewing Company;Very small head, it does look like tea. Very sweet aroma almost like lemonade with sugar, but! ... Nicely bitter, good decent sample of an IPA.

Krolewskie Porter;Warszawa, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browary Warszawskie Kr�lewskie (Zywiec);Batch 20.7.2008. Incredibly it worked out. Personally, I confirm the fact that beer is unique, it is not just a myth. After eight years of alcohol undetectable. Velvety texture, the flavor is dominated by notes of dark fruit, espresso, dark chocolate. The aroma is mainly walnuts, plums and soy sauce.

Krolewskie Porter;Warszawa, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browary Warszawskie Kr�lewskie (Zywiec);Clearish medium to deep brown-garnet, fairly laced light beige head tops it all. Rich, thick malts make up an obviously sweet aroma directing molasses and lightly anisey and earthy notes to every receptor. The sweetness gains in intensity on the palate, developing more brown sugar character that fades into dark chocolate roastiness toward the finish, cakey and faintly tart. Full bodied, invigorating mouthfeel, with supporting fair carbonation. In almost every facet, this is everything I want a Baltic porter to be, if anything, more fruitiness would make it close to perfection. A mouthful of yummy malt and authenticity. Thank you Jeppe!
Krolewskie Porter;Warszawa, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browary Warszawskie Kr�lewskie (Zywiec);Nutty, chocolatey, powdered cocoa, roasty aroma. Clear dark ruby brown with a low tan head that recedes to partial cover. Cocoa and roasty bitterness are incredibly well balanced with some hints of dried fruit and suggestions of alcoholic strength. Medium body with somewhat low carbonation. Bottle sampled at Barry�s housewarming tasting.
Krolewskie Porter;Warszawa, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browary Warszawskie Kr�lewskie (Zywiec);Pours a clear reddish brown color with a thin light brown head. Excellent aroma and flavor of thick, round, rich malt, molasses and chocolate. The body is light with a refined, vinous texture and medium carbonation. This is as good as a baltic porter gets, polish baltic porters seem to all have a high quality.
Krolewskie Porter;Warszawa, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browary Warszawskie Kr�lewskie (Zywiec);The Lure: Classy berries wrapped in roastiness. Dry vinosity hugging sweet molasses. Elaborate yet sagacious. The Festivities: Fruitiness is marvelously blended into a cream with the roasted malt flavor and bitterness. Some dryness ensues, but caramel maltiness is prolonged into a confident position. A baltic porter of the utmost refinement. Transcendence: A castle on a cliff, piercing the fog.
Krolewskie Porter;Warszawa, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browary Warszawskie Kr�lewskie (Zywiec);500 ml bottle (2004, if I�m reading the tiny print on the back correctly) shared with MartinT, tiggmtl, Rastacouere, beerbuzzmontreal and Yowie. Dark dried bloody color as it pours, fairly thick with just a bit of tan head, lasting...lots of dark chocolate and dried fruits, bit of port and perhaps tobacco in the strong nose...fairly light on the palate, effervescent even, but the chocolaty, flavorful body and raisiny fruitiness works well with the velvety softness...thanks so much whoever brought this!
Krolewskie Porter;Warszawa, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browary Warszawskie Kr�lewskie (Zywiec);Pours a transparent dark brown with a thick, frothy light tan head. Aroma is sweet caramely and malty with some Baltic lager yeast character and a dry roasty, lightly smoked presence. Body is thick, robust and malty with nice hints of dark fruit and good complexity. Also has some milk chocolatey flavor and noble hoppy bitterness. Well balanced, thick, sweet and enjoyable. Many thanks to SpringsLicker for sharing!
Krolewskie Porter;Warszawa, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browary Warszawskie Kr�lewskie (Zywiec);Thanks to Madsberg for this sending this fine brew. Deep ruby highlights in a dark brown body that supports a tan head. This one is different in a good way from the other Baltics I�ve had. Light malt aroma with some chocolate too. The flavor is somewhat complex, some soy sauce, roast malts and caramel sweetness that avoids being cloying in any way. The alcohol is completely hidden. Interesting beer.
Zlaty Hrad;Warsaw, Poland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Van Pur S.A.;getrunken Anfang 2013 Hier versuchte man sich an einem tschechischen Hellem, aber es hatte irgendeinen unangenehmen s��lich-bockigen Beigeschmack, der den ohnehin schw�chelnden K�rper noche einen Faustschlag versetzte.

WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;Sample at MBG U. P. Fall Festival. Dark brown pour with a tan head. Dark roasted malt, semi-sweet chocolate vanilla and coffee in the taste and aroma. Nice.
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;Pour on tap at the brewery, dark brownish black pour with tan head, aroma brought notes of big milk chocolate, coffee, roasted malt into a bit of cocoa, vanilla, sweet brownie with a hint of fruit. Taste was a mix of toffee, vanilla, dark fruit almost into some sweet chocolate, lactose type notes, some roast, finishing sweet.
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;Draft at the brewery. Poured black with little head that went away quickly. Little thin for a porter in my opinion but the taste made up for the lack of body. Lots of vanilla with hints of coffee. Best one I had there.
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;I had this on tap at the WAB. This is the custom porter with vanilla added...The beer pours a dark brown, with a light tan head...The aroma is light sweet chocolate, actually sweet throughout but no vanilla...The taste is the same,very sweet chocolate, is this is a cold hot chocolate? You get a little vanilla on the finish but its very generic, you can tell they totally just added a vanilla extract on the finish into their regular custom porter...The feel is light and hard to drink because of the sweetness. I was told this is there best beer, way, long way to go here.
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;Pouring at the Michigan Brewers Festival during RBSG. Pours a chocolate brown color with a thin beige head. Smells faintly of Reese�s Pieces, chocolate, malt, and cocoa. Just on the thin side of medium bodied, chocolate, toast and a bit of peanut butter. Soft chocolate on the finish, long and sweet.
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;Pours a pitch black with medium white head. Aroma of vanilla, slight coffee, roasted malt, and a bit of dried fruit. Flavor matches, but vanilla is so very dominant in this. Not overly sweet though, making for a very pleasant drink. Happy I decided to get this. And please, if you don�t like vanilla porters/stouts, don�t bother drinking or rating this.
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;"Just love this stuff. Others complain that the vanilla is too prominent, but I think that�s what really makes it special. It is unabashedly a vanilla porter; there are no vanilla �notes,� the entire song is played in key of vanilla. Yum. If only the WAB allowed cigars, I�d truly be in heaven."
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;Chocolate cake. Dark espresso notes. A rich sour bite. It�s not the best thing I�ve had but it�s one of my favorites.
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;"Not a favorite style. I just don�t get the vanilla in your dark beer thing. Btw: that ""commercial description"" doesn�t look very commercial."
WAB Vanilla Porter;Ferndale, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Woodward Avenue Brewers;draft @ brewery. Pours a dark color with a off white head. Nose is chocolate cake, with hints of vanilla and light roast. Taste is pure vanilla extract, overpowering and takes away from a decent nose that offered promise into something delicous. Mouth is syrupy and heavy, finishes with a stickiness in the mouth.
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"From old tasting notes. Labeled as ""Goebel Naturally Light Golden Lager"". Brewed by Stroh Brewing Company. Medium gold. Faint white head. Zesty light malt aroma. Tangy well balanced malt/hop flavor. Effervescent hop finish. Brief sweet aftertaste. Thin bodied."
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Another Detroit standard from my youth. I couldn�t tell this from other micro brews if my life depended on it! Bland taste, light body and slight grain aroma.
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Can. Head goes fast. ""BAD DAWG!"" Next time he pisses in my beer, I�ll shoot the Son of a Bitch! If this is all you could afford, you should have been a decent bum and drank Malt Liquor. It has been either retired or made illegal due to being inhumane. I have had only two beers that were worse and one of them has also been retired. ""Milwaukee�s Beast"" is still around as the #1 worst swill I ever had."
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Man used to drink this back in the day, It was cheap and drinkable, don�t remeber much more think it was brewed by Stroh�s at the time.
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I�m a gobel and have never drank goebel beer, and I can�t find it. I just wanted to know if I am related and if I can get a free 6-pack.
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;awesome cheap beer. loved its flavor, too bad you cant get it anymore. i kept them in business as long as i could especially the college years. everyone i introduced it to loved it. please bring it back.
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Pale gold in color with a thick, resilient, white head. A clean aroma, a light sweetness there an is better than most macros. A not entirely unpleasant flavor. Clean, pleasant sweetness that lacks the corny, overly grainy flavor in most of these beers. A firm, medium/light body, and a dry finish. You could do worse.
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;OK, I used to drink this stuff. When I couldn�t get Blatz or Hamms� or Red, White and Blue. A true classic. The kind of classic like a grade Z horror movie from the 1950�s: you loved it as a kid, but with age comes wisdom. And now, you may think: what the hell, was I thinking. Surely a step above most of the macro-shit out there. If I had some of this I would chug-a-lug some, and quite possibly pay a horrible price on the shitter the following day. Long live Blatz!
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Wow! I have finally had the pleasure to drink Goebel. I am not sure how old the can of beer was. It had to have been a couple of years old. Whatever the case I drank a Goebel. Finally. It has been a long hard road trying to find this beer in Maryland. I had a friend bring it to me from somewhere in the Poconos. After years of anticipation I finally had my chance. After taking two sips I wanted some Pabst Blue Ribbon to wash the taste out of my mouth.
Goebel;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Great memories of this brew.Drinking it with my grandfather when I was about 5 years old.( Old Germans let everyone drink.)Is it still around can it be purchased in Detroit still?

Cantillon Iris;Brussels, Belgium;Lambic - Unblended Jonge / Oude;Cantillon;Bottle from Billie's bottle shop shared, pouring brownish color. Aroma of malts, tartiness, earthy notes, funk, grapes, fruitiness. Quite malty and earthy, with moderate tartness, not highly tart. Slightly on the dry side, tart fruity and earthy aftertaste ending on a funky notes. Excellent lambic, not your usual beer at all, but still nicely constructed thoroughly.

Lav Premium;�elarevo, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Serbia;Why is it that most East European beers comes in 500ml cans?? Anyway, got this from a friend of mine who travelled to Serbia and back. Clear golden colour, forms little head and the head disappears quickly and leaves no lancing, rings or whatsoever. Aroma has wheat and barley, taste has a bit of honey sweetness in it. It did took a lot of imagnation to get that, but I think it had it. This beer, in my opinion, is just below average. Allright for a lager, but I don�t think this beer has ever been lagered.
Lav Premium;�elarevo, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Serbia;Pale golden color,with a medium white head. medium carbonated. Malty finish with a little metallic taste.

Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;Puszka na wyprawie rowerowej w 2006r. Piwo o specyficznym aromacie i smaku wody wapiennej, mnie nie podchodzi.
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;Sehr milder Getreideantrunk, hell. Trotz der Milde ist hier betonenswert, dass das Bier nicht w�ssrig ist. Ganz leicht herb, erfrischend. Es geht mit wenig �nderungen weiter, die helle Getreidigkeit ist weiter f�hrend, auch wenn ein milder aber durchaus ausdrucksvoller Hopfenton auftaucht. Im Abgang dann doch noch w�ssrig, sp�t etwas hopfig herb. Mildes aber gelungenes Helles.
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;Can be hard to find locally in Belgrade, but was the standard at my local. Spicier malt blend, sharper hops maybe but more cutting overall to local lagers. Funky sharp nose and sip were interesting starts to a spineless lager body. Not bad, some intentions here perhaps.
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;Bottle. Pale golden with small white head. Light grain and weak hop notes. Flavour is the same. Mild bitterness. Fizzy finish. Nothing exciting.
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;2L PET and can. Pale yellow color. Grainy aroma. Grainy flavor, maybe over-pasteurized. Nothing for interest.
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;Bottle shared by KnutAlbert. Coarse white head, mostly diminishing. Body is brilliant pale yellow. Sugary grains and nothing else in the aroma. Taste is rubbery and unfresh sweet. Notes of stale bittering hops. Watery. Sharp metallic finnish. Poor stuff.
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;Small white head. Paleish yellow body. Watery sugary perfumy grain aroma with corn notes. Sweetish-dry rubbery floral watery taste. Smoothish watery mouthfeel. No afteraste. Well... (0.5l bottle from Knut Albert.)
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;Bottle. Some flowery hops. Sweet malt, some perfume, thin and watery. A very boring beer.
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;330 ml bottle. Very pale golden. Tall white fine-laced head that clings to the glass. Papery and with a sweet sugary aroma. Smooth texture. Fairly low carbonation. A little unbalanced and artificial. Little, if any, bitterness.
Weifert (-2010);Zaje�ar, Serbia;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Heineken Srbija - Zajecar;0.5 l can from a store in Herceg Novi, Montenegro. It had pale yellow body with medium sized, ugly industrial frothy head that went down slowly. Smells artificial as well, it�s malty reminding flowers with notes of fake honey. Flavor isn�t nice, too...an initial touch of cardboard turns into some better flavors like sweet malt. Some undefined sourness, besides just a bit lemony hops here, as well as in the finish. Medium bodied and very simple brew. Notes of metallicity in its finish. Didn�t like it, it was just a boring pale lager, however, it was strange to see how it was getting better with every sip.
Gotlands Wisby Kloster�l;Visby, Sweden;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Gotlands Bryggeri (Spendrups);"28-04-2019; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The looks of the beer are nice. The beer has a nice golden yellow colour. It has a slight haziness. On top of the beer a nice layer of soft white foam is formed. Foam retention is quite low. A nice drape is left on top of the beer. The aroma of the beer is fine. Malts are grainy and simple. The hops are herbal and strong. They come with a slight fruitiness too. Also a floral note. The yeast gives some spicy notes too. But, all in all, not super special. The taste of the beer is alright. The tastes are not completely balanced. The hops bring quite a strong bitterness. The malts do bring sweetness, but they could have been a bit stronger to fully outbalance the bitterness. Now this is a bit too strong in comparison. The palate of the beer is fine. Light body, a bit thin texture and medium carbonation. The finish of the beer has some of the fruity hop aromas and a malty sweetness. This fades to leave quite a strong hop bitterness that ends rather dry. All in all, a fine beer, but not the best one around. Still well above average though."

Nottingham Road Pickled Pig Porter;KwaZulu-Natal: Nottingham Road, South Africa;Porter;Nottingham Road Brewing Company;Great colour deep red black/brown. Attractive aroma roasty, nutty?

Nottingham Road Pickled Pig Porter;KwaZulu-Natal: Nottingham Road, South Africa;Porter;Nottingham Road Brewing Company;Pours a deep brown with off-white head. Overall a nice presentation. Aroma of metal and some roasted malt. Citric and puke-like mouth feel with medium carbonation. Aftertaste is lasting sourness with lingering metal finish. Overall: With loads of metal in aroma and afteraste, and the weird sourness/puke i got in the mouth feel, it is obvious that this is poorly made. Last off, i love craft beer cans! so one point extra for that.
Nottingham Road Pickled Pig Porter;KwaZulu-Natal: Nottingham Road, South Africa;Porter;Nottingham Road Brewing Company;Can poured on 3/3/14. Pours black with a loose and quickly dissipating off white head. Aroma is of metal and maybe some faint roasted malt but that might be wishful thinking. Taste is sour metal upfront... and sour metal to finish. No complexity and all bad. Not a good beer. Hard to drink.
Nottingham Road Pickled Pig Porter;KwaZulu-Natal: Nottingham Road, South Africa;Porter;Nottingham Road Brewing Company;Overwhelming alcohol flavours. Nice aroma, but hotness killed the taste. Tragedy of grain and mash selection. Might improve with brewer education

Nottingham Road Pye Eyed Possum Pilsener;KwaZulu-Natal: Nottingham Road, South Africa;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nottingham Road Brewing Company;From plastic bottle at argo0�s xmas party, thanks argo0! It is my opinion that this beer was very past its prime, if it had a prime to begin with. Kind of peach colored, little carbonations, lots of things floating around. Aroma is kind of fetid, sour, medicinal, syrup. Flavor is watery crap--sour, some kind of fruitish sourness, and just flat out bad. I don�t think the tape across the top of the bottle helped to keep this beer fresh as it traveled from South Africa to DC. Maybe all of the beer in the bottle was confiscated at customs and replaced with, well I�m not really sure.
Nottingham Road Pye Eyed Possum Pilsener;KwaZulu-Natal: Nottingham Road, South Africa;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nottingham Road Brewing Company;1L Plastic bottle, thanks argo0. Sort of foul aroma, like it�s possibly infected with a hint of odd fruitiness - nothing fresh or herbal smelling. Cloudy, particle-y dirty golden with no head. Somewhat sour-ish, woody, light wood, plenty of bitterness though. Not fresh, herbal, or grassy.. Watery texture with light carbonation. Doesn�t resemble a pils at all.
Nottingham Road Pye Eyed Possum Pilsener;KwaZulu-Natal: Nottingham Road, South Africa;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nottingham Road Brewing Company;(1L plastic bottle) Minimal white head atop lightly hazed light orange/pink. Aroma is medium sweet, starfruit, cantalope, orange. Taste is medium sweet, grassy, melon, some lemon sourness. Low carbonation, light body. Pilsener?
Nottingham Road Pye Eyed Possum Pilsener;KwaZulu-Natal: Nottingham Road, South Africa;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nottingham Road Brewing Company;"1L plastic bottle, courtesy of argo0. Thanks, Aaron! Sort of. Looks like dandruff mixed with watered-down peach juice. Some peachy / apricot notes and water in the aroma; a bit sweet. Slightly chalky and odd peachiness in a light mouthfeel: kind of gross and watery; not much here. Light, sugary and dry fruit character in the finish."

Wow this was a great surprise! Pours clear gold with stable white head. Aroma combines doughy malt with very interesting floral hops. The palate is soft and silky. Is very Fugglsy, evocative of English beer, with earthy mushrooms, wet flowers, raw and toasted sunflower seeds. Even as it warms, or maybe because it warms, the flavors come out nice especially the lovely, intriguing hop character. Highly sessionable. Haven�t tasted anything quite like this...a beer highlight of the trans-Sib.
Buket Chuvashii Vizitnoe;Cheboksary, Republic of Chuvashia, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buket Chuvashii;Very light gold colour. Peachy, chutney-like aroma. Wet, with a faint malt note. Slighlty heavy body for the style. Sweetish, slightly fruity finish.

Pennaya Kollektsiya Pennaya Prokhlada;Cheboksary, Republic of Chuvashia, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buket Chuvashii;Bottled at 4.6% ABV. Seemed to be a twin of Pennoe Serebro. The only difference is a slightly lower alcohol content.
Pennaya Kollektsiya Pennaya Prokhlada;Cheboksary, Republic of Chuvashia, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Buket Chuvashii;Bottle. Pale golden color, small head. Herbal aroma, but taste is not so powerful - not simply lager, but not so hoppy. Not bad.

Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle from old backlog notes early/mid 07 though I don�t know how old the bottle is.

Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle: Cola-brown with a short, oatmeal head. Slightly metallic, nutty aroma. Taste is watery, coffee grounds, bark, earthy hops. Ok, but extremely watered-down.
Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;5oz sample pour at Oasis. Filtered ruby amber-brown. Thin, oily head. Not unlike a British Mild, but with a soapier, more bitter hop balance. Caramel, nutty, light chocolate, lots of depth. Clean, well brewed offering. A great session beer.
Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Poured into a perfect pint. 3.5 A: Not really brown in color. It�s more of a clear copper amber. Two fingers of frothy beige head. Retention is about average and a short ring of lacing is left. 3.0 S: Dry toastiness, a bit grainy, cocoa powder, and a touch of caramel. Something along the lines of mineral, but not exactly mineral - something more earthy. Light floral hoppiness. I know this is a session ale, but it�s not putting forth enough quality aroma to do it for me. I�d had enough session beers to know that you can still get a complex, powerful nose from them and this fails at that. 2.75 T: Like the nose, this lacks depth of flavor and complexity. Earthy mineral quality is back again. Light toast, grain, caramel, and quite dry. 2.75 M: Light body. Good moderate carbonation. It does have a nice creaminess to it, but it�s like creamy water instead of creamy beer. This doesn�t need to have a higher ABV, but it does need more malt. 2.5 D: It�s goes down easy, but I really wish I didn�t have another half of a bomber of this. I can�t wait till this is over and I can pour something more flavorful. Serving type: bottle 02-09-2013 00:56:50
Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Sampled at an esbls tasting. Dark brown semi clear. Light spices in the aroma. Flavor is a little thin. Some spices and fruit. Not a great beerbut I love the low ABV.
Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;On tap at Firkin. Poured light-medium garnety-brown with a short-lived beige head. The aroma picked up sweet honey, lesser bready malts and a touch of toffee at the core, with light herbal hop accents. The flavor found soft nutty notes and toffee at the core, with herbal hoppage and a touch of cocoa around.. quick, fairly sweet finish. Light-bodied and smooth on the palate.. lower carbonation.. overall very drinkable.
Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle. Pours red brown with a little soapy khaki head that leaves a sudsy collar. Aroma has subtle, but noticeable roasted malt and little tootsie roll scents. Taste is just as before. Palate is thin with a drying finish. Light easy drinking beer.
Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Garnet brown pour with a 1 finger, beige head. Aroma is full of nutty, toasty and cereal notes, a little caramel, faint toffee and corn and just a touch of herbal hops. Flavor is light, but not lacking in malt depth, lots of toast, a little roast, roasted nuts, some toffee (not overly buttery), bready yeast, light mineral notes and some earthy and herbal hops finish it out. Light bodied (though not nearly as light as I expected at 3.4%abv), creamy to oily on entry, light, but sharp carbonation and off dry, still slightly oily finish. Pretty damn nice session beer other than the bomber packaging. Sell it in packs for a reasonable price and it�s a winner.
Two Brothers Brown Fox Session Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mild Ale;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Poured from bomber from store. Pours a khaki or almost white head that mostly dissipates. Taste of rich malts, with a small hint of smokiness like roasted coffee, sweetness of toffee. Hops barely present, just to provide some balance but leave with an overall malty brew. What a great beer for a session. Surprised the ratings were as low as they were. A great beer to go along with weekend chores. Great full flavor but doesn�t make you stupid drunk.

Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);I thought I would never have the taste of balls in my mouth, then I tried this beer. First time for everything I guess.
Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Corny. Slimy. Undercarbonated. One of the worst of the buck-a-beers. Avoid if at all possible.
Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);12 oz bottle. Golden colour, thin white head. Aroma of pale malt. Lightly herbal. Poor flavour with plenty of graininess. Bland to poor.
Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Pale gold with thin white head. Grainy aroma with a hint of hops. Moderately sweet flavor. Unmemorable.
Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Similar to their steeler, only this one I had in a bottle. A little more flavour, though smiliar in all aspects pretty much. Perhaps alittle more hops........ Maybe they decided to add 2 hop pellets to the batch.
Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Pale gold, with more aroma and flavor than the lakeport pils. Some honey and citrusy hops in the aroma and taste. Don�t get me wrong, this is still swill, but it�s swill with a bit of an attitude.
Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);It�s a macro-clone. Mild, sweet aroma, thin white head on pale body, lightly sweet, mildly bitter, kind of watery with high carbonation. Drinkable but unexciting and it will leave you gassy.
Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Not half bad for the price, 9.99 for 24 cans isn't bad. I'll stay away though.
Lakeport Premium Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);It's what you would expect from a beer this cheap. I actually found it to have a hint of cinammon taste, but who knows.

Truly Canadian Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);I met up with this in Michigan... Do I truly remember or was I truly drunk.... Neith matter. Me I�m Truly Canadian and Truly unsatisfied. Did you know I used to live down the road from Lakeport.... If the Americans saw where the water came from... they might be truly horrified. Hmmmm. And if you thought Sir John A. Macdonald was ugly try having him in your wallet everyday. Actualy right now tht would be nice I could use some ca$h.
Truly Canadian Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);In NJ we must get weird different labels for the Lakeport beers because neither the malt liquor or the truly canadian that I got from their brewery match up with what everyone else says. Besides that, Truly Canadian is Truly Not Good.
Truly Canadian Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);As unoffensive as a Canadian. I picked it while plowing through the local beer pub's low-cost choices, and if not for the ugly politician on the can I wouldn't have remembered TC at all.
Truly Canadian Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);"According to the website - ""Sir John A. Macdonald was Canada�s first Prime Minister who had a passion for �truly Canadian� fine beer. His picture graces this can so I got a history lesson along with a bland beer. Aroma and inital flavor had a bit of honey sweetness to it. It was all downhill after that though. Settled into a typical cheap lager taste with the acompanying aftertaste and light golden almost see though appearance. Not so bad I could not finish it mind you!"
Truly Canadian Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);It's a lager. Cold and wet and didn't make me gag...........................
Truly Canadian Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Hahahaha. You guys have to see this can. It's moss green, with a Wall Street Journal-style etching of some Canadian PM. Who knew that Pat Paulsen was a Canuck founding father?! Other than that, it's basically Busch.
Truly Canadian Lager;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Lighter than their Lakeport Lager, the can, paradoxically, suggests a better beer, with its green coloring and engraving-style picture of some sort of founding father of Canada (I forget who at the moment.)

O'Hanlon's Red Ale;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Red Ale - Irish;Hanlon's Brewery;A realy good Irish red ale. It?s deep burnished copper colour is a delight to the eye. It has a mix of toffe and fruit aroma resulting in a smooth mouthfeel
O'Hanlon's Red Ale;Newton St Cyres, Devon, England;Red Ale - Irish;Hanlon's Brewery;"Cask at JDW Charlie Hall; dark copper pour with off white head, fruity aroma, biscuit malt flavour, toffee some bitterness."

Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Nice amber/red color with a very strong malty aroma. The flavor is that of amber malts with just enough hops to create a balanced flavor. Nothing really that notable about this brew, good or bad. Just a blah brew that could use just a little something to make it notable.
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Bottle from Vons. Light brownish pour. Kind of like watered down Coke. The aroma is of burnt corn flakes. Sweet and somewhat sour corny flavors. Very caramelized flavors. Tastes like food coloring and seltzer water.
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Bought in a mixed 6 pack from Vons: I was easily fooled into thinking this brwery was a microbrewery out of Eureka California because of the label and design of a gold digger. But, its a macro company out of the snowy cold place where gold does not exsist. Very bland and coming up empty. Loser of the bunch.
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Everything about this beer is weak. One of the other reviewers put it best when they called it diet amber. Very poor head. Drinkable, although barely.
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Smells and tastes like diet amber. This beer has almost no pizazz and no character. Faint malt is hidden by tangy water. Why am I drinking this? Oh yeah, �cause I bought it. Avoid this brewer.
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;weak head with a weak ,kinda skunky, aroma. flavor was average with kinda malty hints, and just a hint of hops. very average
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;are we certain that this is an amber ale because I really really want to put this in the same ctageory as something like killians. This was as far as I am concerned a hoppier version of Killians with a way more crappy pale lager mouthfeel. Sucked g-rat
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Just an average beer. Too much of a malty flavor for my tastes. I wouldn't recommend this beer.
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;How does this get such a high rating, maybe everyone was high when they had this. A hint of malt is pushed to the background by loads of rice and metal. Smelled much like one part beer, 8 parts water, and tasted pretty much the same. Keep up the good work gluek, you are not straying from your high standards of sucking.
Eureka Red;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Appearance was lacking, no head. Malt aroma. Pretty much just malt taste, palate is a little weak. Not a bad beer but could use a touch more of hops.

Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Ohmygosh, is hell here? This crap is putrid, and when I say putrid, I mean, Oh,-Please Let-Me-Have-My-Nails- Ripped-From-My-Fingers-Sans- Anasthesia! bad ... Quite possibly the epitome of fermented poo... Some weird pseudo-spices jab at your tongue incessantly, and I�m not sure why. The malt tastes rancid, and the hops HAVE to be last year�s reject batch.
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Huge, lacing, clinging creamy off-white head on a slightly hazy amber/orange body. Mild aroma with a fruity, citrusy metallic tinge. The flavor is mostly metallic with a bit of pepper and a hint of bread, most is mostly dominating through the finish with a lingering bitterness that doesn�t suit the supposed style. There is more substance here than a Bud, for sure, but it probably achieves a worse result because of its offensive elements.
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Light colored beer, with numerous funky flavors. Basically if someone grabbed all the gravel from my driveway, buried it in the backyard for two weeks, dug it up, threw it in my old sneakers, dropped it all into a barrel to age, and then bottled is what it tastes like.
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Kawa delivers a strange beer! Plain orange color, nose is hinting at fruity hops and grainy adjuntcy body. Basically little flavor at all. Some fruity citrus at the finish. Cool label, though!
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Orange pour with no head. Doesn�t smell as bad as I would expect from a beer in the 3rd percentile. Flavor is the slightest bit off. Not a good english pale, but not as aweful as it has been rated so far. Thanks to Kawa for this beer.
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;"Poured pretty light amber with rich tan head...smelled pretty good...hops fading into a sweet malty nutty scent...I now want to say that I think everyone has rated this beer too harshly...yummy and flavorful it was not, but it certainly didn�t suck (given the consistency issues this brewery has I might�ve gotten a rare ""good"" bottle)...tasted immediately sweet and a little sour...sort of bready...mild hops cleaned up the sourness quite well...finish was a bit grassy though...definately thin and watery though..."
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. pours a light tan with a thick off white head. light fruit aroma. taste is tornado like, starts with a decent hop taste, but twists into a bad budweiser impersonation. sends the taste buds looking for shelter from the crap storm it has unleashed. i don�t know how they did it but this is the worst aftertaste i�ve had in a while. leaves a sweaty leather taste(don�t ask how i know what it tastes like, just accept it) lookout drain here it comes.
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Hahaha! Is this supposed to be a pale ale? It's more like cardboard with maybe a little bit of malt.
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottled. This beer was pretty terrible - I have a hard time believing it was a pale ale - tasted more like BMC crap to me.
Great Grains Texas Tornado;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Dark amber with a thick but quikly dissipating light beige head. Slightly sour and fruity aroma. Insanely carbonated body that was literally hard to swallow on the first drink. The flavor is really unimpressive, with a weird mix of grain, cardboard and fruit. The finish is lightly yeasty. I didn't like this one.

De 3 Horne Kandeleir Winterbier;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De 3 Horne;There really should be an optional category for sound, because this one sounds great.

Sibirskaya Korona Originalnoe;Omsk, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Omsk (AB InBev-Efes);"Interestingly, Belgium's Interbrew won a trademark dispute over Mexico's Grupo Modelo over the name Corona in Russia. This brew has a strong lager aroma. Small head; mostly disappating. Light carbonation and no lace. Deep gold in color. Flavor is there (not bland or dull) but it is still a fairly average lager."

Tolstyak Svetloe (Lyogkoe);Saransk, Republic of Mordovia, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod Saransk (AB InBev-Efes);PET 2L. Clear yellow-golden, white head. Soft pale malts, some macro harshness. No hops whatsoever. The mouthfeel is soft, despite some CO2 and slight astringency in the after taste. Could be drank, but better be avoided.

Pours deep yellow and crystal clear, with large bubbles and a soft white head which does not stay. A plain aroma of corn and grains with grassy notes. Bland taste - nothing special, some malt and faint hops. Carbonated as all lagers, and pretty easy to drink if you can disregard the lack of taste. Not impressed.
Tolstyak Svetloe (Lyogkoe);Saransk, Republic of Mordovia, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod Saransk (AB InBev-Efes);This beer was not so good. No foam at all. I bought 2 bottles of 1 liter. So I have one to go. I gave it a second chance. And supprice it was much better.

Soralam� Slurp!;Vaie (TO), Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Soralam�;Bright hop nose, lemon, grapefruit, light white grapes, spices and minerals. A bit of honey-biscuit malt too. Hazy, almost pastel, pale golden with a tall, fine, airy head. Flavor is pithy, citrus hops, honey malts, grains, minerals. A bit too grainy. Hops are very new world, slightly pissy and very minerally. Doesn�t quite keep up with the nose, especially maltwise. Crisp body, though, and a bright, bitter finish, maybe just a bit too bitter. Verging on a bit of DMS.
Soralam� Slurp!;Vaie (TO), Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Soralam�;Niente male la pils di soralama, bel colore oro carico velata, ampia schiuma bianca frizzantina, buona carbonazione, al naso erbacea e floreale, con buon amaro durante la bevuta.

California Sequoia Redwood Red Ale;Alhambra, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;California Brewing Company;Cinnamon-red appearance. A light Newcastle Brown in an amber body. Little taste and character. Others chimed in with 'bad taste' and 'no character'. Will try this one again to be sure. This one certainly fails to hold its own against their wonderful IPA.
Two Brothers The Bitter End Pale Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Taster at Warrenville brewpub. Considering the name I was expecting this to be, well, bitter. I was also not expecting to like it as I generally hate APA�s. However, this beer has a honey-breadiness and very restrained hopping that I find very delightful. Nice beer.

Two Brothers The Bitter End Pale Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Tasted from bottle. Pours a clear amber with white head.

Oblomov Svetloe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Heineken (Heineken);mmmm...lobster beer. I'm not really sure why there's a lobster on the label, as I was unaware that they had such things in Russia. Sturgeons, yes, I knew about those, but lobsters? Clean, malt-accented lager with a light yeast note.
Karksi Eripruul;Karksi, Viljandimaa, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Karme AS (A. Le Coq);50cl bottle. Just a simple pale lager. Feels like typical A Le Coq premium at its best. Good with grilled pork.

P�rnu Magus Mary;P�rnu, Estonia;Flavored - Fruit;AS Puls Brewery;330ml bottle (Tallinn). Dark red color. Sweet, jammy, cherries in aroma. Cherries, sweet, honey in taste. Way too sweet for me.
P�rnu Magus Mary;P�rnu, Estonia;Flavored - Fruit;AS Puls Brewery;I don''t like it, but my wife did. I think, beer with cherries is interesting idea, but not very bright.
P�rnu Magus Mary;P�rnu, Estonia;Flavored - Fruit;AS Puls Brewery;"Yellow-brown. Fairly dry with nice flavour of ripe cherries. Unusually good fruit lager. Please send me that Quidi Vidi, Oakes ;-)"
P�rnu Magus Mary;P�rnu, Estonia;Flavored - Fruit;AS Puls Brewery;Very candyish and cloying cherry lager. Eerily reminiscent of the ghastly Quidi Vidi Kriek from Newfoundland.
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"Drank this straight from the can. I didn�t know if this was a ""true"" malt liquor or not, but indeed it is. Given that information this might just be second runner to Mickey�s in terms of smooth and regular tasting malt liquors. Also, this is a higher percentage so that gives this beer more credibility that it is drinkable. Nice blond coloring with light carbonation. Smell is hay, sweet, some metal and tiny bit alcohol. Taste is good, has a nice mouthfeel and feels like a true beer going down. Highly satisfying, I drank this on a warm pleasant day in my back yard and I felt like it was the perfect beer for it. I like this beer, I might like this more than Mickey�s actually...."
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance- The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a billowy white head of two finger height. The head has a light level of retention, fading rather fast to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell � The aroma of the beer is strongest of a corn and sweet caramel smell. Along with these smells comes some notes of a paper smell as well as a little bit of a more grainy aroma. Taste � The taste begins with a sweeter corn syrup taste mixed with a little bit of a bready flavor. As the taste advances some more metallic and paper flavors join the taste profile, giving a somewhat off flavor to the brew. A grainy flavor replaces the bready at the end of the taste, with the flavor that is left on the tongue at the end being one that is of a malt liquor base, with it being somewhat musty and metallic, all while not super offensive,. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner and more watery side for an ale of 7.2 % with a carbonation level that is on the slightly higher side. While it has a lighter body, the thinner feel mixed with the higher carbonation level is more appropriate for the sweeter, more malt liquor like flavors of the brew, and make for a rather easy drinking feel. Overall � Not the greatest malt out there. It has a bit too much of an off metallic and papery taste to make it one of the better for the style.
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Sampled during RBSG. From notes. Corn, grains and oddly grainy. Surprisingly good.
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;16 Oz can poured incorrectly. Figured what the hell. Barely local, but still. need the tick. Horrible aroma to this. Ouch. Suprised I can drink this stuff with this blast of pure nasty. Flavor is much better, though that doesn�t necessarily make it good. Flavor is mostly absent, which I don�t know if I should be thankful for. Crisp finish. People drink this for pleasure? This was strictly business. To end on a good note, there absolutely has to be something worse out there. Maybe I�m being a little harsh. Tastes like a less than appealing pilsner. Alllllright.
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;"a ""little"" better than the standard Rainer (which is utter garbage so really not a compliment). Just less offensive swill with better body and ever so slightly cleaner."
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Can @ RBSG Grand Tasting. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Has a fruity malty grainy aroma. Sweetish malty grainy flavor. Has a sweetish malty grainy finish.
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Can during RBSG 2014 Grand Tasting at Schlafly Tap Room. Yellow with off-white head. Aromas of skunk. Tastes of skunk and wheat. Light body with a dry finish.
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;Can @ Presidential Suite. Clear golden pour with a small white head. Ginger ale, 7 Up, and corn. Very sweet, sugary, and cidery. Flavor is just all sugary sweetness. Corn, apple juice, and 7 Up. Really weird chemical bitterness. Not tame.
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;16 oz. can opened at the RBSG bottle �n fart �n malt liquor share. Pours a pale gold, clear, with a small white head. Notes of pale malts, corn, straw, minerals, candy, maybe some apple. Light-bodied, with medium carbonation and a sweet mouthfeel. The Koolie 600 right before it worked a bit better.
Rainier Ale;Los Angeles, California, United States;Malt Liquor;Pabst Brewing Company;I have wanted to try this beer for a very long time and now that I have I am disappointed it is neither as good nor as bad as I hoped. It is clear and strong and just petering on the edge of where malt liquors taste like stronger versions of regular cheap beer and start getting into strange Jolly Rancher off notes. Definitely a good choice if you are of the mindset to get good and hammered.

Weidmans Naked Nut Brown Ale;Fort Smith, Arkansas, United States;Brown Ale;Weidmans Old Fort Brew Pub, Inc.;This is all that is left of might weidemann. it's a sad attempt at microbrew apperance of what was once a mighty macro. this is nothing like the original, the quintessencial 'fishing beer' but now all of that is lost. Sorry guys, you blew it. I'd give a 2.7 to the original if I could ever drink it again.
Weidmans Naked Nut Brown Ale;Fort Smith, Arkansas, United States;Brown Ale;Weidmans Old Fort Brew Pub, Inc.;This is as bad as a nut brown can get. Nuts?? All I taste is spoiled fruit and skunk. This is one horrid attempt. No wonder this brewery has no other ratings and is now probably defunct.

P�rnu Tulip�hvel;P�rnu, Estonia;Malt Liquor;AS Puls Brewery;500ml bottle (Hulja). Clear dark golden color. Strong alcohol and acetone in aroma. Malty, salty, cardboard in taste. Medium carbonation. Nope.
P�rnu Tulip�hvel;P�rnu, Estonia;Malt Liquor;AS Puls Brewery;(Bottled) Golden color with small head. Quite nice, sweet and strong toffee-liquour aroma. Very sweet flavor with toffee, syrup and malt. Medium-bodied, sugary, warming and slightly burning, alcoholic palate with medium carbonation. Very nice surprise as a malt liquour, and very, very drinkable - not in large quantities, though. Finally some good stuff from P�rnu!
P�rnu Tulip�hvel;P�rnu, Estonia;Malt Liquor;AS Puls Brewery;Golden color with no head. Sweet malty aroma. Pretty thin body and bland flavor, sweetness is present in start and in ending.

Ruddles Wheat (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greene King;Bottled: Golden. Clear. Small, lasting head. Creamy. Bread combined with some sweet notes in the aroma. Lemon too. Mild flavour with vague traces of wheat. It has an odd sweet note too which resembles fresh apple juice. Not a wheat bear judged by german og belgian standards. Quite drinkable nonetheless. Draught: A very comfortable palate, smooth. Better.
Ruddles Wheat (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greene King;(Bottle 50 cl) Deep golden - bordering amber - with a small, creamy and dense head. Very soft and slightly sweet with a low carbonation. Marked, smooth wheaty touch, but nowhere similar to neither German nor Belgian wheats. Reminds me more of a pleasant, caramelish English strong ale. Very quaffable. 161101
Ruddles Wheat (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greene King;From The Bottle,pale yellow,some citrus,I missed the wheat,Greene King,say no more.
Ruddles Wheat (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greene King;Bottled. Clear yellow beer without much head. It hasn't the sharp cereal taste of a German wheat but as a drink in its own right its ok, lemon, tang, crisp, quite a thirst quencher. No big faults, no great pluses, a moderate drink.
Ruddles Wheat (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greene King;Funny bottle. Nice wide-opening. Improves the easy-drinking-proporties of the bottle. I would'nt call this a wheat beer. It is absolutely not a REAL wheat beer. The appearance is quite nice. It looks very, very refreshing. BUT it is'nt. It is a bitter imitation of the great German wheats. I should have known it. Englishmen are not meant to brew wheat beers. Sorry folks, but that's how it is. Stick to the IPA, EPA, ESB, HSB and what the fuck you else call it.
Ruddles Wheat (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greene King;I hereby re-rate this beer lower than before. I still get nightmares about it... A wheat beer without the pleasant wheat characteristics. Not great - a (very) pale imitation.
Ruddles Wheat (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Greene King;Reasonable appearence for an ale (but it is suppose to be a wheat beer). For my money it tastes like a chemically enhanced ale, rather than a wheat beer.

Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;Hop malt spice aroma. Clear yelow colour with great head and lacing. Malt hop flavour with stal e aftertaste. Flat palate.
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear golden yellow color with a small bright white foamy head. Nose is straw and hay with some light corn notes. Palate is full and crisp with a light fizz. Flavor of corn and hay with some nice grassy hop notes, full bodied, rather pleasant and quite flavorful. I had low expectations going in and I was pleasantly suprised.
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;Has a clear straw yellow gold pour with a small wispy white head that collapses to a ring and sparse cover, mild effervescence, aromas of faint malt and grassy hops, some corn? Flavor of light malt and hop bitterness on the palate with a faint field herb flavor &#40from the hops?&#41, has a thin mouth feel, ok drink.
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;Bottle. Poured a very pale gold with a green tint and minimal head. The Aroma was weak as well with some grainy notes. Flavor was non existent, seriously tasted a bit like carbonated water.
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;"Part three of """"Clean out the drawer of my beer fridge"""". Pours a very light gold in color. Very cloudy and no head. Smell is very vegetal and corn like. Very off. Taste is very much the same. It�s not very often that a craft beer makes me want a Bud, but this is severly lacking. Not good."
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;"light straw color, with a dominant bready and ""lager-like"" aroma. this beer belongs in a can; not bad, but it certainly doesn�t distinguish itself from any other beer in its class."
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;"Pours a clear golden, lightly carbonated, and thin. It smells pretty weak too--I can perhaps pick up some very light caramel malts. However, the taste is what keeps me from classifying this as a plain macro clone. The malt is much more discernible with the malt aftertaste also being more apparent compared with a macro lager. I tend to go for the heavier brews, but as far as ""pale lagers"" go, I�d much rather drink this guy. It�s got a much more satisfying flavor than the macros do."
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;"Crystal clear coloured body with a thinnish white head. Aroma of skunky pale malt and a bit of old hops. Light-bodied; Strong malty flavour with some mild fruity tastes, some skunky hops and a nice cardboard finish! Aftertaste, just as bad - this one is definitely not showing any complexity. Overall, a pretty bad beer - but if you are polish or in that area in Detroit, try this one out. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from a store off Jos. Campau in Hamtramck (Detroit), Michigan on 25-December-2007."
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;Draft at new brewpub. Poured clear amber color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Moderate hoppy aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Medium biitersweet flavor with a small bitter finish of moderate duration. Drinkable basic brew.
Hamtramck Beer;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Michigan Brewing Company;Bottle... Lightly hazy straw-colored lager with a mid-sized, fizzy, white head. Great, creamy retention. Breadsy, sweet nose and flavor with hints of butterscotch and honey. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Sweet, yeasty finish. Not much in the way of hops, but I like all the breadsy yeastiness. Nice Polish-style lager! I�m gonna go against the grain and say if I lived in Michigan, I�d drink this beer every day other day! You see, this is the reason I keep trying all these damned pale lagers. I refuse to give up and it finally pays off!
Three Needs Alstadt Alt;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;My Bottom Line: Potent herbal hops refresh the butterscotchy caramel malts of this very quaffable yet strangely dextrinous Altbier. Further Personal Perceptions: -A thin veil of foam sinks into the cloudy amber. -This is a lot hoppier than traditional examples of the style. -Spicy, herbal bitterness attemps to balance out the plump caramel. -A crisper mouthfeel (better attenuated) would have been smashing with these hops. On tap at the brewpub.
Three Needs Alstadt Alt;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;On tap at the brewpub. Amber in color with a very small off white head. Aroma is very bad- unfermented wort and some stressed yeast(rubber) in the background. Taste is sickeningly sweet with alot of unfermented wort. To make matters worse, in the mid palate and finish there is alot of phenolicy band aid- and rubber. It seems like the yeast was in very poor shape, or there just was not enough pitched. I couldn�t believe that a brewer would actually put on this on tap for the public to consume. Nasty, this is definitely one of the worst commercial beers I�ve ever had.
Three Needs Alstadt Alt;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours coppery with a small white head. Smells slightly biscuitty and earthy. Tastes of earthy hops and caramel malt.

Three Needs Alstadt Alt;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;GABF 2002: Orange amber color. Sweet and mildly flavored, with a creamy palate.
Three Needs Alstadt Alt;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"On tap at the pub. Medium-red color, very clear, with almost no head. Very little nose; perhaps a slight wet earthy tinge, but hard to tell with all the bar smoke. Flavor: no malt to speak of when I first took a sip; I realized after about 1/3 of the glass that it had to warm up; when I allowed it to, interesting earthy/piney flavors came out and a subtle semi-sweet maltiness. How can a pub that brews its own beers (and has a good rep hereabouts) serve something like this at 40 degrees? An interesting effort all around, not that good but possibly worth trying again under better (warmer/less smoky) circumstances."
Three Needs California Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Fresh, citrusy, orange blossom, floral, hop forward aroma with some underlying grainy malt character. Hazy amber tan coloured body with a low white head that recedes to a thin but persistent cover and ring with some fine lacing. Moderately bitter in the mouth with herbal, leafy, floral, citrus-orange hops and some underlying fresh, sweet, toasty and biscuity malt character. Medium light body is refreshing with lively effervesence to keep the tongue involved. I could easily imagine having many pints of this. Sampled on tap at the brewpub with beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, muzzlehatch, Rastacouere and Yowie.
Three Needs California Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Nicely unfiltered hazy orange with a light white cover. Hoppy nose retaining hallmarks of C-hops, yet with lean malt backings. Leafy in mouth with a surprising mellow alcohol touch that warms the senses. Crisp texture blends in remarkably with the genuinely toasted feel. Light and soft bodied. Floral and leafy moreso than purely bitter, but the hop aromatics do work well in this surprising lager.
Three Needs California Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;The Lure: C-hops float atop the fresh malt biscuits. Oranges and citrus fruit are slowly candied, and flowers emerge diplomatically. The Festivities: Gorgeous biscuity malts create impressive balance with the citrusy, flowery hops. This hoppiness continues into an aftertaste which is never agressive and commends quaffing. An expansive flavor display amidst soothing drinkability. Transcendence: A set of comfy cushions.
Three Needs California Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours a cloudy amber color with a thin white head. Good aroma of fruits, hops and malt. The flavor is good with a nice balance between the malt and hops, it�s fruity too, the finish is bitter. The palate is light and creamy and the carbonation is soft. A good, well-balanced lager.
Three Needs California Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Light sweet beany malt aroma. Good hops note, fruity but not harsh. A smooth lager aroma. Reddish amber clear with off-white creamy thin lacing head. Light to medium watery body with mild-medium carbonation. Starts with medium sweetness, light malt. Caramel and toasty notes. Watery profile, light but not quite crisp in taste. Fruity finish with good bittering. Mild nutty bitter after. A decent lager.
Three Needs California Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Jan 2003: OK boring mainstream lager, a little hoppier than most, fairly decent sweetish fruity flavors, but nothing to get excited about. Right now the pub has this, the California Common, and the Roggen on tap -- not a lot of difference between them all. Three lagers? Come on. 5/3/6/2 10 2.6 Dec 2005: �bout time I rerated this, now that I�ve gotten more into lagers and all. Martin really describes it much better than I can...the lovely Cascades, or whatever PNW hops are used, are dominant throughout but beautiful dry lager body and grassy, malty undertones let you know this ain�t no IPA...supremely drinkable, with a light and ethereal finish...one of the best ""daily drinkers"" at Three Needs, easy, and one of the better lagers I�ve had in a long while."

Lucknow Porter;Moultonborough, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Castle Springs Brewing Co. - Lucknow;Very smooth drinking porter. I agree with others that said it had a bit of extra hops, but I think that was Lucknow's modus operandi. When in doubt, toss in more hops! It works for this beer, though, and I remember this beer as if I drank it yesterday.

Lucknow Porter;Moultonborough, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Castle Springs Brewing Co. - Lucknow;Typical dark color, with tan head, for a porter. Arome caught me off guard with a flowery, hippy smell...a little strange for a porter. Was thin bodied, unfortunately, possibly because of the abundance of hops. The finish was decidely bitter. It's still good, but tasted like a porter with extra hops.
Lucknow Porter;Moultonborough, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Castle Springs Brewing Co. - Lucknow;Toasty, chocolatey, slightly astringent. In need of more body and complexity. Standard at best.
Lucknow Porter;Moultonborough, New Hampshire, United States;Porter;Castle Springs Brewing Co. - Lucknow;I love hoppy brews and this porter is no exception. I totally disagree with the beers description that this is a British Porter as they seem to measure out hops by the gram, rather than some American brewers that measure it by the shovel. If you love hoppy porters, seek this out. Oh wait, Lucknow is ceasing production in a few weeks, never-mind.

OB Blue;Seoul, South Korea;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Oriental Brewery (AB-InBev);Drank this while stationed in Korea when i was in the Army. To cut to the chase it taste like Busch or Bud. It was a tad cheaper than Bud when I was hitting the bars, but was that really Bud anyway? Soju kettles were often the social norm when out in the Ville, but as a connoisseur of beer more than liquor I tossed back quite a few of these. Hell you could a can out of a vending machine in the barracks for 75 cents so this pretty much pored through my veins while being held captive in the land of the morning calm.

Thanks a million, Alex, for sharing this very special beer with me."
B�re-Br�u Hopfenbombe Tribute to Cascade;Bern, Switzerland;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;B�re-Br�u;"Draught, 2002-06-03, 10-5-8-5-17 The brewer: 'This beer is brewed under Reinheitsgebot purity law, using only Cascade hops'. Amber/orange ale. Wonderful fruity aroma: apricots, plums... Aggressive hop taste, the residual sweetness (however evident) is overwhelmed. A lot aromatic. Strong and long palate, both bitter and aromatic. This brew respects what its name promises: not really refined, but a real Hop Bomb; two hours later, I still taste the hop. 53 IBU Bottle 2 years old, 2004-01-28, 9-5-8-4-17 Cloudy light amber oclor. Nice hop aroma, yeasy and cheesy; fruity but much more complex than the fresh one. The body is thinner, but still very good, and a bold bitterness (shorter)."
B�re-Br�u Hopfenbombe Tribute to Cascade;Bern, Switzerland;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;B�re-Br�u;a test beer made only with Cascade hops, this beer is a sort of bottom fermented IPA - bronze colour, giant head, deep and very impressive fruity (mango and apricot) and floral nose, smooth, extremly bitter, lot of character, infinite bitter and floral aftertaste - you can forget about being able to taste something else after this one ! - this beer is not really about balance but I love it !
Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;Donkergeel bier met schuim. Gedronken in �t Boshuisje. Smaak is licht zoetzuur, licht bitter met iets van vanille. Mooi bier perfect in balans.

Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;Een goed bier en als je zoals in t Boshuisje doet: dit bier gemixt met kriekenbier (ze geven het uit onder de naam: Zoete Vlaamse Meisjeskus) is het een perfecte combinatie
Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;Clear golden colour, white head. Malty aroma, tetra hops character. Quite sweet, malty flavour, light bitterness. Sweet finish. Not the best blond around, I do agree with �uninspired�. It was slightly better in �Witte van Zoersel� (mix of Loteling Blond and Hoegaarden). When at �t Boshuisje do not forget to try their �rijsttaart� though, it�s brilliant. (Draught @ �t Boshuisje, Zoersel)
Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;On tap at �t Boshuisje, Zoersel. Clear golden, medium head. Fruity and sweetish. A bit uninspired, if you ask me.
Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;A nice triple tasted from draft in �T Boshuisje Zoersel, had also a 82 bottle this year that was still ok. Also they offer some combo beers. A witte of zoersel for example is a combination of loteling blond and Hoegaerden
Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;Blonde with a touch of orange. Vinous aroma with toffee. Sherry flavor with toffee and a touch of cherry. Tastes like it is oxidated somewhat. I�ve tasted Loteling blond from Van Assche in Liezele in the past. That was, as far as I can remember, quite a decent beer. This one isn�t.
Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;(Bottle 33 cl) Muddy grey, unpleasant colour with a fairly decent head. Nothing wrong with the flavour though: some caramel, with fruity, yeasty notes. Some sweetness from the candied sugars. Very soft mouthfeel. 070298
Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;Golden with a big white disappearing head. Aromas are candy, sugar, yeast and lots of spice. Flavours are candy malts with fruit and then lots of hops spice on the end of the tongue. Not bad.
Loteling Blond;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Huyghe;Slightly darker than yellow colour. Refreshing yeasty, clovy aroma. Good bitterness. Tea-like flavour.
La Sierrvoise Blanche;Sierre, Switzerland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Sierrvoise;It is a regular weissbier. I bought it at the Leman Center and I drank it with friends in Lausanne. The body is typical, yellow, gold and troubled. The taste is with wheat and there is a side bitter and citrus. It is a right beer for the summer, easy to drink.
La Sierrvoise Blanche;Sierre, Switzerland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Sierrvoise;Bottled 250ml. -from Coop Sion Switzerland. Batch or bottle No.210. Hazy yellow coloured, small white head that went away fast, mild yeasty nose. Wheaty, yeasty, weak spicy and caramel with notes of coriander and fruits. Watery with mild lemony finish.
La Sierrvoise Blanche;Sierre, Switzerland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Sierrvoise;25cl bottle, 5,2% ABV, batch N�201. Clear, or hazy when you pour the dusty yeast. Head disappears fast for a witbier. A bit thin in taste. Faint taste of hay. Not comparable with Belgian witbier�s in terms of taste-experience, but good enough to order a second one.
La Sierrvoise Blanche;Sierre, Switzerland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Sierrvoise;Light yellow, hazy. Small white head, fizzy, not lasting very long. No lacing. Smells of citrus, banana. Tastes of banana, sweet, spices. Very light acidity and bitterness. Dry aftertaste. Decent.
Free State Mammoth Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Free State Brewing Company;Beer of the gods. I must depend on memory since this is only available at the brewery as far as I know. The best beer I have every had. Very strong, fresh tasting, and good.
Free State Mammoth Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Free State Brewing Company;One of Free State's top three or four beers. I was especially impressed by the aroma, usually not an area in which FS excels...malty, bready, cantaloupe, subtle...with just a hint of cinnamon as an anchor. Flavors were full and mouth-expanding, light caramel malts blended with pears and wheat. Just a touch of lemon cake rounded things out a bit. Rich yet smooth with a bit of a hop bite to offset the pervading creamy maltiness.
Free State Mammoth Pale Ale;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Strong Ale - American;Free State Brewing Company;Lightly fruity/citrusy aroma. Honey-colored ale, with a more than usual amount of effervescence, but an even, slight head. Initial flavor is of some piney, resiny hop flavors, mingling with a light citrusy taste and some Caramel malt sweetness. Great balance and mouthfeel...almost creamily smooth. The finish is a bit long and hoppy, but without any sort of hop bite...just lightly fades away. Mmmm...Imperial Pale Ale...

Florida Brewing Gator Lager;Auburndale, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Brewery, Inc (Empresas Polar);"The label is kind of hokey, "" European flavor without the bitterness"" yet it also states "" The beer with a bite,"" which is it? I dont know about European but it does have a English aroma and taste with a grassy, musty Fuggle hop character or it is just old and musty. Seems like one of those beers you only see in those assorted packages. I�ve had worese."
Florida Brewing Gator Lager;Auburndale, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Brewery, Inc (Empresas Polar);"In the bottle at the 2004 Crescent Moon Vintage Beer Tasting. Okay. This was in a green glass bottle and approaching 15-20 years old. Need I say more? What description other than skunky would have to be ""light"" and ""sucks."""
Florida Brewing Gator Lager;Auburndale, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Florida Brewery, Inc (Empresas Polar);I had this beer many years ago at one time when I was too lazy and stupid to write my thoughts. I will update this as soon as I get my hands on this beer again.

Six Rivers Moonstone Porter;McKinleyville, California, United States;Porter;Six Rivers Brewery;"""started out very nice, but had an ever so slight vegetal sourish aspect that took away from it, more in the flavor than aroma. otherwise, a well above average porter...big roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. thin bodied and smooth. still something i might get again.

Six Rivers Moonstone Porter;McKinleyville, California, United States;Porter;Six Rivers Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. A: a very attractive ans creamy tan head leaves plenty of sticky lacing. Clear but nearly opaque dark brown. Aroma: mix of medium- and dark-malts with a touch of coffee. Flavor: Faint hop presence. Mix of medium- and dark-malts with dark chocolate and a touch of coffee. Feel: light-medium body with medium soft carbonation. O: well-crafted. Sits between a traditional and a robust porter.
Six Rivers Moonstone Porter;McKinleyville, California, United States;Porter;Six Rivers Brewery;Bottle. Aroma is nut and toast with a pretty simple and medium bodied and mostly sweet malty taste. Not very complex and seems a little young.
Six Rivers Moonstone Porter;McKinleyville, California, United States;Porter;Six Rivers Brewery;While not a big Porter drinker, I can certainly appreciate this one, especially ice cold and fresh from the tap. Almost black in color with a tan head, fairly robust, but not overpowering. Hints of chocolate malt come through, and pairs wonderfully with BBQ.
Six Rivers Moonstone Porter;McKinleyville, California, United States;Porter;Six Rivers Brewery;"(12oz bottle courtesy of Ken) While a smokey nose prevails, roasted grains, and chocolate are also in attendance. A blackish-brown pour with a 1/2"", rapidly dissipating, tan head and abundent lacing. The flavor has a moderate roastiness supported with hints of chocolate, caramel and grail. Medium body with medium carbonation. Mostly a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, I enjoyed this porter and am glad I have 5 more bottles to imbibe."
Six Rivers Moonstone Porter;McKinleyville, California, United States;Porter;Six Rivers Brewery;Pours a finger of tan head on a dark brown colored body. The aroma is roasted malt, cocoa and a little coffee. Mellow but nice. The taste has a roasted malt beginning, mild bitter middle and a slightly sour finish. It�s disjointed. I�m not sure the sour flavor is intended but it doesn�t really fit well. The texture is crisp with soft edges and moderate carbonation. The sour flavor took this one off the rails for me.
Six Rivers Moonstone Porter;McKinleyville, California, United States;Porter;Six Rivers Brewery;9 July 2013, bottle. Dark ruby. Nose is rich, slightly bitter dark chocolate. Thin body and fizzy. Thin, slightly oily, chocolate malt. Nice. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Southampton Double Ice Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Southampton Publick House;This is for the 2009 release. I�ve been hanging onto this forever, figure I�d finally open it and enter a rating for the first time in a while. Pours copper with a thin wispy head, which is a welcome sign as I expected zero carbonation. Nose is malt-forward, with ripe apples, pears, pie crust. A good late summer into fall beer reminiscent of other ice bocks and even some maltier Octoberfest beers. Mouth is nicely prickly. Again all kinds of big malt flavors, much in the range of stewed apples and pie crust. Faint oxidation on the finish but it�s not much of a detractor. Thick, pleasantly sweet but not nearing cloying. Nice stuff, not sure I�d trade a ton for another bottle but it�s an enjoyable rare treat!
Southampton Double Ice Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Southampton Publick House;Bottle #11 little 7oz nip thanks to Toby. pours out a golden, copper color.

Southampton Double Ice Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Southampton Publick House;Poured from a 187 ml bottle. Bottle # 17/110 vintage 2014. Aroma is rather malty with lots of caramel, burnt sugar and bit of toffee. Some moderate honey notes with a bit of alcohol. Medium raisin and other dried fruits. Pours a hazy, reddish copper color with a small, thin, whit head that recedes to a thin film that lingers in the center. No lacing and long legs. Flavor is fairly sweet with some caramel, burnt sugar and light toffee notes. Quite a bit of alcohol spice. Lots of honey and apple juice oxidation with a touch of wet paper. Medium bitterness. Light raisin and fig notes. Hints of dried stone fruit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with almost no carbonation. Low astringency and medium high alcohol warmth. Overall, an interesting beer but not great. Lots of alcohol and it tastes a bit oxidized. Some decent fruit notes, but it seems to lack the complexity necessary to hide so much alcohol.
Southampton Double Ice Bock;Southampton, New York, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Southampton Publick House;Bottle at clockworks this was a beer I wanted to try since I first joined site and got into beer so happy that approx 2600 beers later I got to have.

Heartland Full Moon Barleywine;Brooklyn, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Greenpoint Beer Works;22-Apr-08 (12-oz bottle: Free bottle for stewarding the 2008 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) Entered into the American Barley Wine category, the brewer has indicated 18 months of aging in stainless steel kegs. Extremely malty and toasty nose with wood, flowers, butter, anise and alcohol in the background, but an aroma of decaying organic matter (fruity and woodsy, but not earthy) detracts from the overall aromatic impression. The entry is very fruity and fairly sweet, though not sugary or cloying, and this lasts well into the finish. Hops are very much on the perfumy side, and offer mild bitterness. Malty as it is, the toastiness of the aroma doesn't really pan out until the finish. A nice smoky character emerges in the finish as well. Hops are floral in flavor and light-medium in bitterness. Notes of hot alcohol are present in the flavor and mouthfeel. Medium-full bodied with light-medium carbonation. Ruddy-amber to light-brown in color, moderately cloudy in appearance, and capped by a filmy, off-white layer of bubbles that fully dissipate. Overall, a complex barley wine showcasing some unusual flavors for the style, but there are enough off-flavors to pass this beer by.
Heartland Full Moon Barleywine;Brooklyn, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Greenpoint Beer Works;This barley wine is missing something. The look is ok but that�s about it. It seems to be missing any kind of hop aroma or flavor. My assumption is this is an attempt at an American style barley wine. If it�s trying to be English, it�s completely missed boat. Would not have again. Heck, not likely to finish the glass I have.
Heartland Full Moon Barleywine;Brooklyn, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Greenpoint Beer Works;Nitro at 43rd st shop. Copper mahogany, thick creamy head. Creamy, sticky sweet. A little orange, and alcohol. Strong English bitter, given the treatment. Minty. Odd, not great.

Heartland Full Moon Barleywine;Brooklyn, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Greenpoint Beer Works;On tap. This barley wine hid its alcohol very well, but you can feel it creep up on you. It tasted of roasted nut and dark fruits. Had a medium sweeter mouth feel. Not much carbonation to be seen. It finished nice and clean, was almost to easy too drink. It was a bang on barley wine.

Heartland Full Moon Barleywine;Brooklyn, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Greenpoint Beer Works;Draught @ Times Square location: this one pours a clear amber color. There was about 1 finger of an off white head that left a bit of lacing. It has a pretty good nose. A fair amount of citrus/grapefruit hops are on top. Sweet malts in the background. Definitely a hoppy bite to the tatste. The malt sweetness is fairly well masked. Decent body to it. Not bad!
Heartland Full Moon Barleywine;Brooklyn, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Greenpoint Beer Works;On tap. Pours with a mildly hazed copper hued body with a stray, fading, off-white head. Aromas are of alcohol, burnt caramel, toffee, sticky, overripe fruits, orange, marmalade, and a bit of herbal, nearly minty (hop?) notes (northern brewer?). Flavors are of caramel, herbal, sweet toffee. Super malty. Very long duration. Orange, ripe fruit, sweet, estery, alcoholic. Syrupy on the mouthfeel, with medium bubbles. Warming. Big body on this one.

Beer Works Imperial Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Works;Draft @ Canal St. location on 7 June 2013 before the Bruins vs. Penguins Game 4. Pitch black with tan head in the snifter. Flavor starts heavily sweet with lots of chocolate, then finishes moderately sweet and lightly bitter. Palate is medium, to full, with a syrupy texture and has a soft carbonation and a moderately alcoholic finish. The carbonation gives the mouthfeel of this Imperial Stout a nice creaminess. Really nicely surprised by this brew. I would order this again. And a stout drinker should give it a try.
Beer Works Imperial Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Works;On tap at the Canal Street location on 6 April 2010 in a Tulip glass. Listed on the board as Russian Imperial Stout but no mention barrel-aging, so I guess it was this one. Difficult to be certain as there was no ABV given and I couldn�t find it listed on the Beer Works website as one of the April (or March) beers. Black as night. Surprisingly modest aroma. Quite fruity flavour. Some roasty notes with a noticeable bitterness and fairly understated coffee. Subtle burnt & smoky elements. Quite light and easy-drinking for an imperial stout. Still enjoyable.

Willimantic Rural Route Red;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at brewery. 5oz sample. Aroma is a bit citric with some mild roastiness that is somewhat faint. Transparent copper/amber color. I would expect this to be more reddish in color. Metallic, rusty maltiness in the middle with some peppery spiciness in the end and somewhat piney-hoppy in the end as well. Chocolate roasts roll in late after the hops have subsided. The body is thin and lacking. The flavors just don�t jive, which gives this a weird mouthfeel and makes it less than enjoyable.
Willimantic Rural Route Red;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;"Sample, on cask. Murky reddish-brown, no head. Sweet, slightly grapey nose. Light and sweet, with a tart apple foundation; tart long finish with some nice smoky bitterness towards the finish. Not a fan of ""red"" ales generally, this is above average for me."
Willimantic IPA 2002;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;A gentle IPA. Loaded with hops but not as over the top as usual. A good session brew with enough hops and malt sweetness to keep you wanting more.
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Another great IPA from willibrew. Tons of grapefruit and heavy citrus bring out a brightness and drinkability. The base malts are light and doughy and provide a light sweetness that helps not make it astringent. YUMMY
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Draught @ Brewpub: This one pours a cloudy, orangish amber color. There was about no head on it at all. It has a nice nose. Grapefruit, tropicl fruits and a hint of pine. The taste is good. Some bitterness, grapefruit hops with a lot of the malts and sweetness coming through. A really decent brew.
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pretty light in flavor, had a hint of grapefruit. However, I just had a grapefruit sour candy and that tasted slightly better. I would not be able to finish a pint of this.
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery, heavy grapefruit flavors the booze comes through a little bit
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Big raging aroma of tropical fruits, papaya, lime, pineapple sauce, and lychee. Strong and incredible that it came from hops. Pours a super dingy dark amber, with no head. Flavors are just as spot on as the aroma, with a proper amount of malt sugar, not too much, not too little, to back up the big swath of hops. This really made up for the lack luster Flower Infusion and really drove home the talk that Willi�s specialty is hopwork. It shows here.
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler. Aroma lightly resinous with lots of pollen-like floral notes as well as tropical fruits. Flavor continues to exhibit nice hop character with full caramel malt as well. A bit sweet, detracting from the hops, but still a nice one.
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler from the brewpub. Pours a clear dark amber with a small white head. Aroma of garlicky hops, grassy hops, tropical fruits, sweet caramel malt. Flavor of citrusy hops, hop oils, sweet caramel malt. Sweet and malty. A little heavy for an IPA, but enjoyable. 7/4/7/4/15[ 3.7/5]
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Sweet and full aroma of citrus and hops. This is a good swisher brew, with complex palate. At times, the hops are citrus-like and at others, spicy w/ a kick. A good IPA that gets better as it warms to room temp.
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;on tap at brewpub. Color is a beautiful dark orange with small head. Aroma of sour grapefruit, citrus and flowers. Very nice. Flavor was nice blend of citrus and slight sweetness. Finishes a bit muted, but overall very pleasant. This is my favorite Willimantic IPA so far!) 3.7.
Willimantic Junk Mail IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pours amber with a thin off white head. Smells of perfume, pronounces resin, some grapefruit, dry malt. Tastes of dry malt with a nice resiny character and a hint of bitter citrus and perfume on the finish. Another masterful IPA from these guys.
Mont-Blanc La Blanche;La Motte Servolex, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mont-Blanc;Hazy golden with a frothy but fast dissipating head. Smell of orange peel, coriander and wheat with a hoppy overlay. Sweet malty taste with orange peel and coriander notes in the background. Strong carbonation.

De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;Bottle 1 year overdue in an old beer tasting. Over his top. But the beer was still ok
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;Draught. A dark brown beerwith roasted slightly smokey barley malt aromas. fruity and sweetly malty flavour with a dry hoppy finish.
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;Bottle. Hazy brown colour. Grey-brown head which disappears quickly. Acidic-sour aroma with coffee and hops. Also, I have to agree with RichardGretton on the slightly soapy aroma. The taste is bitter with a distinct licorice flavour. Hoppy. Acidic. A bit watery and way too much carbonacid. A bit disappointing as I remember it being better the first time I tried it, and went all the way to Nantes to get it again (okay, I was going that way anyway, but still :-) ). I think this could be really good beer with a better palate (read: less carbonacid).
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;Quite different from other French beers as I believe it is brewed by an English couple. And a good beer it is, too. This is full of biscuity malt body that has fruit and caramel. Nice deep finish with a roast character and good dryness.
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;Dark brown/black beer with a slightly soapy aroma (I think it is the nut aroma that other reviewers are on about). Very hopped and watery with a touch of that strange nut taste again and a very dry finish. Overall I was disappointed with this beer.
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;Bottle conditioned. Deep chestnut colour, moderate head and condition. Fruity roast barley aromas that become smokey as it warms. Low roast barley, chocolate, oak and hops in the mouth and a dry roasted finish with some woodiness and a lingering hoppiness. Like a Scottish ale but brewed in France.
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;A bottle conditioned brown ale.Initial bitterness is followed by a mellow nutty brown taste. This shares a lot in commmon with the Belgium browns. Interesting label for an interesting beer.
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;darkish cinnamon brown, swimming with particulate matter. the head jumped the gun and nearly soused my keyboard, i had to suck it out of the bottle to preclude a disaster, (that''s about all the drama i can handle these days) obviously this brewski was hot to trot, and i was thirsty, so we cut the foreplay and got to chuggin. i wished we could have gone all night, but i only had one bottle and it was over too soon. a peanut colored head with big sasparila-like bubbles lasted longer than the beer itself. aroma and flavor verrrrry nutty, almond butter and hazelnut, toasty and a light maple sweetness with a coffee like- bitterness from ample hops. that was sweet. mind if i smoke now?
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;brown colour, big creamy head, deep biscuit and coffee aroma, bitter with a long dry coffeeish aftertaste - very nice and complex
De la Soif Contrebandier;Nantes, France;Brown Ale;De la Soif;"Dark brown color, generous head. Ordinary malt aroma. Quite strong body: malt, caramel, roasted malt. Palate quite strong as well; too much yeast."
De la Soif Willy Wolf;Nantes, France;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De la Soif;Golden amber coloured, medium sweet beer with some nutty flaours. A fruity aroma with a well balanced biter finish.

De la Soif Willy Wolf;Nantes, France;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De la Soif;Light yeasty barnyard aroma with citrusy bitter notes. Hazy dull amber with some fine particulate floating in it, with rocky-foamy white lacing head. Medium watery body with medium-high carbonation. Light bitter start, mild sour mash taste, with some decent citrus notes. No sweetness, with light acidity. Finish is chalky and bitter, with citrus sourness. After is chalky with some barnyard funk. Overall is a bit watery.
De la Soif Willy Wolf;Nantes, France;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De la Soif;Hazy, amber hue, pour with a long ftothy head, sweet roasted malt, bitter chocolate, buckwheat and a hint of sweetness in the aroma, that follows through mallow medium-bodied palate whit a sweet burnt caramelized malt accent. Finishes with light hoppy note, a very pleasant french beer to drink
De la Soif Willy Wolf;Nantes, France;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De la Soif;Sampled at Le Sois Bock in Paris, France. Peach. Mildly aromatic but very easy to describe. Hints of apricots, almonds, noodles, salt, mandarin oranges and toasted malts. Dry. Balanced. Medium bodied. Notes of peach, melon, white candy sugars, noodles and a robust and malty finish. I enjoyed this. It was great as a palate cleanser when trying a bunch of bigger beers as well.
De la Soif Willy Wolf;Nantes, France;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De la Soif;A bottle conditioned blond ale certainly different to the average French beer.Slightly hazy appearance with hints of fruit.

Le-Brewery Odo;Joue-Du-Bois, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Le-Brewery;"750 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense and rocky tan head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, brown bread, herbal, grass, pear, apple, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, brown bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, light fruitiness, and roast/yeast earthiness. Slight earthy hop/roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop/yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English milk stout. All around good complexity and robustness of roasted/bready malt and moderate earthy hop/yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
Le-Brewery Odo;Joue-Du-Bois, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Le-Brewery;Bought from a little Calvados store in France. Apparently the brewery has now closed down and this is one of the last bottles. Pours black with a good tan head. The taste is rich, fruity and sweet at first before bitter liquorice notes on the finish. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Really very good.
Le-Brewery Odo;Joue-Du-Bois, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Le-Brewery;Bottle. Pours brown with tan head. Nose/taste of roasted chocolate, milk sugar, treacle, lightly burnt toast and soured coffee grounds in the finish. Medium body.
Le-Brewery Odo;Joue-Du-Bois, France;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Le-Brewery;Bottle from Jug and Bottle, Bubwith. Dark brown. Tan head that turns into an odd, green tinged film? Aroma is a sour, vegetal weirdness. Some blackcurrant. Some roasted coffee. Taste errs toward the sour side of all that. Smooth palate, though, and oddly quite enjoyable. Insipid, it isn�t.
Tonnerre De Brest Cuv�e 2000;Brest, France;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Tonnerre De Brest;"Amber colour, giant creamy head; bottle conditioned. Nice aroma of malt, lightly fruity and spicy (oranges, coriander, ...). Good body, smooth, sweet, malty, well balanced. Harmonious and persistent final."

Wasatch Polygamy Porter;Park City, Utah, United States;Porter;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);12 oz. can. Pours a medium, ivory, rapidly collapsing head, no lacing, over a clear dark brown (SRM 35) body.......nose is heavy roasted malts with cocoa, chocolate tones, minimal hops, balance to the malts.......taste is heavy roasted malts, with cocoa, slight chocolate tones, dry throughout, mild hop bitterness on the finish, balance to the malts......mouth feel, light body, no alcohol, slight carbonation. Easily drinkable although simple, with minimal meetings of the stated style.
Wasatch Polygamy Porter;Park City, Utah, United States;Porter;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);Poured from a can. Dark brown bordering on black. Tan head with good retention. Scent is chocolate and roast malts with a bit of nuttiness. Taste is chocolate, bread, a bit of bitterness at the end. Not quite doing it for me.
Wasatch Polygamy Porter;Park City, Utah, United States;Porter;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);From the brewery. Dark brown with a very thin head when it arrived at the table. Again 4 percent abv like everything else. Chocolate aromas. Chocolate and charcoal notes on the flavor. Slight bitterness and Smokey taste on the end.
Wasatch Polygamy Porter;Park City, Utah, United States;Porter;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);From Dec 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle(room temp) a dark brown with reddish hues and a large billowy head of foam that shrank but stayed as a solid layer for the entire session. The smell is on the light side but I can sense some chocolate and some roasted malt. The taste is also light. Some chocolate makes its way to my taste buds followed by just a touch of roastiness. That smooths out even more until the finish where I can just taste a bit of bitterness but that disappears quickly leaving very little flavour in the after taste. Bottom line: A light tasting sample of the style that is just missing a bit of oomph to make it a more drinkable Porter.
Wasatch Polygamy Porter;Park City, Utah, United States;Porter;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);12oz bottle at the Bit and Spur. Dark brown with a thin off-white head. Some cocoa notes on the nose. Flavors are light milk chocolate, some toffee, roasted malt. Light carbonation and body, thin finish. Very light style, a session porter? Great name and artwork though.

Wasatch Polygamy Porter;Park City, Utah, United States;Porter;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);On tap. It poured a brown color with an off-white head. The aroma was of roast, nuts, toffee, hops and some bread. The taste was similar to the aroma with more roast, nuts, toffee, hops, bread and a hint of chocolate. It had a light body with nice carbonation. Not bad.
Wasatch Polygamy Porter;Park City, Utah, United States;Porter;Wasatch Brewery (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);A watery taste inspite of it's is dark of appearence. Only 4,0 alcohol. Good for killing your thurst. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Went for here because most of the underage people I was traveling with were at different concourses. Had seen this before, but I think this was the first time I had tried it. Maybe way back in the day on another trip to Utah. Poured a dark brown color with 3-to-4 fingers of rocky khaki head when I got it. Serene setting underneath. Outstanding spotty lacing. Almost perfect retention. (Sight - 4.50) Smelled cocoa, milk chocolate, toffee, brown bread, nutty malts and maybe even a touch of vanilla. A tad light, but that is expected for 4.0 pct. ABV. (Smell - 3.75) Taste was not quite as good. Hard to get that much flavor into a 4.0 pct. porter I bet. Got cocoa, chocolate milk, nutty malts, light coffee, even hints of vanilla, and semi-char wood. (Taste - 3.25) Medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long slightly roasty finish. (Feel - 3.50) Not as bad as I thought it would be. Not quite as thick as I�d want it, but I enjoyed it. (Overall - 3.50) 3.52 80 B
Wickwar Mr Perretts Traditional Stout;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Stout;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;A very sticky beer. Rich, chocolatey with a slightly metallic aftertaste. Tried this one in one of the Utrecht tasting parties.
Wickwar Mr Perretts Traditional Stout;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Stout;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;Rating from an old notebook. Bottle. Black. Your sort of average dry stout with plenty of roasted barley, some sweetness somewher in there but also kind of tinny and thin.
Wickwar Mr Perretts Traditional Stout;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Stout;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;[500ml bottle supplied by ChrisP] Deep, very dark brown, almost black. Aromas of chocolate with a hint of fruit and liquorice � but only in the very background. Not that strong tastewise, but well-balanced. Dark malts to the fore, but with some fruit coming through [13102008]
Wickwar Mr Perretts Traditional Stout;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Stout;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;Bottled. Deep reddish brown colour with mediumsized beigeish brown head. Aroma is nuts, some mild dark fruits/berries as well as quite much roasted malts. Flavour is quite much the same in a nice balance. Slight dry wooden/grassy notes in the finish.
Wickwar Mr Perretts Traditional Stout;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Stout;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;had this beer at my favorite pubs in Bath, The Olde Green Tree. Dark amber, sweeter and I think better than a Guiness with musty malts and some buttery notes. On cask so no head or lacing
Wickwar Mr Perretts Traditional Stout;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Stout;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;"[Gravity cask at Chippenham Beer Festival 2009] Coffee and roastiness up front. Mouthfeel rather watery and flavours quite muted for a stout of this ABV. Dry yet sticky mouthfeel; the stickiness grows throughout, and I�m not sure I would have wanted much more. c10"
Wickwar Mr Perretts Traditional Stout;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Stout;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;Cask handpull, SIBA Champions� Fest 09. Burnt liquorice and musty hop aroma, sniff of molten tarmac. Bit thin for a 6% stout, too much cherry fruit and marzipan sneaking in at the edges, toasted nuts and sesame. Tan rim over mahogany. Thin and ordinary.

Woodfordes Great Eastern;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Woodfordes;Cask (Cambridge Blue, Cambridge) Looks like your typical golden. Aroma not far off expectation too, crisp hops. OK light malty base, with more tangy hops. Good example of a simple golden.
Woodfordes Great Eastern;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Woodfordes;Bottle. Hazy gold, flat. Faint sweet honey and caramel aroma. taste is thin, watery and disappointing. Wanted a bit of citrus. A little malt and less dryness. Pity.
Woodfordes Great Eastern;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Woodfordes;Bright yellow gold, with a multitude of yeasty flkes swirling around, and an off-white head, sweet pale malt, with a hint of fruitiness, wet straw note, graininess accent in the aroma folow through on a light-bodied palate with an earthy smooth pale malt character, with a subtle citrus flowery hops note with a faint piney accent, leading towards a watery and faint hops bittering finish. Quite a boaring beer, i was expecting much more from this beer, at 11$ a bottle.
Woodfordes Great Eastern;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Woodfordes;Cask, gravity flow @ the Fur & feather Inn, Woodbastwick, Norfolk. Summery orange gold with a very light haze to it and still in the glass. Head was there, then it wasn�t. Managed some minor lace-work though for extra credit. Aroma of cantaloupe, mango and vine-clippings lasted just on one whiff but was pleasant enough and a little spicy. Maris otter, ofcourse, in the mouth gives a nice clean malty base to some light, sweet and tangy citrus and mango flavours which culminate in the back to greet a good sharp, bitter swallow. Body is very light and it�s a little flat on the tongue. Finish is fresh, fruity, but very short. It�s sweetish, but has just enough balance to make it sessionable. A decent quaffer but not up there with the usual cream of Woodforde�s. One for a re-rate I suspect.
Woodfordes Great Eastern;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Woodfordes;Really pale sickly ale with floaties, a few bubbles of foam, and no carbonation. Light caramel malt, with notes of honey and dandelion, and catnip hops. In mouth, a hoppy water, with little malt to sustain, not bad, just not worth 11 clams! Bieropholie private imports.

Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;"amber/burnt orange body; sweet malts and subtle hops for aroma...flavor is a bit more complex than the smell...full of roasted malts, sugars, spices...VERY TOASTY...some sort of a nutty flavor as well...great palate"
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;One of the positive things I can write about Kraftbrau is that the hops work incredibly well in quite a few of their beers. This hazy orange-bodied offering is no exception, opening with a nice spicy hops nose blanketed across a toasted malt backdrop. Flower petals and perfume play off of the light, delicate caramels and fruity malt characteristics. Very cookie-like, this Oktoberfest reminds me of Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold, one of my favorite lagers. Quite drinkable. Definitely worth picking up more than a few bottles.
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;Cloudy amber color with a huge beige head. Floral hops, vinegar and honey aroma. Bread, honey, lemon and floral hops flavors. Lightly crisp feel.
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;Murky brown color with a massive (gushing out of the bottle...filling the glass) beige head. The aroma and flavor were filled with toasty and slightly smoky bread, tangy vegetable tones, and a slight hint of sourness. The feel was quite crisp...semi-dry finish. Not bad at all. Thanks BBB63.
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;Deep rust brown with no head at all. Looks like a tiny little dirty ocean with tiny waves that simply suck at brewin up a storm. But the smell is simply awesome, malty, grassy, dirty, spicy wildness. The flavor is somewhat like sucking on a coffee bean that's covered with dirt. A little bit of sourness. Leaves the mouth feeling quite dry like waking up after drinking a whole lot of Bell's Expedition Stout the previous night. OK beer from Kraftbrau and one of the better smelling!
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;Amber red hue with frothy off-white head and good lace. Aroma hints of earthy and woody character, toaste malts, bubblegum, grains, herbs, and aromatic hops. The initial taste was nutty and malty smooth with a strange spicy undertone. The finish was a bit sour and woody. Dry and lively mouthfeel. A good fest beer but nothing mind-blowing. Quaffable.
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;Draught at Kraftbrau Sept. 27th 2003... Dark amber. Woody bitter aroma that reminded me of an Indian food that I can't place. Dark beige head to match the beer colour. Nutty bitterness to the flavour By far the best Oktoberfest style beer I have ever had to date. Finishes with a creamy palate. Cheers to Vale for being a great hostess that night, made my trip to Kalamazoo quite enjoyable.
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;This beer has an outstanding nose, subtle but full of hops (hallertau, I think) and wonderfully soft malt. But several of this brewery's beers are so delicate, or are using some ingredient, that leads to easy spoilage. Sour, as in my first experiences of the Vienna. Even though it is spoiled, it is still a fine beer! I can't imagine how good it would be fresh. I'll see if any of the other bottles in the batch are better. I'm meeting withthe owner/brewer Jan. 6th...I'll ask him what's up.
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;Orange colored, small head and good nose. Nothing really to get excited about.
Kraftbrau Oktoberfest;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kraftbrau Brewery;Deep copper with a very thin head. Nose offers some sweet malts with a slighly oak-barrel aroma as it warms. Smooth malty flavors with a dry end. A decent lager, better than the other lagers offered by this brewer.

Sweet and fruity dark beer with noticeable alcohol accent. The fruitiness is likw a sweet Dessert wine, full of grape and pulp, the alcohol gives it a nasal quality.

Bluegrass Hell For Certain;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft. Deep brown pour with a thin off white head. Scent is yeast, caramel, and candy. Taste is sweet and yeasty.
Bluegrass Hell For Certain;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle Maybe this is better on tap but otherwise it is a complete train wreck. Much like some other BBC beers it comes across as confusing with no focus and flaws that are hard to mask. Aroma / Appearance - The first problem was the gushing bubbly mess that poured forth the second the bottle was opened. When it finally settled the carbonation was so active it was like looking at the bubbler in an aquarium. Mashed potatoes with lemon butter stand out in a mix that is just somehow off and unappealing. Flavor / Palate - Malt, caramel, and sugary apple crisp almost redeem the initial impression. Unfortunately it slips as the carbonation batters the palate. Even a warmth that fades softly in the back of the throat can�t save an unfocused and messy release. Drink at your own risk.
Bluegrass Hell For Certain;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;CASK! Had this on cask at12 south cask-stravaganza. Lots of chocolate, raisin, deep malt and pitted fruit. Nice and very easyonthe palate, no hint of 7.5 abv in this.

Aroma of Belgian yeast, toasted caramel malts, and a hint of hops. Flavor sweet like a Belgian ale should be, but with the yeast and hops that make it a balanced beer. One of my favorite American-made Belgian style beers.
Bluegrass Hell For Certain;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Blah. It�s just a little less spicy and more sweet than I want it to be. It�s not terrible or anything, and I didn�t mind it. I just wouldn�t spend my money on it. Luckily, the bottle I had was free!
Bluegrass Hell For Certain;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;This is a rating for the old lighter version of hell for certain, not the new brown more dubbel like style. Pours hazy golden amber with a nice off white head. Aroma is banana, spice, and light malts. Flavor is nice and malty with a good flavor of banana, light fruit and spices, not bad for a strong belgian blonde, but I think the new version may be a little better.

Schlafly Witbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Sampled on tap at the 2012 Schlafly Hop In The City festival. It poured a hazy, light golden color with fluffy white foam, somewhat lasting with lace. 100% true-to-style Belgian wit aromas and flavors. Light, grainy, tart, citrusy, peppery, reminiscent of crusty white French bread, light bubble-gum. Just a hint of coriander and orange peel. Delicious. A huge upgrade to Blue Moon.
Schlafly Witbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft at the Tap Room, served in a weizen glass. Listed on the board as �WItbier� and not just �Wit�. This has been on tap for about a month and I can�t believe I didn�t notice it the last couple times I�ve been here. Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a frothy bone white head. Aroma of wheat, banana, clove, and some unusual lactose and plastic notes. Those also showed up to a degree in the flavor, along with a medicinal note that clouded the otherwise typical banana, clove, and wheat notes. A little lemon citrus emerges. Light-medium bodied, with a wheaty mouthfeel and soft carbonation. I would have liked this a lot more without those strange notes putting this one off a little bit.

Schlafly Witbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at the Schlafly Tap Room on 9-5-09. Arrived to the table with a thin white head, light yellow haziness to it with a modest amount of carbonation. Aroma had a fair amount of coriander, lots of wheat with very light lemon/orange fruitiness to it. Flavor has the coriander spice hit first with the wheat and light banana and finishes with a very light grassy ending. Very light in density, good lacing and a fantastic head retention as you drink it down. Overall the flavors are light to go along with the mouth feel and fits the style pretty good. Pretty decent summertime brew.
Schlafly Witbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft� Murky straw-colored ale with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Great retention. The grainy, fruity, spicy aroma tenders notes of wheat, coriander, clove and banana. Medium-bodied and creamy with soft carbonation.

Some nice swirling settling as it arrived. Nice, full white head, falls slowly with with thick glass coating lacing. Aroma has clove, banana some wheat and spicy-earthy-mineral yeastiness. The taste mirrors the nose quite nicely, with good balance between the clove, wheat and the yeast notes. The earthiness is particularly evident in the finish, closing the beer out nicely. The palate was medium, and paired nicely with the Jalapeno pizza I was eating. This was a nice Wit.
Schlafly Nut Brown Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Growler from the brewery. I know I drank this because I still have the growler. Pretty sure I liked it too but the brain is somehow a bit foggy. May well be better than what I am rating.

Schlafly Nut Brown Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Rating #10 for this beer! As the description says, on cask at the Tap Room. Opaque brown pour with a light-tan colored, Guinness-like head. Great nutty, bready, sweet, malty aroma and flavor to match. Flavor also had a light caramel note to it. Dry finish. Not exceptionally easy to drink, but good nonetheless.
Schlafly Nut Brown Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Cask at Taproom, 2005- Pours a dark opaque brown, with a large, lasting head. Aroma is sweet with notes of vanilla, dark fruit, honey, and woody notes. Flavor mirrors aroma perfectly, and this beer comes across with a flavor of bourbon, and an alcohol bite to match. Great complex flavor, though not terribly quaffable.

Slightly sweet, malty aroma with a hint of nuttiness. Flavor is malty, with lots of toffee/caramel, breadiness, and some yeasty fruitiness. Fair amount of nuttiness. The dry finish has some spicy hop bitterness, which adds a bit of length. Body is on the lighter side of medium, with a crisp, acidic finish. Overall, this isn�t one of Schlafly�s better seasonals, but it�s a good, basic brown ale.
Schlafly Nut Brown Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Hop in the City '03: Golden brown orange. Sweet malty aroma with some orange candy and hops. Overly sweet maltiness, missing the deep roasted nuts of a great Brown, but a strong finish keeps this one very drinkable.
Schlafly Nut Brown Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;This rating was from the Hop In The City event where brews from the previous year were sampled (5 oz) by the attendees from kegs. THis brew poured a medium sized head of fine to large sized off-white colored long lasting bubbles that left behind a semi-transparent dark brown colored body. The aroma was malty and the mouthfeel was smooth with a slight bite to it. Its flavor was a typical malt hop one.
Schlafly Nut Brown Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;This is the third time I have entered ths damn beer into the system. Please forgive me. I am not trying to boost my rating count, I am just an idiot, that's all. A very well-done Brown. Very similar to Hex Nut on cask, though not nearly as nutty. Quaffable and delicious.

Schlafly Imperial Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;Saint Louis Brewery;07 & 08 great. Fantastic beer. Not much roast. Lots and lots of caramel. The 2010 was not as good.
Schlafly Imperial Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;Saint Louis Brewery;Notes from 12-20-2010: You know immediately that this is an Imperial Stout. Rich, dark color. Nice head (poured from tap) that lingered. Although aroma does not seem apparent at first, the pungent oak barrel caramelized sugars come forward with the sweet smell of bourbon. A crisp, clean, taste as it sits in the mouth is followed by the warm, relaxing bourbon going down. Overall, this has to be my all-time favorite beer.
Schlafly Imperial Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Imperial;Saint Louis Brewery;Pours pitch black with a small tan ring of fizz. Smells of licorice and a touch of coffee.

Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;Just a shy short of copper with more orange hues present. Head was nice for the demanding style and lacing good. Aroma was nits and caramel and toffee. Flavor followed with some bittering hops behind it all. Only demand with flavor was more hops, more better balance out that slightly cloying caramel that can come with a too malty alt that wasn�t lagered enough to clean up the finish. A nice shot at the style. Good stateside example. Mouthfeel was solid.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft courtesy of OFDA, thanks! Dark ruby maroon color, beige edge head. Aroma of subtle toast. Taste is toasted caramel. OK.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;Tasted on-tap 9/17/2011 at the Hop in the City Festival in a clean half-pint taster glass. Alt means old in German, in other words: the original cool, clean, refreshing German recipe before new-fangled lager brewing displaced it. As such, I think of alts as typically neutral, as close to lagers as you can get with ale yeast. Schlafly�s version is better than that, better-than-style. Crisp and smooth, appropriate use of German noble hops. An excellent balance of pronounced malt sweetness and noble hops. Very satisfying.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;on tap-pours a tan head and copper color. Aroma is sweet medium malt-toffee/roasty. Taste is sweet medium malt-toffee/roasty, some herbal.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft at The Tap Room served in an imperial pint glass. Pours a clear, vivid, rich amber color with a small off-white head that settles quickly into a film. The aroma is faint, but I get some toasted malts, fruits, bread, and paper. Flavor of toasted malts, bitter earthy hops, fruit, and minerals. Medium-bodied, with sharp carbonation and a crisp mouthfeel. Dry finish, with some lingering astringency. Not a bad altbier at all.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;Sampler at the W&C in Ballwin, Mo. The color was almost bright red with a white head. The aroma was caramel and hops. The flavor was a nice mix of hops and roasted malts. This was a very decent Altbier.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;Nice dark caramel amber color. A tan head. Interesting aroma of wet grain. Grain and rye flavors along with sweet malts. Tart hops underneath. It leaves an aftertaste of wood, caramel, and tart hop. An interesting and tasty beer.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;Poured copper in color with a medium head. Nice hoppy aroma with some carmel overtones. Had a dry spicy finish.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;I am going to include the caveat that for an alt beer this is pretty good. That said however I think that the hops could have been a little more prevalent and the body was pretty thin. I wanted just a little more hop assertiveness and a little bit fuller body.
Schlafly Altbier;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Saint Louis Brewery;Pours dark copper with an off-white head. The aroma has caramel malt, moderate amount of fruitiness and heavily toasted malt. Medium body with a bit of sharp carbonation that accentuates the flavor. The flavor starts with heavily toasted malt with smooth dry caramel. The finish is grainy, spicy and dry. Very enjoyable alt. (7/4/4/3/15 - 3.6) rerate for new reformulated improved version. There is not a lot to update from the original notes really, but it has been been redone and everything is better. I�d say this is easily the best US version of the style I�ve had (not that there are many). If you are in the STL area around my rerate date of this - go to the Tap Room and have it - very well done version.
Lone Star Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Lone Star Light is what it is. It's a decent cheap beer. It's not a coffee/chocolate stout, a pomegranate/coconut flavored sparkling muscato, or even a double hopped IPA. If you want those things go buy them. Lone Star Light is an ice cold cheap light beer. If you like cold cheap beer after a long day at work, you might want to try Lone Star.

Lone Star Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Not much to say here, basically watery Lone Star with even less flavor. Will not be having again.
Lone Star Light;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"16 ouncer from the Texas gas station doood! Is it, like, legal to drink this stuff while driving given the low abv and known watery qualities of American light beers? Has dissipating head but it�s still there so there�s that.Darker light yellow than usual light beers. Cardboard aroma with hints of lemon. Flavour is bready cardboard; kinda dry finish. Surprisingly okay, I mean not awful, there�s a very minor amount of beer stuff going on here to remind you that it�s supposed to be beer.... but not really a good one."

Golden and cloudy. Mild hefe aroma, not super spicy. Served with orange, so it�s difficult to separate that citrus flavor from the base beer. Tasty though!

Bios Vlaamse Bourgogne;Ertvelde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Oct 23, 2019: A small bottle from Liberty in east Vancouver. A dark reddish brown beer with moderate tan head and a fruity sour nose. It's sweetly sour on the palate. Too sweet and lacking in flavor. It's okay but only just.

Halloween Pumpkin Ale;Puurs-Liezele, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Villers (Huyghe);One of very few Halloween beers in Belgium, since 1995, made by Villers till it stopped brewing in 1998, after which Huyghe apparently continued it for a while with the original Villers label only to let it expire. Inspired by Anglo-Saxon pumpkin ales, very spicy from actually added spices and from yeast, but I could not find any pumpkin in it. Weird.
Villers Trippel;Melle, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Huyghe;Bottle purchased at Belgian supermarket and consumed in Belgium at private residence. Slight bitterness.
Villers Trippel;Melle, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Huyghe;Intense citrus. Sweet and brandy warmth. Earthiness on the aftertaste, probably from the hops.

Henry Weinhards Classic Dark;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Full Sail Brewing Company;For 4.99 six rack this dark beer hits the spot for dark beer lovers. Has a decent aroma of coffee and chocolate pours decent. Would buy it again if my pockets were low and I wanted dark beer
Henry Weinhards Classic Dark;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Full Sail Brewing Company;"It was $5.99 for a 6pack so I had to pick it up. Henry�s was always the ""fancy"" alternative when everyone else was buying 24 packs of natural ice lite in college. It had been at least 15 years since I�ve had a henry�s and it only seemed natural to pick the ""dark"" lager in hopes of superior flavor and it really delivers. Pours a clear dark brown, not quite black, not very opaque. Aroma is faint burnt coffee and light cracker. Flavor is less malty than other dark lagers, but representative of the style. There is a faint chemical taste underlying the roast. Hop flavor is minimal, body is light. Again, not a bad option if you feel like a dark beer without the acrid roast and a light body with light mouthfeel."
Henry Weinhards Classic Dark;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Full Sail Brewing Company;12 oz bottle into mug. Aroma is toasted bread. Pours a reddish dark brown with a medium head with pretty good retention and creamy lace. Taste is very porter-like. It�s sweet with a touch of tang and no bitterness. Mouthfeel is creamy. Carbonation is medium. All trace of foam and lace disappear towards the end of the glass, lowering my appearance score. Overall, not too impressive, but it is tasty. If one were to session a dark beer, this would be a perfect candidate.
Henry Weinhards Classic Dark;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Full Sail Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from New Seasons - This beer pours very dark black with a rich white head. The aroma is complex for a lager, although there is that hint of a dive-bar�s carpet smell. The roasted malts and hops are blended quite well. This is a very solid beer if you want something a little less than a porter.

Henry Weinhards Classic Dark;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Full Sail Brewing Company;This has a pretty good roasty creamy aroma. Flavor is better than the rest of the H.W. beers as well. Some roast, nuttiness, malt and cream. Actually a pretty good beer.

Koff Amber;Kerava, Finland;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);330ml bottle. Looks better than other light Koffs, but that�s the only positive thing to say.

A touch of red fruit syrup and a little burnt caramel on the finish, along with a gentle peppery bitterness. Like a cross between dunkelweiss and M�rzen.

Olvi Tumma;Iisalmi, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Olvi;33 cl bottle. Originally rated on 20090215. Pours amber color with a small head. Aroma of grain, malts and some sugar. Flavor of malts and grain.
Olvi Tumma;Iisalmi, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Olvi;Pours clear dark copper with an off white head leaving some lacing. Aroma is malty, bready, almost like m�mmi, roasted malts and sweet. Thin body. Flavor is much like the aroma with nice bitterness. Finishes short with malty and bitter aftertaste.
Olvi Tumma;Iisalmi, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Olvi;0,5l can. Pours a brown beer with light brown/off white head that never disappears completely. That is definitely a plus. Caramel and grains aroma. More of the same in the flavour with some roasted malts. Just a bit sweet. Medium carbonated.
Olvi Tumma;Iisalmi, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Olvi;Can 0,5l. Clear cola brown colour with thick white head. Easy to drink but still reasonably tasty dark beer with a good balance. Shame if Olvi has retired this. Not because this is great but they have none better.
Olvi Tumma;Iisalmi, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Olvi;500 ml can. Rated @ 25.6.2010. Dark brown colour with a white head. Aroma and flavour of slightly roasted malts and sweet caramel. Light bodied with a watery mouthfeel with soft carbonation. Decent Dunkel.
Olvi Tumma;Iisalmi, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Olvi;500ml can (K CM, Kamppi) Very deep red, frothy head. Dusty bready aroma, a touch sweet. Briefly tingly carbonation, but some of that tingle ties too closely to slightly bloody metallic mouthtaste and retronasals. Simply roasty palate, very malty, but withouth being too sweet or sticky bodied. Perhaps a bit thin Finish slightly burnt and bready, and just a tiny hint of dry papery hops. I�ve had this many times before, and for me it was a great choice for a sauna beer if the only thing accessible was finnish macros. This can falls short of what I�ve had before, I should try to see if bottles are available anywhere next time I�m in Finland, as I should rerate.
Olvi Tumma;Iisalmi, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Olvi;Not too much carbonation but it hurts my tongue, but it really doesn�t matter. Bitter finish and a bit in the mouth too, which I don�t like so much - usually - but here it melts with the malt, so it tastes mostly natural. Roasty malt, but not too much at all. Maybe a bit some sour and a bit bitter yeast. Maybe the bitter-sweet-sourness is a bit annoying, sourness on the bottom and you remember the cluster after drinking (bitterness).
Olvi Tumma;Iisalmi, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Olvi;50cl can. Poured dark brown with a thin beige head. Aroma is roasted malt and caramel, flavor is sweet caramel and malt. Quite nice dunkel.

H�ss Neuschwansteiner Helles Lager;Sonthofen, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei H�ss der Hirschbr�u;It has beautiful lasting foam and a gentle malty aroma. Lovely rich malt flavor where a little sweetness will have ample space and thus gives lager a greater experience than found in a usual average lager. Hop bitterness leaves little slow in coming, and it is positive that we therefore have time to enjoy its fresh malt has hint of a little fresh newly harvested grain. The hops are slightly markedly towards the end and put a fine edge on the whole. Obviously, an all-malt lager which only Germans brew with great precision. Carbonation is soft and it makes it easy to drink, thirst-quenching and very delicate.

This is all hops, with some sweet caramel malt in the background. Citrusy bitter hops at the start, middle and finish. If I had this out of a bottle, I would have poured the rest out.

Grabbed a bottle of this when I was in WI for the holidays. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy light gold with no head at all. Some very light lace sticks. Scents of veggies, grains, and a kiss of honey on the finish. Good crisp, clean body on this beer. Very tame and mild in the flavor dept. There is a nice hop presence though with a mild bitter kick. Some good bready flavor mixed with a sweet backing. This is what it is. Drinkability is high as it is unoffensive and tame. I, for one, liked it. Great for barbecues and campouts in the great WI outdoors.

Very hazy brown with no head. Aroma of mold, malt, caramel dark fruity notes and light wood. Flavour is above moderate sweet and light moderate bitter. Medium bodied with very soft carbonation.

No carbonation left. Vinous, soy sauce and port in aroma. Oxidated taste but still pleasant considering the age.
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Amber color that has a mildly spiced finish and hints of orange peel. Not exactly a winter beer
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Off white fully diminishing head copper coloured beer. Mild hoppiness, slight malt flavour. Dry finish. An O.K. beer but nothing really jumps out at you.
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Dark brown with good head that quickly fades to a thin lacing. Good toasted malt smell. Tastes okay, malt and brown sugar are the dominant flavours. It has quite a bit of alcohol taste.
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Copper body with little head. Aroma is slightly roasted malts. Flavour includes malts and notes of toffee but little else. Finish is slightly sweet but pretty easy.
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);clear copper colour. mild toasty and slightly soapy aroma. good dark malty flavours with hints of toffee, but overall a little thin
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Copper. Light malt and some hops in the nose. Body is oily with some roasty hops. Smooth, dries quickly.
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Bright orangey, minimal head. Soft lightly bitter aroma. Just slightly above average in all means.
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Gorgeous amber with lasting off white head. Faint malt nose. Fizzy. Bland if drank cold. As it warms the malt comes out
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Kaya - first of all, how the hell were you able to get your hands on this when your out in vermont. Second, BC winters are very mild compared to the rest of the country and where your from. Especially the Vancouver metro area, where i'm from. It rains all winter
Shaftebury Winter Solstice Ale;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Strong Ale - English;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);This beer makes a nice amber ale, but is not nearl heady enough to be classified as a winter ale (at least when compared to examples that are brewed in the U.S.). Copper, slightly brown colour. A weak brwon sugar aroma. Mild malt flavour, slightly buttery, nutty, and spicy. Not bad but fairly mild. Not nearly warming enough for a B.C. winter.
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;Sampled at Great American Beer Festival 2019 in Denver, Colorado. Malty, dark, sweet, smooth.
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;355ml can. Pours a clear red-brown with a medium, foamy, long lasting, beige head that laces. Sweet aroma of lightly roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate, earth and a hint of smoke. Sweet flavour of roasted bready malt, caramel, toffee, cocoa, raisin, peat, nuts and earthy hops in a dry finish. Light body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Ok, but nothing special.
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;Can from variety pack. Purchased in West Yellowstone. Drank while camping in West Yellowstone. Pour was brown, off white head. Aroma was malty, nut, caramel, peat. Taste was mild sweet, malts, toasted malt, nutty, caramel.
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;Pours a copper hue with a small head and little carbonation. One of the smoother Scottish ales I've had and certainly more multi-drinkable than most. Low abv so you don't get that more alcoholic bite that many Scottish ales have.
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;Draft at Grant Village restaurant. Pleasant dark Scottish ale with plenty of malt
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;12 oz can from Brewers Haven, poured into thistle. Dark brown, light peeking through, small, thin head fades to beige ring, no lacing. Aroma is peat, earthy, slightly ashy, but light. Taste is sweet, peat, smoky flavors, but weak. Thin feel too. So i can believe the low scores....rewind...temperature has everything to do here, got much better as it warmed
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;From a 12 oz. cca. Pours a clear mahogany with an ecru head. Aroma is malty, with caramel and molasses. Flavors are sweet caramel with some leather and tobacco.
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;On tap at bier thirty pours out dark cola brown topped with tan head. Nose is light pit fruit some sweet malts and a touch of spice. Taste is more of the nice sweet malts some spice and a little nutty note.
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;12 oz pour from chilled can into a tulip glass. Aggressive pour produced a weak and quickly dissipating head. Mostly opaque, nice carbonation, and brown. Nose is sweet caramel and chocolate. Medium body and fairly creamy. Taste is sweet up front with a bit of a dry finish. Caramel and toffee flavors along light coffee. An alright scotch ale, though not the best I�ve had.
Lewis and Clark Back Country Scottish Ale;Helena, Montana, United States;Scottish Ale;Lewis and Clark Brewing Company;Definitely disagree with the low rank. For a low abv Scottish style ale, this is a rich, malty slightly sweet and slightly smoky brew. Taste is smooth and rich. I dig it.
Club Colombia Dorada;Bogota, Colombia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Grupo Empresarial Bavaria (AB InBev);Many bottles consumed across Colombia. It�s everywhere. Drinking one now in bed. It�s fairly tasty if generic. Good cold.
Cristal Oro;Bogota, Colombia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grupo Empresarial Bavaria (AB InBev);This one is not already in the Colombian market. It was a different option to the lagers produced by Bavaria. The taste was quite regular for a macro lager with nothing special to give.
Cristal Oro;Bogota, Colombia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grupo Empresarial Bavaria (AB InBev);Like the bud light of Belgium. Not that tasteless, but nonetheless easy to drink and not exceptional, just a good all around beer, cheap nice a lil zest and crisp bread, and water taste. Have one, my wife is sold on it.
Cristal Oro;Bogota, Colombia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grupo Empresarial Bavaria (AB InBev);Bottle via PUB�N. Pours pale gold with 1-finger white head. Nose is pale malt, hopcitrus, mild thiols. Tastes pretty good, with pale malt, hops, apricotty fruit. Fairly smooth and decent complexity. This one isn�t too bad at all.
Cristal Oro;Bogota, Colombia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grupo Empresarial Bavaria (AB InBev);My bottle was also labeled as Colombian Gold and I couldn't find 'Cristal Oro' anywhere on the bottle or packaging, so let's hope this is the same beer. In terms of categorical relevance, it doesn't really taste like any other Classic German Pilsener I'ver ever had. Not much aroma at all, but the beer itself is a little light and side by side with a Corona (which I perhaps wrongly assumed all of these Latin American golden beers taste the same) it tastes sweet and buttery with relatively no bitterness. Little to no head. I'd actually rather drink a Corona because it has more flavor - with the lime of course. In all fairness I'll re-rate this when I know I've found a fresher pack.
Cristal Oro;Bogota, Colombia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grupo Empresarial Bavaria (AB InBev);I'm rating this under the assumption that this is the same beer that's marketed in the US as 'Colombian Gold' from the same brewery. Decent tropical pilsener. A little adjuncty smelling, but not too noticable. Sweet, light, a little hoppy. Smooth and drinkable, so crack a cold one with the 3rd World strongman of your choice.
Cristal Oro;Bogota, Colombia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grupo Empresarial Bavaria (AB InBev);For coming in a different can than Club Colombia, this is pretty much the same beer. Not that it's a bad thing - despite the light body, this is a refreshing hoppy lager - nice, crisp, north German.
Cristal Oro;Bogota, Colombia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grupo Empresarial Bavaria (AB InBev);"Head is initially small, frothy, white, fully diminishing. Body is medium yellow, fair density of small and medium sized particles. Aroma is moderately malty (light bread, cereal), lightly hoppy (herbs). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter, lightly salty. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter. Medium body, dry and syrupy texture, lively carbonation. It's perhaps a little corny and sweet, but at the same time there is substantial bitterness in the finish and a pretty full mouthfeel for the style. My bottle is labeled ""Columbian Gold"" (by Cerv. Leona), but I'm sure that's what this entry references."
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Pours a muddy brown with no head. Thick and heavy of the palate. Rich caramel malts, brandy finish.
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;The big daddy. Thickest beer I�ve had. Strong but silky texture. Like a meal in a can.
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Pours ruby gold with off white superfine head. Aroma of malts. The soft mouth feel reveals a beer of great balance. Malt, caramel, hints of xmas pudding are all present, balanced off by some bitterness from what i assume are hops and well roasted malt. The alcohol is so very well contained that it only ever hints at its presence towards the finish and even then it is restrained (which is dangerous isn�t it!). The finish is warm and long with some malt sweetness the only unbalanced component. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Bottle from first choice. Maybe most expensive bottle there. Not sure. Recommended by old mate at work, reckoned it was the bomb. Wasn�t sure given what I�ve been able to acquire thanks to the international beer collector. However, this was exceptional. Prob best Aussie beer I�ve had. Everything I like in a big beer. Smells and tastes of caramel and toffee. Little to no head, married, used to it. Appearance of the type of water mud crabs would thrive. Never thought anything like this was available in Oz so easily, but guess I�m raw. Maybe not. Delish!!!!
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Love this beer. From a stubbie, pours a rich dark amber with of white oily head. Aroma is toffee, plum, booze, scotch, wood. Taste is sweet bread with a medium roasted bitter finish. Palate is medium, oily and smooth. Scrumptious!
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;330mL bottle from Yarragon Ale House. Pours a slightly murky deep bronze body, a creamy beige head persists. Aroma is properly rich - treacle, golden syrup, aged port with undertones of sultana, dried fig, touch of nutty rancio, undertones of milk chocolate, plummy esters, touch of booze. Thick, very sweet, syrupy, subdued carbonation, very long on the palate. The palate delivers huge truckloads of sweetness - plenty of treacle & golden syrup once again, vinous Tokay & Port-like dried fruits, slightly nutty, fruity, biscuity finish, lingering warming, bitterness is high yet pales in comparison to the sweetness. Been around a long time, well made stuff, probably a bit lost in the crowd of amazing BW�s on offer down here these days though.
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;Bottle. Cellared for 2 1/2 years. Deep murky brown, with small but attractive thick cream head. Luscious aromas of biscuit malt burnt caramel, dark brown sugar, chocolate and some fortified wine type alcohol. Sweet brown sugar and caramel dominates the front palate, moving into a roasted malt finish and noticeable, but well integrated alcohol element. I'm usually disappointed with grand ridge, but this is their best offering along with the hat lifter stout.
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;330mL bottle. Pours hazy nut brown with a thin, dense off-white head leaving a little bit of lace. Aroma of malt, biscuits, dried fruit, some acidity and a little bite from the alcohol. Caramel, toffee, golden syrup, ANZAC biscuits, high sweetness, mild bitterness and a lingering acidity. Full body, syrupy with soft carbonation and a velvety mouthfeel. Long finish.
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;330ml bottle. Pours a hazy deep amber, with a small off-white head, which lasts well without leaving much lace. Candied fruit, biscuit malt and floral hops make up the aroma. Floral and mild peppery hops up front lead into a savoury, meaty flavour. Biscuit and rye bread malt in the mid-palate lead into a candied fruit finish. Quite a nice barley wine.
Grand Ridge Supershine;Mirboo North. Vic., Australia;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Grand Ridge Brewing Co.;From a 330ml bottle on 16/8/2012. Pours a cloudy dark amber with a smallish head. Has a strong malty aroma of toffee, butterscotch and caramel. Very sweet and malty in the mouth, with more butterscotch and toffee, honey, some scotch and a touch of dark fruit. Finishes with a nice, reasonably firm, balancing bitterness. The texture is quite creamy and the 11% abv is quite well hidden. All up, this is a very enjoyable barley wine. Re-rate on 21/2/2018. Well it's six years between drinks, but I'm even more impressed. A glorious nose and a delicious toffee/butterscotch character. Just lovely.

Shepherd Neame Sun & Planet Steam Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Shepherd Neame;Bottled@8BeerQuickPicnicSession (thanks to the craziest bartender in the world!). BBE way past (2004), thanks, wherever you managed to dig this up from! Pale nutbrown colour with creamy mediumsized slightly off-white head. Aroma is quite much fruity and flowery hops along with some grass and yeast. Also some slight skunked notes, which may be due to beer being old. Flavourwise the beer is fruity and flowery hops with some slight yeasty notes as well as mild alcoholic sweetness. All in a nice balance. Both were a bit surprised how well the flavour has kept. Smooth!
Shepherd Neame Sun & Planet Steam Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Shepherd Neame;A light golden brown colour with a thick white head. A citrus nose with a hint of hops. A hoppy flavour with a dry citrus finish. An award winning ale. (Bottle).
Shepherd Neame Sun & Planet Steam Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Shepherd Neame;1. Bottle 03/01/2003 Golden amber coloured with some alcohol present. Sour fruit and malt in the finsih. 2. Bottle 12/08/2003 Golden amber coloured strong in alcohol and hoppy. Bitter slightly dry full malt finish.
Shepherd Neame Sun & Planet Steam Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Shepherd Neame;(Bottled) Amber-coppery colored with a small, somewhat lacy head. Quite mild, hoppy aroma. Sweetish, fruity and aromatic-hopped flavor with a bitter finish and some alcohol presence. Quite carbonated, medium-bodied palate. A pleasant and complex-hopped ale, but nothing to die for.
Shepherd Neame Sun & Planet Steam Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Shepherd Neame;Bottled, Pasteurised. Light copper colour with thin white head. Nice crisp malting giving a smooth mouthfeel, when you overcome the carbonation, the beer then flows into a full bitterness that warms with alcohol.
Shepherd Neame Sun & Planet Steam Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Shepherd Neame;Bottled.Very much in the Shepherd Neame style, amber with ginger tinge. White clumsy looking head. Big grassy hop presence in the glass. Dry, slight bitterness. Nice beer but nothing out of the ordinary. #Late mail, Improved in smoothness the warmer it got.
Shepherd Neame Sun & Planet Steam Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Shepherd Neame;A little gem of a find. One of the less known of the Shepherd Neame portfolio of brews, but a real treat. Smooth and tightly bound malt and hop flavours with some zesty citrus tang to finish. Can certainly feel another one coming on soon.
Shepherd Neame Sun & Planet Steam Ale;Faversham, Kent, England;Strong Ale - English;Shepherd Neame;Pure quality, what a beer! greatly enjoyable, yet still doesn''t match up to the mighty bishops finger
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Mostly odorless. Clear red amber, thin off-white head, no lace. Flavor dominated by wet cardboard. About two-thirds of the way though the pint, when my palate has become saturated with cardboard, some caramel and roasted nuts emerge. Thin on the palate. Just not a good beer.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a clear copper amber brew with a slow dissolving white head that leaves behind a nice white ring and some spotty lacing. Aroma is quite malty, caramel malt, some floral hops, a touch of brown sugar, and some tropical fruit. Taste is medium bodied, some dry caramel malt flavors with a dry grassy hop character. Finish is a little more dry than average, some tart fruit and grassy hop aftertaste. I strongly doubt this is what Lambeau Field tastes like when tackled to the ground but still an average amber ale overall.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear medium orange color with an off white head. Diacetyl aroma of butterscotch and caramel. The flavor was similar with a little flowery hop mixed in. Light bodied (a bit watery, actually) and slightly sweet. So so.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Now this was more like it! I liked this a lot better than the badger. Pours a pleasent shiny copper body with a large frothy head. a oaky taste, with a hint of red peppers and sausage. No lie! a good packer game day brew.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Had this one on cask at the brewpub in Madison, Wisconsin. Golden yellow pour, foamy, with piney hoppiness and sweetness of a candied apple, milky mouthfeel, with pineapple tartness and grapefruit. Interesting, but oddly mild.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;JT Whitneys has nice micro brew pub with nice view of the brewing area and reastaurant and bar. The brew is affordable and have a nice variety of brew types but the brew is mediocre or less for a micro brewering reatuarant, with the exception of very good barley wine, smoked porter, old ale, and gran cru. The food is a bit pricey but good. If this place good up the quality of the brew it could be a red hot destination-- if places like Flossmoor Station can have very good beer than JT Whitney should be able to too.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Growler from the brewpub. Poured a transparent copper with a nice tihick off white head, nice lacing. Aroma of burnt brown sugar. Flavor of thick and bitter hops with a little bit of apricot on the middle of the tongue. Aftertaste was medium bitter and full of hops. An ok beer for an amber ale.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;[GABF, Denver Co - 2006] Amber ale that poured very deep and rich and was an excellent Amber ale to drink. A �Packer� Seasonal Ale I liked the name and the beer was one of my favs of the day.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Translucent and opulent copper in color with an icy white pond rung fading into the center. Wet cardboard calls out the nose with caramel, citric brown bread, soggy graham crackers, mild amaretto and strawberry puffs. Nutty cocoa powder airiness settles in for flavor with a campfire cardboard trait to it. Super clean filtration distracts the flavors, making some aspects out to resemble infant fabric softener. That�s the bad part. The balance and flavor of earthy, dry cocoa mud is the simplistic yet enjoyable part. Nutty, medium-fired cigar wrappers crumble in the finish, and the aftertaste resembles that �morning after smoking a cigar� mouth flavor.
J.T. Whitneys Frozen Tundra Championship Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Cloudy, headless, cold. Orangish. No aroma to speak of, a bit of citrus and some bitterness. Pass me a Miller.

Bojort�l;Herrljunga, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Herrljunga Cider (Gamlestadens Bryggeri);"Yellow/golden colour, O.K. head. Bitter almond and concrete dust (!) aroma. The taste is the same as the aroma. Taste of bitter almonds stays on the tongue for hours! Thin palate. Something has gone terrible wrong with this beer. There's no ""best before"" anywhere on the bottle or the label so I can't tell if it was past its date."

Mallaskosken Tumma Kuohu IV;Sein�joki, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Mallaskosken panimo;Bottle (from the november 2005 RB-tasting at Dixens place - notes have been damaged by flooding of my basement, but this was such an insane tasting for me as I was new to such massive tastings, so I gave up on the detailed notes quite early). Slightly burned caramel in aroma and flavour. All that was readable...
Mallaskosken Tumma Kuohu IV;Sein�joki, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Mallaskosken panimo;Can 33 cl, Alko Arkadia, Helsinki. Pours clear deep copper red with a rich creamy head leaving lacing.

Not sure what kind of mood it was exactly, but here it goes. Aroma of cereal notes, slightly nutty and some fairly strong caramel-like sweetness going on. The color is dark brown with a scant off-white head. Flavor is metal and sweet caramel malts, with a touch of dark fruits. Decent beer.

Mary Ann Pale Ale;St Saviour, Jersey;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Liberation Brewery;330ml bottle. From Shropshire - vintage unknown - possibly late 1970s. Cap is decent condition, some scuffing on bottle and label. Chilled and served carefully, but beer is murky brown and unpleasant looking. Aroma is aged ale - dried fruit cake, old damp mattress, cardboard, straw, decaying wood, a touch of rotting flesh, a scratch of chocolate... Mouthfeel is firm, slightly chalky, with good flavours hovering around bitter chocolate. Finish is softly but firmly bitter and cardboardy with more chocolate. I was pleased to find this bottle, and I have enjoyed drinking it, though - regardless of the interesting flavours - this is not a great beer!

Smells actually very strongly of traditional amontillado sherry and little else. Not actually too bad. The flavor is just nothing but dirty water at this point and is not really worth drinking.

E & O IPA;San Francisco, San Jose, California, United States;IPA;E & O Trading Company;I had this a while back when they still made beer. I enjoyed it. It was a very light IPA but it had good hop aroma and flavor.
E & O IPA;San Francisco, San Jose, California, United States;IPA;E & O Trading Company;Draft. The best thing I can say about this beer was that it looked good. A deep golden color with a good thick head. Now on to the bad bits: it was over-carbonated and had this flavor that was grassy and industrial (if you can think of industrial slime as a flavor). This is the second time I've bought a pint of this and neither time have I been impressed, so I don't think it was just a bad batch.
E & O IPA;San Francisco, San Jose, California, United States;IPA;E & O Trading Company;Tap. Golden color with a laced white head. Hop aroma. Smooth crisp flavor. Bitter with a malty finish.
E & O IPA;San Francisco, San Jose, California, United States;IPA;E & O Trading Company;Deep golden color and appropriately headless. The drink is dry and clean, with big bushy fresh hop aromas and flavors. A bit of fruit from the malt is the mote on this otherwise very good brew.

Brasserie de la C�te l'Ambr�e 7%;Vullierens, Switzerland;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de la C�te;2003 bottle. Medium peachy-orange. Mostly clouded. Bottle conditioned. I simply could not get any head to pour. It looked like a geyser of fine bubbles erupting everywhere on the surface of the beer. HIGHLY CARBONATED. Smells of warm fuzzy peach cobbler, lightly phenolic. Some lightly sweet caramel malts and a touch of belgian yeast. Opens up with a mildly sour, fuzzy yeast flavor and mouthfeel. Candied sugar or caramel malt flavor quickly making its presence known. Quick transition to the finish due to the high amount of carbonation. Finish is mildly sweet, lightly fruity (peaches, sweet pears, apricots, hint of oranges), and quite yeasty. The longer I let this sit and breath, the better it tasted. Consistency is too watery to hold up to any real aging. Strange, muddled flavor of yeast, and light, papery hops along with an alcoholic sharpness never quite went away. Thanks to Philippe (Bov) for sendin this!

Mac and Jack's Serengeti Wheat;Redmond, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Mac and Jack's Brewing Company;Im a bit suspicious of this one because it was noticeably hoppy and of the same hop profile as the african amber and poured from the same tap that usually pour the amber ale.

Rochester Mills Raymonds Belgian Abbey Brown Ale;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Rochester Mills Beer Company;"This stuff is quite good. The ""Mills"" usually makes some rather sterile stuff, but I really liked this beer. I suppose that it does not have the thickness of Leffe or an Ommegag, but it also does not cost an arm and a leg on draft. Good sweetness and nice dark red, brown color. Nice job!"
Rochester Mills Raymonds Belgian Abbey Brown Ale;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Rochester Mills Beer Company;I had a hell of a night at Rochester Mills and, as I sit here holding my head, I can at least weakly smile at the crushed napkin on which i took notes about this beer. WOW, it says, and that's it - but I do remember the powerful spicy blast of this beer, warm and yeasty with a very present edge of alcohol and a whiff of cloves. It did me in.
Osje�ko Pivo;Osijek, Croatia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Osje�ka Pivovara;An average, neutral beer. Light golden color, with durable foam. Highly carbonated. Smell is neutral. Contains maize grits. It has a stronger affect to it's taste. Rather than malt... But nothing interesting character.

Esseker Pivo;Osijek, Croatia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Osje�ka Pivovara;08/12 0.33 l green bottle at Scout Irish Pub in Samobor. Poured pale yellow body with tiny head dissapearing immediately as there is almost no carbonation. Very weak aroma, some malts, almost non existent. Flavor is terrible, soapy with vegetables, after a while becomes flat luckily so I was able to finish 2/3 of the bottle. I am aware that this was probably spoilt, although BB date is fine, so I will re-rate, but this is as it is now.
Esseker Pivo;Osijek, Croatia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetl�;Osje�ka Pivovara;0.33l bottle at the Scout Pub in Samobor. Pivovara Osijek removed this from their site again. I really hope they haven�t retired it again already. Anyway, it poured a golden colour with a medium to big sized thick white head that went away slowly. Quite nice. The nose is nicely hoppy and malty, a touch herbal but with a touch of vegetables to ruin it a bit. The taste is dominated by a lovely fruity-peachy note that unfortunately mixes with cardboard near the end. The mild herbal hops stick to the background. Light but pleasant enough, very good for this brewery.

Karlova�ko Zimsko Pivo;Karlovac, Croatia;Pilsener - Imperial;Heineken Hrvatska;"After reading these reviews I didn�t expect much. Karlovacka Pivovara does beers that are ok, very drinkable, but not really special. This beer is no exception, bitter, but not over the top, nice toffeish aroma, but not much body. Truly beautiful brown/amber colour.... Anyway, I was once forced to leave an opened bottle for an hour, with the bent cap as only ""protection"". It retained the carbonation, but lost all its taste (!), and the bitterness was far more pronounced. I don�t think it�s a ESL, but I also don�t know what it is.... it�s like nothing I�ve seen before."

Duysters Loterbol 6 Blond;Diest, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);"Vintage bottle at Kulminator, where it was sold as a dry-hopped version with Orval yeast, which is a separate entry here; however, since the label mentions an ABV of 6.8% and there is no mention at all of Orval yeast being used, I cannot but assume it is the Loterbol 6 version, so I have no other choice than to put my rating under this entry. Very thick, coarse, �papery�, snow white, rocky and stable head over a lightly hazy golden blonde beer, more cloudy with deposit as expected. Aroma of straw, white bread, soapy wheat, field flowers, dried banana, lemon blossom, wet leather and damp hay. Crisp fruity onset, dried apricot and redcurrant, dryish with medium carbonation, bready pale malt sweetishness in the middle but still remaining on the dry side, floral and grassy, aromatic �noble� hop bitterness in the finish with lingering malt �juiciness�. I get a slight hint of onsetting �Brettification� so it may still be that other limited version, but I have no means to be one hundred percent sure - quite frustrating, actually, Duysters should have indicated the difference more clearly!"

Duysters Loterbol 6 Blond;Diest, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);Abused green 75cl bottle. Fading on the label told me this should be light -struck but I gave it a go. I suspect it was 2-3 years old. Poured a cloudy golden colour with a fair white head. Aroma of alcohol, caramel, treacle and yeast. Similar flavours with alcohol, black pepper, caramel, treacle and a lingering alcohol hum. Moderate carbonation. Quite smooth with a chewy mouth-feel. This stood up remarkably well given the storage conditions.
Duysters Loterbol 6 Blond;Diest, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);Perhaps I had a bad bottle of Loterbol or something, but this was mightily disappointing. Diacetyl-buttery, sweet and cloyingly syrupy, close to no head at all, and metallic on the nose. Quite possibly the worst Belgian I have ever tried -- and as I have tried in excess of 200, that�s saying quite a lot.

Dissipates at a nice pace. Sly messy lace. The aroma starts off with a thick sweet milk chocolate and a huge amount of sweet vanilla. Light roasty tones. The flavor leans to the sweet side. Sly roasty coffee to milk chocolate aftertaste with finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with an exceptionally smooth feel about it. Low carbonation. Overall, pretty good porter that I could have again, definitely a dessert porter if anything.

Three Needs Chocolate Thunder Porter;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Bomber - Poured a very dark brown in color with a foamy medium light tan head. Aroma is of roasted malts and a hint of chocolate... slightly sour too. ""Sparkly"" carbonation... almost too much for this style beer. Flavor is a mix of roasted malts, a small amount of chocolate and a bit of hoppy bitterness. Finish is slightly bitter. Too thin. OK, but not that distinctive."
Three Needs Chocolate Thunder Porter;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;By far their best beer in the lineup this night. It has even been bottled. Dark with some mocha head. Chocolate in aroma and tasted on the tongue. Detracting is the lower than medium mouthfeel, and active carbonation. Its one-trick pony with the chocolate stirred around.
Three Needs Chocolate Thunder Porter;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours a jet black color with a medium light brown head. Good aroma of chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor has no surprises, chocolate and roasted malt, a bitter finish, if not original this is a good, competent porter. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and gentle carbonation.
Three Needs Chocolate Thunder Porter;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Porter;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Thanks to Joshua and Buck in Ithaca! At first presented an almost bourbon or chocolate liqueur nose. Deep almost opaque black, brown color. Small off white head. Nose developed into a more hoppy mellow chocolate syrup scene. Milk chocolate effervenscence and flavor. finishes with dry chocolate bitterness. Decent brew.
Three Needs Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy semi-clear brown color with a cap of a white head that just slides out into oblivion. No lace. The aroma had some tangy nuts, weird blend, but alright, makes me wonder, still light honey and then burnt malts. The flavor leads with the tanginess. Then the nuts, and malts staying quite separate. Tangy aftertaste. Sharp almost acidic finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body. Hard to take down for a session because of the acidity in this. ABV seems alright to what is said. Carbonation feels fine as well. Overall, weird brown ale. What�s with the tanginess? Well, thanks for the beer tick, don�t see myself coming back to this.
Three Needs Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Light chalky bitter tang to the nose - wet canvas. Almost no sweet malt character though some mild chocolate. Dark brown-red clear with thin light tan head. Mild watery body with mild carbonation. Starts with mild sweet chocolate coffee notes. Mild tang, carbonic almost, with roasted malt finish. Very little bitterness anywhere, and pretty watery overall. Mild nutty after. It just doesn�t come together.
Three Needs Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Fruity esters and subtle dark malts in the aroma. Dark brown though not opaque with some amber highlights. Shy, off-white, fully-diminishing head. Caramel malts and earthy hops with dark malts creeping in to the finish. Medium body with low carbonation and watery texture. If this was intended to be an American brown ale, I�d expect more hop character, if British, I�d expect it to be more round and malty. On tap at the brewpub with MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.
Three Needs Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Oily, nutty roastiness dominates the thin and slick body...Quite fruity (prunes, raisins) and sweet, but ultimately watery...Another okay effort which disappoints by its weak feel and overall blandness...
Three Needs Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Diminishing head covers a chestnut body. Vanilla nose, quite nutty. Clean and light taste, getting surprisingly bitter toward the finish, but overall feeling wet above anything else.
Three Needs Brown Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;On tap at the brewpub. Having just been knocked out by the Chocolate Thunder Porter, my expectations for this were higher than they otherwise would have beeen. Sadly, hope was dashed as soon as I saw the pint: this thin-looking, reddish, no-head substance is a Brown Ale? This too-hoppy, thin-bodied, only-slightly-malty-when-warm concoction belongs to the same family as Sam Smith's Nutbrown Ale? Hazelnuts? Caramel malt? Rich, creamy texture? Not here folks. Now, back to that Porter...
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Bottled (backlog). Goldeny amber colour with a mediumsized foamy head. Aroma is grass, some earth, toffee and mild herbal and wooden notes. Flavour is earth, grass, toffee and some mild herbal notes. A bit floral and bitter tones to it as well as some slight metallic notes too.
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Tried as Henley Ale in a 500ml bottle that pours a pale golden amber color with a finger and a half of white head that leaves some thin soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma is grassy and earthy with some caramel. Taste is a pronounced hop bitterness with an underlying balance of caramel malty sweetness. A typical brew for the style with no real notable qualities. Decent, but nothing really stands out.
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Bottled, 500ml from a neighbour. Brown amber with white head. An ancient bottle gratefully accepted and it wasn�t too bad. There is a sweet malty toffee, caramel flavour with some hints of fruit. The bitterness and �Brakspear� taste had been absorbed but overall quite reasonable.
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Can.Lively on opening.A clinging sweetness dominates and there is really no other flavour. considerits from a can its not reallt that bad but certainly not one to search out.
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Can. Not a world class beer, but a nice break from the pale Spanish lagers. It�s a clear, deep golden beer with a dense, off-white head leaving nice lacings. Bread, caramel, roasted notes and hints of butterscotch and some metal in the aroma. The flavor has breadcrusts, caramel, notes of metal and butterscotch. Medium, creamy mouthfeel. It�s quite pleasant, but a bit too metallic. (070210)
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Can, from Waitrose. Copper, good lasting off white head and gentle condition. Good mix of peppery resinous hop oil and sweet caramel in the aroma, still quite oily and hoppy in the mouth but wih a caramel sweetness that becomes a little too cloying with time, thankfully the hops come back to dominate the finish with a resinous bitterness muting any remaining caramel notes.
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Can from Waitrose. Fairly straight up canned strong bitter. Nice malty aroma. Flavour is malty, strongly flavoured, slightly alcoholic. Untidy fruity esters. Acceptable is all - 2 cans left.
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Strong sherry and marzipan oxidised aroma but curiously appealing. Hazy amber-copper with lasting (!) off-white head that laces. Sweet, sherry-like flavours. Soft texture with low carbonation. Still very drinkable despite obvious signs of age and a bargain at 50p. Bottle (1979 vintage) sampled at GBBF 2005.
Brakspear Strong Ale (Bottle);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Brakspear (Marston's);Bottle (Henley Strong Ale) GBBF: Vintage 79, cheers Steve!! Cara malts in aroma, along with some oxidised cardboard notes. Ruby with a white head. Oxidised flavour, but still quite drinkable. Suprising!

Light brown head. This is a funny beer. Has aged quite beautifully. Is very sherry like in the nose. Flavour is more like a good madeira. Is light dusty and pruny, but nothing that spoils in general good experience. Thanks Steve.

Duvel Groen;Breendonk-Puurs, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Duvel Moortgat;Mooi goud geel van kleur met een witte schuimkraag.

Millys Tavern Manch-Vegas IPA;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Draught @ Brewery: This one pours a clear, coppery amber color. Some off white head and lacing. Resinous pine and citrus hops to the nose. The taste is good. Bitter, resinous pine and faint grapefruit. Some graininess. A nice IPA.
Millys Tavern Manch-Vegas IPA;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Comes in a medium copper color. Flavor is on the malty side at first but this one has lots of earthy-citrus bitterness on the back side. Very fresh tasting. Still can�t beat Cascades for a reliable hop profile.
Millys Tavern Manch-Vegas IPA;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Can from Brewtopia. Copper clear with small head. Caramel nuts peachy and citrus amber nuts grapefruit woody resin. Medium light. Definitely a throwback to 1995. Would have kicked ass then. Now, meh.

Millys Tavern Manch-Vegas IPA;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;"Keg pour at Powder Keg Beer & Chili Festival. Aroma is grassy, hay--all hops. Appearance is golden brown without sparkle, poor head retention and mild lacing. Taste is medium bitter. Palate is average carbonation with a little bit of a zing. Overall, there�s no complexity here, this is as advertised--""hoppy from start to finish."" Since I�m not a huge fan of this (perhaps I�ve learned that I don�t really like Cascade hops), this beer wasn�t for me. But, if you like this sort of thing, you�re going to love this beer."
Millys Tavern Manch-Vegas IPA;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Pint at tavern. Came with little head, ok lacing. Aroma of mild citrus, taste is strong hop flavor of citrus, giving way to piney flavors that end in a grapefruit bitterness. Some very slight caramel malt flavors are in the background. Fin is is clean and crisp.
Millys Tavern Manch-Vegas IPA;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;IPA;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Tap at Milly�s in Manchester, NH. Decent enough IPA, but falls a bit short on character. Hops are a bit muted. Mild citrus hop and mild malt.

Nice amber with plenty of retention, leaves sheets of lace down the pint. Nose is caramel covered hops. Flavors of pine hops, caramel malt and a slightly lingering bitterness. The bitterness does stack up and get stronger as it warms. It was a great way to cap of my meal and brewer. Peter can sure brew some beers.
Fant�me Black Ghost;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie Fant�me;Bottle - pours dark brown white head - nose and taste of tootsie roll, dark sugar and earthy fruit - medium body
Fant�me Black Ghost;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie Fant�me;750ml bottle pours dark, dark brown with a reddish tinge. Aroma carries a funky barnyard nose of black pepper, cherry, raisens, molasses, maybe fruitcake. Flavor is typical Fantome funkiness, woody, barnyard hay, yeasty spice, some dark syrupy sweetness. Peppery finish with vanilla and caramel notes lingering. Another fantastic beer from Fantome. My only quandary is why is this labeled as a Belgian stout, because I could taste no evidence of the sort.
Fant�me Black Ghost;Soy-Erez�e, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie Fant�me;Several years old bottle shared by a friend. Pours hazy amber to copper with a medium tan head. Malty and funky nose with slight dark fruit. Malty and caramelly flavor with some fruit before a funky finish.

Millys Tavern Millys Oatmeal Stout;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Pours a black colour with no visible highlights. The mocha-coloured head is nice, decent lasting, leaving patchy creamy lacing. The nose is full of dark fruits over the roasted malt base, so smelling this reminds me more of a porter. The taste has the same and hard to feel the oatmeal sweetness and smoothness. Maybe in the mouthfeel, some silkiness. Hints of smokiness and caramel do come out in the aromas after a while. A very decent dark fruity beer.
Millys Tavern Millys Oatmeal Stout;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Smooth and creamy, nice roast notes. Fine but nothing worth going out of my way for.

Upstream Flagship India Pale Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Upstream Brewing Company;On tap at Upstream, pours a cloudy bright orange with a small white head.

Upstream Honey Raspberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;[Tap] Had in my notes as �Honey Raspberry Lager�. Light pink in color with a thin off white head. Sweet grains and mild honey in the aroma. Similar notes in the taste. Sweet honey and berry. A bit on the thin side. Soapy mouthfeel. Fizzy �wine cooler-like� carbonation. Not great, but I could see where they were going with this one.
Upstream Honey Raspberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;O Gold with raspberry flavor added. Not a good combination in my mind. Sorry guys.
Upstream Honey Raspberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;Draft at Upstream. Hazy pink-orange. Rather insipid, but clean and drinkable too. Light bodied, straightforward. Artificial raspberry aroma, sweet.

Upstream Honey Raspberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;The body was dark gold to amber with an off white head. The aroma was strong with the raspberry and it was hard to smell anything else. The taste was dry raspberries with some light almonds. Overly cloying, I don�t know how anyone could take a pint of this stuff.

Poured clear amber color with an average fizzy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate raspberry aroma. Medium body and soft carbonation. Medium raspberry sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Average fruit beer.
Upstream Honey Raspberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a pale, cloudy, pink grapefruit juice color with a thin whitish head. The nose is a mellow raspberry that leans towards the sweet versus tart/sour side of the flavor/aroma spectrum, and it is devoid of the soapy extract note I�ve gotten from many other brewpub raspberry brews. Light bodied and thin with super-soft (almost flat) carbonation and zero finish. This is a super clean and quaffable fruit beer. The flavor follows the nose with not much more going on. I detect no honey whatsoever, but what this brew lacks in flavor and/or complexity it makes up for in drinkability; not a bad raspberry brew."
Upstream Honey Raspberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;Tap @ brewpub: Cloudy pink lemonade color with a white head and sticky lacing. Light raspberry aroma with a little tang. It�s ok for a fruit beer and not too sweet like some.
Upstream Honey Raspberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;on tap downtown. Looks like a zinfindel with a head. Sweet raspberry aroma, but not sickeningly so. Extract brewed, but not awful, as so many are. good, unexpected, hop and malt presence. best-tasting burps ever.
Upstream Honey Raspberry Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Upstream Brewing Company;"On tap, Legacy brew pub. Raspberry syrup smell reminiscent of a lesser framboise lambic; some malty bread in the aroma too. White fizzy head with ok lacing, orange amber in the glass. Raspberry syrup flavor is nice intensity, leavened wth some wheat malt; the Munich malt and corn flavors are strong in the finish, and I didn�t like them. I didn�t notice any honey in the flavor, but it�s a nice level of sweetness. I was expecting a weaker beer, but this turned out to be quite flavorful. The flavor, however, always seemed synthetic and candied. Not bad, but definitely not good."
Upstream Dundee 90 Shilling Scotch Ale;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Upstream Brewing Company;On tap at Upstream, pours a deep dark amber with a small off-white head. Aroma is very malty, with lots of caramel and dark dried fruits. Flavour is along the same lines, with caramel, bready malt and dried dark fruits. Nice and malty, with loads of caramel on the finish.

Pours mid amber with good clarity and a tiny white filmy head. There is a sweet tasting beer here but one with bitterness and dryness also very much present towards the end.

Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;On tap at Gray�s Tied House. Amber with a medium off-white head. Aroma of toasted malt, light citrus and some caramel malt. Taste is pretty non-descript and felt much more like an APA than an IPA as it was lightly hopped and the bitterness was faint. Some floral notes to go with pale malt and light citrus.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub, pours hazy with a decent head. No nose, taste is at first toasty, with some earthy hops and a bitter finish. Nothing too special, but good beer.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;Draft at the Tied House. Medium amber orange, thick tan head, good lacing. Orange citrus aroma with some malt syrup sweetness. Flavor similar, citric hops, sweet caramel malt, nothing complex but flavorful and very well harmonized. Medium to full body with a definite hops bite. A beer with a simple profile, that does that simple profile very well.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;Draft at the Tied House. Hazy orange-tan color. Solid bitterness, with a touch more depth than other Gray�s beers I sampled. Solid grapefruit citrus flavor on top of a basic sweet malt backbone. A touch more bitterness and dryness than a typical US version.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;As the description says, dead on. I really enjoy this one, and hope they make it one of their regular taps at the Tied House.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;On draught at the Tied House in Verona, Wisconsin. Pours a clear amber brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that dissipates nearly clean. Aroma of caramel malt, some citrus zest, a touch of pine and dry earth herbs. Taste is medium bodied, some carbonation with flavors of mild caramel malt, a touch of citrus zest and lemon. Finish is semi-dry with a hint of citrus and some light bread malt. This beer is more close to an American Pale Ale than an IPA.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;More of a summer time refresher then a champion IPA. Worked well with spicy BBQ. I was most dissapointed with the aroma it just was bland. If you want to get the most complexaty out of this beer I would let it get closer to room temp.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;Bottle. Copper pour with resiny hoppy, malty, and tropical fruity citric aroma. Medium palate, with some hops an caramel bready malt notes, and a piney, tangeriney finish.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;(12oz bottle, thanks Barry) Small beige head topping a lightly hazed amber body. Aroma is moderately sweet, caramel, floral, light pine, orange. Taste is medium sweet, pine, caramel, some grapefruit, lemon. Light-medium body with light resin. No one will mistake this for a West Coast IPA -- while I agree with others that this seems more an APA than an IPA, the bitterness does pick up a notch once the beer warms.
Grays IPA;Janesville, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grays Brewing Company;12 oz bottle purchased at the Woodmans in Beloit WI. Served between cellar & fridge temps from a 12 oz Michelob glass, Michelob baby! Pours a light clear copper, moderate fizzy off-white head, quick-dissipating, with a touch of fine lacing...mildy piney hoppy nose, touch of lemon, some wood, and some dry biscuity malt...body moderately sweet, quite malty, full, with hops moderate to strong only at midpalate one...barely present at the front, and not really all that bitter at the finish, though a nice dusty dry acidity does settle in late...very quaffable, nothing spectacular and closer I think to an APA, it�s a solid middle-of-the-road effort.
Fordham & Dominion Virginia Native Dark;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Dark caramel color with minimal off-white head. Aroma is caramel sweet. Taste is well-rounded caramel, medium sweet. A bit floral hoppy on back of tongue with an OK bitter finish. Decent body, but it'd never be mistaken for a doppelbock.
Fordham & Dominion Virginia Native Dark;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;First impression is it's quite light-colored for a dark brew, more pale auburn than dark. Firm, lasting head. Nose is a bit nutty, not hugely prevalent. Flavor is somewhat sweet and malty, but not particularly full. Finish is slightly oily and thin.
Fordham & Dominion Virginia Native Dark;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"Here is an outstanding draught only bock bier you won't find too many places outside of the DC Metro Area. This beer is brewed by the Virginia Native Brewing Company of Arlington, VA which is attached to a popular night club called The Birchmere. Virginia Native has been owned by the Fordham Brewing Company of Annapolis, MD for just over a year now. Virginia Native Dark pours to a beautiful, bright, tawny brown color with a creamy tan head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose is full of deep malty aromas of toast, nuts, and sweet malt, achieved through decoction. This is paired with light whisps of peppery alcohol. The palate is firm with good dark malt flavors, sweet malt, those signature ""toasty"" and ""nutty"" flavors of a stylistically accurate bock bier. Virginia Native Dark finishes with more fantatic deep malty flavors up front, then ends with just enough grassy hop bitterness to balance this beer out to perfection. This is an exceptional domestic version of bock bier. Malty, clean, slightly warming, enjoy this one on draught, year round at the Birchmere, and good beer bars in the DC Metro Area."
Sunnybrook Winter Warmer;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - English;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);A good, strong winter warmer. The alcohol presence is subdued, but definitely present. Very malty, even maltier than the fest, with hints of nutmeg, cinnamon, candy sugar, and cognac. The finish is warm and smooth. A great winter warmer from Bill Moore.

Red Bell Black Cherry Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Draft at the Wachovia Center. Dark brown color with hardly any head.

Wish i could have it in a glass instaed of the plastic cup.
Red Bell Black Cherry Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Excellent cherry flavor.

Red Bell Black Cherry Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;I drank it on tap at the Wachovia center. Strong cherry aroma, not much head. Probably would have been better in a glass and if I was seated. The cherries dominated over any chocolate or coffee flavors. The hop finish seemed overwhelmed by a sourness of the cherries. Went nice with the beef sandwich I ate with it.
Red Bell Black Cherry Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Dark stout that never produces much of a head.

Red Bell Black Cherry Stout;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Red Bell Brewery & Pub;Had this at the First Union Center in Philly. Small head which does not last real long. Excellent rich, dark red/brown in color. Not much light getting through. Aroma of coffee and black cherries. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with tastes of coffee and black cherries again and maybe a slight smokey flavor. Finish is stong with slight alcohol overtones and coffee. A very decent brew and one that I look forward to having each time I am in Philly for a Flyers game. Would highly recommend for a someone looking for a change of pace in their stout.

Tring Side Pocket for a Toad (Cask);Tring, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tring Brewery;"Just opened a fresh (""bright"") 3-litre bottle purchased at the brewery. Quite good, a little sweet, not much of a head on it, excellent colour, very good aroma (lingering hop notes). From the brewery's own information, it uses American Cascade hops, which is a little different from the fuggles-based English mild ales I usually prefer. However, if you treat it as a sweetish bitter, it cannot be surpassed. This is my first taste of this product and, from experience, microbrewery ales are not always consistent (although they should be, as consistency is assured from using the same yeast every time). However, this is really good. The aftertaste is a little bread-ish, which is pretty much the best aftertaste, and I think I'm going to be a repeat customer."

Becketts Old Town Bitter;Basingstoke, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Becketts Brewery;Quite pale colour. Intensely dry and bitter. May be a bit austere for some but an excellent session bitter in my book. Other Becketts beers have exhibited the same uncompromising bitterness. Could omhper have got a wrongly labelled beer as our comments don't match up at all? Handpump, The Speaker, Westminster, London SW1, March 2003.
Becketts Old Town Bitter;Basingstoke, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Becketts Brewery;Deep golden in colour. Sweet and medium bodied. The flavour is somewhat offputting buttery, and I'm afraid there's not much else tastewise here. Low bitterness. This does not count as one of my favourite cak ales ever.

Uitzet Kriekbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;Geproefd tijdens de 24 uur van het belgische bier in Antwerpen in 2002 waar ik net mijn notities van teruggevonden heb. Ik heb toen genoteerd: aan de geur en de kleur lijkt het als een doordeweeks kriekbier, maar de iets zurige toets geeft het iets speciaals, ik vind het goed
Uitzet Kriekbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;Bottle 75cl @ Cnudde Tasting.. Unclear orange red color with a large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head.

Uitzet Kriekbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;The Fonefan/Brugmansia Cnudde tasting. It�s a nice dark red beer, a bit like homemade strawberry juice, and the head is nice. The aroma has notes of yeast, barnyard and fruit. The flavour has notes of yeast, light barnyard, berries and light sweetness. It�s refreshing, but the sourness is a bit sharp.

Uitzet Kriekbier;Wetteren, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Paeleman;"No date is notched on the Best Before label, but the latest it goes is 2000, so I�ve got to imagine this to be at most a 2000, with the possibility (and probability) that it is actually more like a 97-99. Anyways, 750mL bottle consumed by myself on 8/17/2005. Smells of band-aids, bretty and dry, with a light medicinal funkiness. Cherry-raspberry jam flavor on the end. Big ruddy-raspberry flecked beige colored head that quickly fizzles down, but remains about one-finger high. Intensely tiny bubbles and a very hazy/opaque deep strawberry color. Aroma out of the glass is powerful and very interesting. Tart, funky, wooly-dusty aroma. Much similarity to a kriek lambic. Flavor is rubber, plastic, tart, tart yeast and a dry sourness on the end. Lemon-rind and medicine and black pepper. Good lord this is tart! Extremely dusty and medicinal. Very dry and seems quite attenuated, though I know this stuff is very old, so that explains that. Really well-made, though. Not watery, or overly yeasty. Probably the most incredible part of this was what happened upon adding the yeast shot to my glass. Bigger, sweeter flavors now with a wonderful, chewy yeast and cherry-pie flavor. It does quite the opposite of dulling the flavor. REALLY good at the bottom of the bottle. Alcohol becomes somewhat noticeable. Soft and fuzzy cherries, alcohol undertones, some bits of honey or maybe just cherry sweetness. With the yeast shot, this beer is second to none! Sweet, mellow, soft and juicy; just perfect really. I�d be crazy if I didn�t think this as good as most krieks (lambic or no lambic). Not quite on the level of Cantillon, perhaps not the mouthfeel and very well developed bacteria and sourness that I enjoy, but quite incredible in its own right. Thanks for the tip, David!"
Durango Wheat Beer;Durango, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Durango Brewing Company;New brewer, owner & cans! Pours a hazy golden color with a big white fluffy head that lingers leaving massive curtains of lace on glass. Smells of grass, dough, flowers & a hint of citrus fruit. Tastes of bread, honey ? & a bit of spice. Light body, watery mouthfeel, a bit under carbonated, soft, mildly spicy finish. Well the beer is better than the previous owner/ brewer. It�s crisp, clean & refreshing but boring! Decent wheat beer for a hot summer day!
Durango Wheat Beer;Durango, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Durango Brewing Company;Bottle bought in Durango. Wheat malt aroma and not much else. Pours golden colored with one finger of white head that has good retention and lacing. Starts with wheat malt flavors and finishes the same with a bit of a watery body. Pretty one sided but still a refreshing beer for a hot Colorado day.
Durango Wheat Beer;Durango, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Durango Brewing Company;Trade extra. Cloudy yellow with persistent head. Light nose of wheat, light flavors of wheat. Inoffensive and far better than the rating of 11 but about as nondeScript and boring a beer as could be.

Brasserie Artisanale de Fribourg Framboise;Fribourg, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fri-Mousse;Bottled. Orange coloured. Unclear. Beige dense head. Sour, earthy aroma full of raspberries. Delicious.

Brasserie Artisanale de Fribourg Framboise;Fribourg, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fri-Mousse;Pinkish colour and very opaque, like grapefruit juice, if grapefruit juice had a huge frothing head on it. Smells a bit like grapefruit, then comes raspberries, vanilla and nuts. Soft, sweetish, delicate and rounded fruit flavour. Quickish finish, but this is the hugely refreshing raspberry beer that hundreds of brewers should be doing, instead of just mailing it in by adding syrup to their regular wheat or golden ale.
Brasserie Artisanale de Fribourg Framboise;Fribourg, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fri-Mousse;Bottled, thanks Bov! Clody peach colour, rich head. Aroma of fresh raspberries. Dry, fresh and lightly acidic. The mouthfeel is light and pleasant. Interesting and fairly well balanced beer.
Brasserie Artisanale de Fribourg Framboise;Fribourg, Switzerland;Flavored - Fruit;Fri-Mousse;"Thin, off-white head, slowly disappearing; fully hazy (yeast in suspension) peach-coloured beer. Very perfumey, but not fruit; rather spciy: coriander maybe, rosewater, other aromatic spices; also a whiff of wet cardboard. Taste is more fruity; sweet (red) gooseberry, bit citrus fruit but not aggressively sour, some exotic fruit - but no raspberry... finish is a bit grainy, pale malts. Very slightly acidic. Light mouthfeel without being thin. Acidity makes it refreshing. Several brewers have told me that raspberries pose a problem, losing both colour and flavour fast. But aroma... They will have to learn yet in Switzerland, one needs a LOT of fruit - or something else. I�m sure they will get there."

Harpoon Celtic Red;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Harpoon Brewery;Pours a bourbon-amber-golden with a short-lived beige head. Caramel and marshmallow on the nose. Toasted malt with a creamy fruit quality in the flavors.
Harpoon Celtic Red;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Harpoon Brewery;Harpoon has been hit or miss for me. This one was a miss. Not bad, just lacking flavor and aroma. Hop finish is about the best thing going here. This is light on the malt which leads to a weaker, less-bodied flavor. Mouthfeel is decent and a little above average.....the rest of the beer is forgettable. Glad I tried though so I know what not to get in the future if I'm at an airport/Harpoon Cafe, etc. and trying to decide on which style to get.
Harpoon Celtic Red;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Harpoon Brewery;Aroma is malts, slightly toasty. The flavor is malts, mild caramel, fruit and a smooth finish.
Harpoon Celtic Red;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Harpoon Brewery;Not the best Irish ale. Expected smoothness but its more watery than creamy. Sweetness is muted and the aftertaste is stale. Tried for the first time at the brewery in 2007.
Harpoon Celtic Red;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Harpoon Brewery;Kind of plain & boring without any true flaws. Has an attractive copper pour w/ a white head & pretty lacing.

Harpoon Celtic Red;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Harpoon Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 3-14-13- Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance �Served a mahogany colored brew with ruby like highlights and a small off white head. The head fades rather fast to leave a persistent film on the top of the brew. Smell � The aroma is heaviest of a sweet caramel smell mixed with notes of lightly roasted malt and a biscuit smell. Mixed with these are some aromas of a buttery toffee and a light grassy hop. Taste � The taste begins with a lightly roasted bready flavor as well as some caramel sweetness. As the taste advances further some toffee, biscuit, and some fruit flavors a apple and a light cherry come to the tongue. The flavors remain relatively constant throughout the rest of the taste until the end where a light citrus and herbal hop flavor come to the tongue. Mouthfeel �The body of the brew is on the medium side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average to just below average side. The medium body and carbonation suit the drinkable and lightly roasted and sweeter flavors of the brew quite well. Very appropriately done. Overall � A decent red ale. It has an easy drinking and non-complex flavor profile that has nice smoother flavors which makes a good beer to have while enjoying the company of other.
Bank Street Harvest Wheat;Stamford, Connecticut, United States;Mild Ale;Bank Street Brewing;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. Undated 2000?: This tastes light and hearty with some nice lemony flavor. It smells like a meadow in the fall. This definitely captures the season.
Bank Street Harvest Wheat;Stamford, Connecticut, United States;Mild Ale;Bank Street Brewing;Solid gold with a creamy off white nitro head. Nice aroma of sweet malts and sugar. Complex maltiness loaded with creamy sweetness (sugar added?) and a tangy hop bite. Lightly fruity as it warms. I think sitting around in the tanks for a while has increased the ABV in this brew because wisps of alcohol were tasted at times. Nice seasonal.

Decent enough mead.
Lurgashall English / Celtic / Christmas Mead;Lurgashall, West Sussex, England;Mead;Lurgashall Mead;A nice, smooth, simple and easy drinking mead. It has a lot of sweetness, but it�s not an overly rich or syrupy sweetness. Body is still thicker than wine, but it reminis bright and crisp. The spices are a good idea, but they leave a lot of sediment that takes away from the drinking experience. I should have used a little stocking for steeping.

Lucknow Winter Ale;Moultonborough, New Hampshire, United States;Strong Ale - English;Castle Springs Brewing Co. - Lucknow;"Lucknow, I hardly knew ye. Drier than most winter ales, and is truly a nice warm beer on a cold, snowy night. The head was lighter than most winter ales but looking at the ""Style"" might explain that.

Millys Tavern Mt. Uncanoonuc Golden Cream Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Cream Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Can, undated, drunk 5/14/16. Pours a clear, bronze-golden with a foamy white head atop showing average retention. Pepper, floral/sharper herb notes in the nose are softened by angel food cake-like maltiness and light yeast minerality. No alcohol and while I fought with myself as to whether I was finding any butter, it was only just a hint at most and was probably just the malt character. Hops aren�t terribly fragrant, but they�re fresh and I do like that it�s not pine and citrus. Soft, lightly malty texture with high carbonation, but not overly fizzy. Honey, white bread and black pepper with dried herbs (thyme, basil, oregano-like character) making for a pretty good balance overall. Clean and with no alcohol. Could be more dry and the malt flavor a little more polished (it�s just a touch mushy-sweet), but it�s still clean and that�s probably the most important part. Looking at the earlier (10 years old) ratings, it looks like they�ve come a long way and cleaned up their act, which is good.

Traquair 1000th Brew;Innerleithen, Peebleshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Traquair House;Bottle at Akkurat. It pours opaque dark brown, with a thin off-white head. The nose is chocolate, treacle, Scottish tablet, spice, Dundee fruit cake and a touch of alcohol. The taste is liquorice, black jacks (the sweet), treacle, roasted malt, filter coffee, wood, chewy malt, dark fruit (prune and date), brandy, nut and dark chocolate, with a dry, roasty finish. Medium-full body, with fine carbonation. Delicious, well balanced and hides the alcohol very well indeed. Just another reason why I think Traquair is a brilliant brewery.

Traquair 1000th Brew;Innerleithen, Peebleshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Traquair House;Special thanks to Gavin for bringing this along. Mahogany coloured with dark, fruity aromas. Taste is very complex with stewed dark fruits and burnt caramel. Could be better after a bit of cellaring.

Slightly sweet malty mouth, a touch of chocolate caramel goodness. Very heavy a very sweet. The hops subtly lingering in the finish. Definetly a bit oxidized.

Traquair 1000th Brew;Innerleithen, Peebleshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Traquair House;"Bottle at Akkurat, Stockholm, vintage 2000, 8 years old Cloudy brown color with red shades, with a thick creamy head. Very nice aroma, malt and caramel, quite mature, a bit woody. Good body strength, round mouthfeel, pleasant sweetness; powerful caramel flavor, with notes of mild chocolate and correct bitterness. More chocolate in the end. The alcohol warmth can be perceived, in the end. It reminds me some good Strong Ale from Belgium more than a Barley Wine from England (more chocolate than sticky malts), I like it mostly for it�s round body and medium sweetness; it�s very well brewed and still excellent."
Traquair 1000th Brew;Innerleithen, Peebleshire, Scotland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Traquair House;Near black colored, slight red hints. Little light brown head. Sweet, oaky, vinous, even port vinous tones in strong aroma with mild nuts. Near full bodied. Flavor is even more vinous with some licorice and sweet chocolate, aftertaste lats with sweet vinous touch and medium alcohol, some nuts also there. Too sweet for my taste.

Millys Tavern Tashas Red Tail Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;12oz can. Pours a clear light amber with a white head. Overly foamy head makes me suspect that this batch was contaminated. Second time this has happened with a MIllys brew so not sure what is going on with them. overly sweet along with soap and bread. Not great.
Millys Tavern Tashas Red Tail Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Can from Bert�s Brilliantly clear tawny brown with a decent sized long lasting beige head. Caramel and earth dominate the nose with a light toffee rounding it out. Light fruity flavor with bit toffee caramel and earthy flavor. Sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel moderate carbonation. Not a bad beer, but certainly reminds me of what everyone sold in the mid 90�s.
Millys Tavern Tashas Red Tail Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Sample on tap at the brewpub. Clear copper brown pour with thin white head. Aroma is malty, light caramel, light toasted notes. Taste is bitter, earthy hop flavors, caramel. Palate is med-light bodied with med carbonation. Ok.
Millys Tavern Tashas Red Tail Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Bottling date of 09/05/15. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking hazy dark amber color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a light minute. Semi-formal lacing represents around the glass. The smell starts off with a rich roasty nutty to caramel to toffee character with subtle sticky pomme-like fruity notes. Light toast as well shows a light balance. The taste was mainly malty sweet with the rich toasty effects running over the caramel, nuts, toffee and light fruits. A nice light sweet sticky caramel aftertaste runs into a wet sticky finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the caramel and toast to really pull the stickiness along my tongue. Overall, I say this was a pretty good Amber ale that I would have again.
Millys Tavern Tashas Red Tail Ale;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Tap at Milly�s in Manchester, NH. Amber pour with a smaller white head. Caramel malt and some floral elements in this one - pretty nice.

Beer Works Muddy River Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Beer Works;Nice aroma and look. Taste of a typical american porter but slightly lacking a full bodied taste.
Beer Works Muddy River Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Beer Works;Tap @Beer Works Canal Street Dark ruby color, good beige head. Coffeish, a bit woody aroma. Medium-bodied. Coffeish, vegetables lurking around, woody and slightly berryish flavor. Quite nice.

Beer Works Muddy River Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Beer Works;On tap in Hingham. This porter was really big in Smoke, almost over the edge. Fair head and nice lacing with dark fruits adding to a complex beer.
Beer Works Muddy River Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Beer Works;"Draft at Canal Street location. Served in a 16 oz. English pint glass. I guess the color does resemble mud color water. Low carbonation and nearly no head. Mild roast and slight chocolate, after it warmed a bit. Underwhelming nose. Caramel malt paired with light roast. With a slight hop to add balance. The flavor really didn�t get me excited. Something wasn�t right with the hop bitterness. I still finished it but having the Oatmeal Stout right before this; it really made this brew seem weak in every aspect. I will not order again."
Beer Works Muddy River Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Beer Works;On draft in Salem. Poured a deep brown black, awesome lacing all the way down. The aroma was chocolate and coffee, only some faint roast. The flavor followed, somewhat on the sweet side of things, chocolate and coffee in the fore, looking for more roast and / or smoke in the background. Mouthfeel was on the flatter side of moderate carbonation, but certainly not detracting. A decent porter, that I would have just called a stout.

Pour is an opaque brown ruby with a tan head that coats the glass nicely. Aroma is a nice gentle roastiness, along with a touch of pine hops. Clean. Taste is the nose, nice clean balance between the roast malt and pine hops. Simple, but nice and clean. Nice porter.
Quidi Vidi Winter Beer;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;341ml bottle. Had this one probably 10 years ago in a mixed pack I picked up at the NSLC. I hope to try the other Quidi Vidi products again in the future, but as this one is retired I might as well record it. I think it was dark and sweet, but didn�t really stand out as special. Average marks for the sake of posterity.
Quidi Vidi Winter Beer;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Copper colour with a thin and fully diminishing tan head. Decent caramel, nutty, and lightly roasty aroma. Mostly caramel flavour, with a touch of hazelnut and sherry creeping in that may have been the start of some oxidation. Clean finish. Light to medium bodied and lightly fizzy.
Quidi Vidi Winter Beer;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;I have to say that I was a little disappointed with this. nice dark color and good alcohol content, but taste is a bit too fizzy and sweet. As you swallow, you can actually feel the carbonation reacting in your throat. I don't think this is a good thing. Still, this isn't a bad beer and I would probably drink it again. There is just some room for improvement.
Quidi Vidi Winter Beer;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Nice copper colour with a goodly amount of carbonation. Sweet, malty nose. The taste is not amazing, but does have some complexity. Some bitterness, some maltiness. Kind of thin, but better than I expected.
Quidi Vidi Winter Beer;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;"Fairly light for a Winter Beer. Light amber in color; very light, fluffy head; a bit thin on the palate. Presents with a mildly assertive malt profile; somewhat yeasty or toasted bread. A pleasantly sweetish finish. Not bad overall, just a bit of a lightweight for a Newfoundland winter."
Quidi Vidi Winter Beer;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Not too shabby. Very skunky in aroma I found, but the beer did not taste skunky. Pretty bitter in a strange way.
Quidi Vidi Mummers Brew;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Deep red/copper colour with medium carbonation. A little fizzy. Nice little malty nose. Pretty good! Nice and crisp. Dry in the finish. I like it. Some fruity malt taste and it turns out to be quite a good beer.
Quidi Vidi Mummers Brew;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;"Nothing to call home about. None of these Quid Vidi beers have what beer lovers call a ""head"" or ""lacing"". Must be taboo in parts of Newfoundland."
Quidi Vidi Mummers Brew;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Quidi Vidi Brewing Company;Good beer, like Albert said not much head, or lacing, but still good beer!..
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);650ml bottle @ Matt�s. Pours a light amber colour. Nose of somewhat fruity but not really pleasant, something not quite right. Flavour is uh... lightly sour, light, but diacetyl overpowers. It gives me a semi no feeling.
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);Bottle - Radpberry and weird light malty notes. Clearish gold with a decent white head. Light soured raspberry and a clean finish.
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);Tasting at Matt�s Cloudy orange color. Smells like fruity ass. Dry mouthfeel, overly carbonated, tart light fruit. Very bad.
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);22 oz. bottle, pours a cloudy amber orange with a small white head. Aroma brings out faded raspberries, not much else. Flavour is very weak and uninspired, with very faded raspberry, some cleaner notes, and dusty wheat. What a pointless, weak, shitty beer. Uninspired and not very pleasant.
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);Pretty fizzy beer, not a lot of head, doesn�t last and has very little lacing. Aroma is a candy-ish raspberry, with a bit of metallicity. Taste is not great, kind of an astringent finish. Very weak taste, not a great finish. Now I have 5 more of these to go, yay...
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);head disappears quickly, even with a lot of carbonation. aromas of raspberry, cherries, and biscuits. taste of fresh raspberry with bready malts and bitter hops. a very very interesting tase.
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);"Bomber from Mullet2007! Thanks! My first NF beer and the first US rater of this! Nose is sweet raspberries, me being familiar with the aroma as we have been eating them here fresh for a month! The nose also has some faint caramel malt; hazy amber-orange with a medium off-white head; flavor has hop bitterness along with raspberry tartness, the two contrasting opposites making it an interesting and different beer than the Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat I drank yeasterday; finish has light raspberry sweetness."
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);bottle from Mullet2007. thanks! murky orange pour, nice off white head. Aroma is very much raspberries, but kinda artificial though. Some nice malt, and some yeastiness. Flavour is sweet, and and almost chewy. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste, but the raspberry lingers. A nice summer beer.
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);Very carbonated. Dark yellow. Holds a half inch head. Beer and raspberry aroma. Real berry bitterness. Chewy enough to mull on for a pint or two in the sun. Not a strong fruitiness but enough base beer.
Storm Brewing Raspberry Wheat;St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Storm Brewing (NF);Bottle in St. John�s. Pours golden-red with a white head. Aroma of raspberries, hops. Strong wheat flavour and definite real raspberries. Crisp, a bit too sweet, but a nice beer. Definitely would try it again.
Falls City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Falls City Classic Pilsner has a medium, creamy, off-white head, an odd, murky, gray-gold appearance, and some glass lacing. The aroma is strange- Belgian spicy yeast. The flavor is likewise strange, but bitterness is in play. Mouthfeel is medium, and Classic Pilsner finishes on the dry side. RJT
Falls City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"Many young folks in the Louisville/Falls Cities area learned to drink beer with ""Feel Silly."" The original version poured light and smooth w/ a big head, went down a little metallic, and finished like one had just drunk out of the Ohio River. But you wanted another one anyway. Made a man feel like a man! The new stuff tastes better, but the ambience just ain�t the same. Iron City, Falls City, great memories!"
Falls City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;12oz bottle (Old Notes-Brewed by Evansville Brewing Co.)-Pours a clear golden with a decent sized white head. Aroma of corn, grains, and slight hops. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew was rather tasty as I was expecting the worse.
Falls City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"7/20/2013: Falls City Original Pale Ale - This is definitely not your typically macro-style lager and should be at least tried by those who like that kind of beer. Why? Well, this is a really light English-style Pale Ale. I�d say that it has a similar appearance to the macro lagers and a similar carbonation level and mouthfeel, but it has some decent flavor with just a bit more hops showing through. Falls City describes this offering as ""full-bodied and well-balanced with a nice finish. It is less hoppy than typical American Pale Ales."" It�s definitely light since it�s meant to be a session beer and while the aroma doesn�t present much, the flavor is dry (almost like that oxidized cardboard flavor) biscuity/bready maltiness that works well with the mild herbal hops. I�d call this a light English Pale Ale, and it�s definitely clean and sessionable. It�s also a refreshing palate cleanser. Presented with this as an option, I wouldn�t hesistate to have a pint. Draught (sample) at Old Chicago in Lexington, KY. Rating #31 for this beer."
Falls City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;This canned brew poured a medium sized head of finely sized white colored foamy mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a carbonated transparent straw yellow colored body and a poor lacing. The aroma was mildly astringent with a malt hop base. The mouth feel was mediumly tingly from start to finish with a crisp thin flavor of mild malts and hops in the finish. The flavor was the same with a mild malt hop crisp clean note.
Falls City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"Mercifully discontinued. Anyone living in Louisville under the age of 80 referred to this beer as ""Falls Shitty"". Don�t confuse this with the new Falls City Pale Ale."

Falls City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Had this beer on 5/31/2000. Aroma is a sweet and somewhat sour malt scent. Carbonation is low as well as the head. Color is a pale gold with a ton of shit floating around that looks like some one put a pinch of chew in it. Taste is thin and watery light. Starting with light body it goes down with a sour odd taste. Finish is a sweet malt flavor that reminds me of a bad import. Overall this is one of the worst beers I have ever had.
Falls City Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;this is nast with a capital T. another winner from shag. the can is cool cuz it�s old school but that�s all the props this gets and it�s from the home state.
