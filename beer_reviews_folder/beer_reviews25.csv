Probably the last sighting of this beer as the brewery has closed. Nice bright gold colour                             ,with plenty of condition and a prickly mouthfeel. Less aroma than I expected,but there�s plenty of zesty citrus on the palate and a touch of sharp apple. Very dry and distinctly bitter. No great complexity but this is a good quencher,with lots of fresh       ,crisp bite.

A light straw gold coloured beer with some nice lemony citrus hops in the aroma. The taste is good strong hops again a lemon note dominates. A decent and very dry beer which will almost certainly be the last Cheriton beer I ever have.

On Tap! Hazy Daze Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;On Tap! Bistro & Brewery;Draft in brewpub. Having just returned from an early summer visit to Germany, I've had several good Hefeweizens recently so I feel well prepared for this rating. This brewpub seasonal has the classic hazy, yellow color but a small white head. The aroma is fruity, spicy and wheaty. Flavor a little sour, lemon, grains and tart hops. Palate is good, light to medium body with creaminess in the carbonation. Refreshing and crisp, but not my favorite rendering of the style.

Mighty Oak Burntwood Bitter;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask (Gallows Bird, Espoo, Real Ale Festival 2006) A great example of English style bitter. A wholly pleasing and almost warming beer. Nutty and woody taste, which definitely presses my buttons.

Archers Mid Summer Sun;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask, Theobald Arms, Grays, Essex. Honey coloured. A nice citric dance. Mouthfeel a little too firm and oily for a good Summer Ale. Nice balance between sweet and sharp - but a cleaner, crisper taste would be more appropriate. A pleasant drink.
Kraftbrau English Style Brown Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Kraftbrau Brewery;A little mild and watery, malt nice up front and a fairly snappy (well, appropriate for style) hop close - plain old brown malt, not that nutty, quite refreshing.
Mehana Roys Private Reserve;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;Crappy label! Light amber / orange colossal white mountain exists above my glass. It has very good retention and a tiny bit of sediment. The aroma is pretty typical but I was surprised because I had no idea that this was the style. Light spicy yeast, citrus (orange, something red and fleshy), banana bread - nice and soft. The taste has an initial light fruit hit with a malty finish and a light sourness hanging overhead. Mild and soft yeast, subtle spices, banana, maybe lemon - dunno, a bit too light but it�s easy to drink. Not quite medium bodied, drying with a slight tart finish.
Mehana Roys Private Reserve;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;(Bottle) Purchased from Kadota Bottleshop in Hilo for $11.99. Pours a deep amber body with a thin, white frothy heaad. Very mild aroma, perhaps bready. Flavour is mildly milky with some allspice. Very light and somewhat generic.

Mehana Roys Private Reserve;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;Gold with a white head. Caramel malt aromas. Some mild hop bitterness and toasted malt flavors. Easy to drink, light and dry. Decent, but probably tastes better if you�re in Hawaii.
Mehana Roys Private Reserve;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;12oz bottle from Liquor Collection. The first impression is the great caramel color and carbonation. The beer looks really good. This is a safe beer to say the least. It has beer flavor and a nice balance and that is not good enough. I do not see myself buying this beer again. But, it may go really well with sushi, and when I hit the lottery I will go to Roy�s and try it out.
Mehana Roys Private Reserve;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;12 oz bottle: Very little to say about this beer. Seemed almost like an extract beer, with a very boring malt profile that lent nothing to the beer. Poured a golden yellow with a smallish white head. The nose was neary impossible to discern, maybe a little fruitiness, but not much. Again, the body was very bland and safe. At the same time, it wasn�t necessarily offensive. I guess, as the description says, it has a clean taste. But then again, so does water.
Mehana Roys Private Reserve;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;Try as I mite I just cant pick up too much aromas. Very tight on the nose. I do get a hint of cinnamon and fresh bread dough. Appearance is very interesting with a rusted, oxidized, anodized gold plating look to it. Taste is again cinnamon, caramel, and cream. All some what faint though. Kind of light but definitely a smooth drinking beer. Definitely not a sipper.
Mehana Roys Private Reserve;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;12 oz bottle at Roy�s, Waikiki. Clear amber with a white head. Sweet caramel nose, biscuity and cookielike. Sweet flavor, more cookie and caramel. Simple, pleasant and underrated, IMO.
Mehana Roys Private Reserve;Hilo, Hawaii, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mehana Brewing Company;Thanks fly! Soft amber beer with little hop aroma or flavor. Caramel flavors, toasty malt, a definite real beer almost worty flavor, a bit of biscuit and maple syrup. Dropped some in the Thanksgiving gravy. Good.

Spendrups Ljust Lager�l 3.5%;Gr�ngesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;Pale golden colour with a white head. Very fruity barnyard aroma of straw and shit. flavour is weak and corny. No suprises here... just short of awful.
Spendrups Ljust Lager�l 3.5%;Gr�ngesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;Can. The colour is clear, pale yellow. The three-finger white foam is notably thick for a lager. The smell is dominated by a simple, bittersweet malt flavour. The carbonation is quite balanced with very small bubbles. Not very refreshing, I think. The taste is quite typical for a Swedish low-alcohol lager: Sweet malt meets a citrus-like bitterness. There is not much of body, probably due to the low alcohol content. But there are some traces of aromatic hops in the aftertaste that brings some stability to the taste. Besides that, the aftertaste reminds of lemonade � sugar and lemon/lime. This is an OK standard beer in the popular Swedish 3,5%-strenght. There are both better and worse examples in the stores. The malts are Pilsner and M�nchner, the hops are Magnum, Perle and Saazer
Spendrups Ljust Lager�l 3.5%;Gr�ngesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;A classic clean Sweedish low alcohol lager. Pretty refreshing. A bit malty and sweet.

Colorado Brewing DoppelZok;Danbury, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Colorado Brewing and Trading Co.;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. 07/01/03: I understand that the guy who made this is a homebrewer. He should definitely try to sellhis product more often! A great beer that is chocolatey with a nice spicy bite to it. The maltiness goes on forever.

Big big bittersweet roastiness, with coffee, chocolate, slight licorice, a hint of cherry, raisin, and a touch of nuttiness. Extremely complex, massive body, wonderful small bubbled mouthfeel. In the vein of Celebrator. Fantastic.
