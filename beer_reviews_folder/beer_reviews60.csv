Madison River Copper John Scotch Ale;Belgrade             ,Montana,United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Madison River Brewing Company;I thought this was decent. Not nearly as sweet as many Scotch ales but has the similar caramelly malt flavor. Worked as a hair of the dog beer.
Madison River Yellow Humpy Hefeweizen;Belgrade            ,Montana,United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Madison River Brewing Company;Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance � The beer is served a hazy golden color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a fair level of retention                                                 ,fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell � The aroma of the brew is somewhat odd and has a mix of yeasty and musty notes. Along with these dominating smells are a little bit of banana and a hint of clove. Taste � The taste starts out with a big wheat bread taste mixed with some yeasty flavors and a good showing of clove. As the taste advances a little bit of banana hits the tongue,although this flavor remains quite light. The clove turns its intensity up more toward the end and is joined by some grassy flavors to leave a rather wheat bready and clove spiced flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the brew is on the slightly more chewy with a carbonation level that is rather low. Overall - Decent,but not the best hefe out there in my opinion. I would have liked a little bit more sweetness with a toning down of the wheaty flavors a bit. Overall though it was worth a try.

Palate: Full body. Thick and a bit syrupy mouthfeel. Quite oaky and bit tannic. Sweet lingering finish with light cinnamon and nice warmth from the alcohol. Overall: The long oak aging process gives this one a really unique profile. The oak really shine which is quite uncommon for an Ice Cider,even for those who are barrel-aged (like Neige R�serve). Extremely flavorful and tasty while still being totally cohesive. Nice balance between the sweetness,the acidity and the oak. One of my favorite Ice Cider so far.

Leduc-Piedimonte Cidre de Glace - R�serve Priv�e;Rougemont, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider-Ice/Fire/Fortified;Cidre McKeown - Domaine Leduc-Piedimonte;"Bottle sampled at Mondial des Cidres de Glace 2014 with Linh, Minh and Angela. $8 for a 3oz sample. Pours a deep, deep amber body with no lacing. Aroma consists of a nice variety of fruit in addition to apple - lychees, peach, maybe some mango and dried dark fruit; however all fruit flavors surrender to the oak character. Mouthfeel is full, rich and syrupy with the oak character coming through above all else; additional flavors of dried peach, apple sauce, cinnamon, wood, light acidity and honey. One of my favorites of the festival."
Greene King The Diamond (Svens Formation);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask Handpump at the Penny Black, Northwich (JDW) 05/07/2006 Some fruit aroma. Copper coloured and fruity with slightly peppery spiced flavour. Some dryness and bitterness in a crisp full malt finish.
Greene King The Diamond (Svens Formation);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask handpull at Folkestone Wetherspoons. Copper colour with lasting beige head. Toffee and hop aroma. Creamy in mouth. Not at all bad. Quite pleasant session bitter with nice sweetish hops on the end.
Greene King The Diamond (Svens Formation);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask conditioned @ Standing Order (JDW), Soton. Mid brown. Sweet malt peachy hops and usual Greene King nutty crystal which is even more out of place here than it usually is. Starts out fairly well but rapidly downhill from there.
Greene King The Diamond (Svens Formation);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Brown amber with bubbly head. Another World cup and yet more beers, this one isn�t bad though. A sweetish hop wih an underlying sharp mineral taste and an eggy sulpher note. Easy playing session beer.
Mynediad Ysbyty Medium Cider;Chepstow, Gwent, Wales;Apple Cider;Mynediad Ysbyty Cider;Polypin @ Southampton Beer Festival 06. A nice fruitiness starts this off with enough rounded acidity to keep me interested and a little chalk in the finish.
Greene King 1966 (Cask);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask handpull at Wetherspoons, Folkestone. I can see what Mungo and imdownthepub are saying, there is some nice red berry malt in this. Copper coloured bitter with disappearing white head. But for me it had a bit of vinegar. Maybe it wasn�t served at its best. Malt is ok but the vinegar element is nasty. May have it again to see if it is in better condition.
Greene King 1966 (Cask);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask conditioned @ Giddy Bridge (JDW), Soton. Light copper. Fruity with strawlike hops. Quite fresh and delicate with a touch to much malt compared to the hops.
Greene King 1966 (Cask);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;Cask conditioned at a Wetherspoons. Amber gold with slight head. Another in the glut of World cup beers this is a bittersweet beer, early hops in the mouth but flabs out to a fruity, malty thin taste. I got a flavour of lychees. There is a delicacy to the beer, so overall quite reasonable.
Arlem Lager Beer;Goa, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Arlem (Aurangabad Breweries/Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);From historic notes, a work colleague brought this back from Goa for me some years back. Maybe it would have tasted ok on a beach in Goa (he had drunk a fair few of these and lived to tell the tale) but my historic notes are pretty disparaging and can�t really be repeated here. Suffice to say it was pretty bad...

Cannon 10000 Super Strong;Goa, India;Malt Liquor;Arlem (Aurangabad Breweries/Asia Pacific Breweries-Heineken);"500 ml can bought at Liquor Shop in Empress Plaza, Tsim Sha Tsui. Three finger head with soapy white foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Fair sticky lacing with fizzy slow carbonation; Very sweet aroma of malt, with strong sugar syrup, honey, floral nectar, fruity esters, light bread, light lemon and light grass; Close to medium sweet taste of malt, with moderate alcohol, pineapples, floral, fair sugar, light bread, lemon and light grass; Medium body. Quite slick palate; Mouth feel is fairly good maltyness in a slick background. Booze and sweetness are moderate at best, not even a hint of cloying syrup, fusel nor knock-ons. Flowery with light lemon to round. Pretty neat!... Hoppiness is light floral, light lemon and light grass in nose and taste; Bitterness is fair for an abrupt, mid to low astringent sweet-bitter malty finish; Wet after taste. Fair sweet boozy and light bitter to mouth. Comments: This is certainly not the ugly fusel monstrosity typical of Indian Malt Likkas, maybe the canned versions for export are different from local bottles? Its sweetness and booze is pretty restrained and it is much more enjoyable than most Euro Strong Lagers. Surprisingly decent!"

Draft at Capone�s, followed by another two drafts at Capone�s. This one is good. It looks like Oggi�s Hop Whompus, a ruddy, muddy, deep brown pour that looks rough around the edges; liks a glass of Schuylkill River water at best. The aroma was a mix of fresh wet hops, heavy scotch aley malt, some dark fruit, and some black peppery notes. The palate was hefty, and the hops were bold, wet, green, and fresh, backed by a huge malt bill that melded greatly. There was no apparent heat at all, and I still cannot believe this is a 12% beer. This beer is outstanding."

BeerMania Mea Culpa Blond;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle (old bottle � 2008 drank in 2016): Poured a clear golden color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing.

Body is about average with good carbonation. Enjoyable though would probably be better if fresh.

Great Dane Aarons 755 Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub (downtown location). Poured a clear dark orange-copper color. Head was thin and off white. Smelled of spicy malt. Dry on the tongue with ample carbonation. Body was disappointingly on the lighter side of the spectrum. Spicy, biscuity malt flavor with a touch of fruity grape candy. Not a bad amber, I�m just never overly impressed by the style.
Great Dane Aarons 755 Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub (downtown): Poured amber with a white head. Aroma, earthy notes, some caramel, light citrusy notes. Flavor, some sweeter malts up front, but they are faint, an earthy, herbal bitterness is more dominant. So so.
Great Dane Aarons 755 Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draught sample at the brewpub, early August 2006. Quite dark, clear amber with a bit of lasting head....carmel and bitter orange, fruity hops in the aroma, a bit of toffee and buttered toast, and hints of almonds, fairly interesting, but....on the tongue it�s impressively bland, watery and reminiscent of nothing more than sugar-water with a bit of caramel...fizzy carbonation doesn�t give this beer any more life. DOA.
Great Dane Aarons 755 Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap downtown. Poured a clear, deeper reddish/amber with a short cap of off-white head. Nose was clean and weaker... leaning toward fruity sugars.. with lightly-toasted caramel. Flavor was stronger with the toasty caramel and lighter fruity malts... accented by a mild herbal bitterness. Smooth on the palate and lighter-bodied.. with a crisp finish. Almost watery at the back-end. Not bad.
Great Dane Aarons 755 Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Tan color with a moderate light tan head. Lots of lace. Minimal aroma - more glass cleaner than malt. Dry irish ale flavor. Lightly acidic and boring. Yup, another amber.
Great Dane Aarons 755 Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;on tap in the brewery a bit better. Biscuis and a lot more bitterness for 07. On Tap at Mallards game. Plastic cup. Not the best place to try this one. Pours an amber brown, slight head. Malty and bit cloyingly so. Heavy for a summer brew and not interesting enough for serious drinking.
Great Dane Aarons 755 Amber;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Tap at downtown location. Pours to a very transparent chestnut brown body with a white head. The aroma is corn syrup and some sort of malt. Perhaps carapils or toasted pale malts. The flavor is corn syrup, lightly smokey/toasted malts, noble hops. Basic borin palate but not offensive.
Thwaites Playmaker (Cask);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;Cask, Last Plantagenet, Leicester. Golden with a creamy head.

Severn Cider Dabinett SV;Newnham, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Severn Cider;From a polypin at the Orchard, Bristol 30/9/2015. Deep amber with a touch of carbonation. Rich, medium dry apple fruit, some oak wood and skins and cores funkiness, leading to a dryish finish. Good.
Severn Cider Dabinett SV;Newnham, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Severn Cider;Polypin @ Southampton Beer Festival 2006. Quite a deep colour. As it was placed on the table I immediately caught a whiff of butterscotchy diacetyl. On closer inspection this overwhelmed almost all of the normal cider character. Rounded medium dry body which was tasty and refreshing and fairly clean. Odd to have so much diacetyl in a cider and necessitated ignoring the smell completely.

Union Pils Original;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovarna Union (La�ko);Bottle, 0.66l, tried it years ago, certainly one of my first beers. I can�t remember much about it, but would say that it was classic thirst killer only...
Union Pils Original;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovarna Union (La�ko);Rating this one from memory. Below average Pilsener, somewhat between the standard Union Pivo and lesser quality Union Pils.
Union Pils Original;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovarna Union (La�ko);10/08 0.66 l bottle from Interspar, Udine. It poured golden body with small head. Cheap malty aroma with some poor flowery hops. Flavor is worse, dusty and malty, quite unclean. Watery and thin in body. Some hops felt only in the aftertaste, which is short anyway. Not really a pilsener, and not nearly good in my opinion, as always from Union. Only drinkable.
Union Pils Original;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovarna Union (La�ko);0.66l bottle that heavy got in Italy and shared with me (thanks!) This does seem different than the other Union beers. Poured a golden body with a small-medium sized white head that went away quickly. The nose is light, oily, with some dusty hopines. The taste is dusty, sweaty hop reminiscent in some way of elder, actually interesting. Very. very light maltiness, not that the body is heavy by itself. Not bad really
Union Pils Original;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovarna Union (La�ko);Bottled. A golden beer with a white head. The aroma is sweet malty with light notes of hops, and so is the flavor, while the body is thin. Thanks yespr for sharing.
Union Pils Original;Ljubljana, Slovenia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovarna Union (La�ko);I cannot even go into a deep description of this garbage. I was awful. Bottom of the barrel for a Pils.

Front Street Norfolk Spring;Fakenham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Front Street Brewery (UK);Cask at The Chequers Inn, Binham, Norfolk, 28-04-07. Tried this after the Binham Cheer and whilst initially I felt that it lacked a little in comparison it was a real grower. Poured similar in colour to the aforementioned beer in that it was a nice clear golden colour. The citrusy hoppiness is there but less pronounced than in the other beer but halfway through I defintaley got a hint of the green tea just when I was believing it to be just a tad gimmicky and I do think that it added something. Very good beer not quite as nice as the Binham Cheer but not far off.
Front Street Norfolk Spring;Fakenham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Front Street Brewery (UK);Cask (gravity dispense), Cambridge Beer Festival, May 2006. A light bodied, golden coloured ale, with touches of citrus and a crisp, dry finish. Decent but I found it a little insubstantial. Supposedly made with the inclusion of green tea but I can�t say I picked that up.

George Wright Roman Black;St Helens, Merseyside, England;Mild Ale;George Wright Brewing;Gravity pour: third of a pint. 9th April 2015, Isle of Man beer festival. Good looking dark brown brew, almost black in fact: on top a full off-white creamy textured head. Not a lot of aroma, some malts maybe. The malts do show heavily in the taste with a semi-sweetness that needs the hops to calm them down (which they do) a bit. Decent and worth trying.
George Wright Roman Black;St Helens, Merseyside, England;Mild Ale;George Wright Brewing;Cask at York Tap. Roasted malt, light coffee bitterness, some sweetness and strawberry in the finish. Decent.
George Wright Roman Black;St Helens, Merseyside, England;Mild Ale;George Wright Brewing;(Cask): Black with a small off white head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate, liquorice and lactose.

Milton Olympia;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;Cask at the Far From The Madding Crowd Autumn Beer Festival. Slightly hazy light orange, a little fast settling white head. Aroma is on the subtle side--which works against it in the less than ideal tasting environment. A fruity aroma that seems hop driven rather than yeast driven--white grapes, apricots, apples. Really soft malt character with a big bright fruitiness--again hard to tell where the yeast contribution ends and the hops begin. A really nice full-flavored ale. Wish I could get this regularly.
Milton Olympia;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), Cambridge Beer Festival, May 2006. Attractive old gold/light amber colour with a thin white head. Well-defined herbaceous hop aroma - prominent but not too strident. Tropical fruits feature in the flavour, with plenty of underpinning orange peel and citrus notes. The mouthfeel is smooth but firm, with a really excellent crisp and slightly sharp grip on the finish. Plenty of alcohol to provide some punch, but not too intrusive. Very assured, measured and nicely balanced. Beer of the festival for me.

Bowen Island Irish Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Kamloops Brewery;"I remember when this first came out when I lived in Vancouver I was so excited that you could get anything called ""Irish cream ale"" for $8 a six-pack. So I can�t say there isn�t a little nostalgia involved in this beer. However...nostalgia has limits, and a whole can of this is a little punishing. Lots of tin in here with a little malt and the faintest hint of roast. Pours clear brown. Taste sours pretty quickly after a few sips. Can."
Bowen Island Irish Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Kamloops Brewery;Not horrible but really, really boring. I was expecting irish cream but instead I got fizzy booze water. :( Aroma is very deceiving...I thought it had some promise with a slight creaminess....but...nope. Not undrinkable but I expected better from a micro...
Bowen Island Irish Cream Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Mild Ale;Kamloops Brewery;355ml can pours a pale amber color with a finger and a half of white creamy head that disappears quickly leaving some spotty lacing. Aroma is cereal grains and grass. Taste is light malty sweet with light hop bitterness. Light bodied with decent carbonation. Just a tiny bit better than a typical macro. Taste is not that pleasant, but then again I guess you get what you pay for and this is sold at a low price.

Gage Roads IPA;Perth, WA, Australia;IPA;Gage Roads Brewing Company;Hoppy aroma with a hint of stone fruit. Golden colour with reasonable carbonation. little haze if any - quite clear. crisp white head which lasted moderately but left good lacing all the way to the end. Taste was quite mixed with a somewhat sweet /malty start quickly over ridden my an almost salty bitterness. Palate is long with a lingering bitterness well after the drink is done. Happy with this, not my favourite but I would happily drink again or order when out.

Gage Roads IPA;Perth, WA, Australia;IPA;Gage Roads Brewing Company;"This is a darn good beer for the price (often one of the cheaper 6s you�ll find at BWS/First Choice). Not a patch on genuine ""craft"" IPAs but has good malt-hop balance. It�s not overloaded with bitterness or dry hop aromas like plenty of IPAs which makes it good for drinking a few."
Gage Roads IPA;Perth, WA, Australia;IPA;Gage Roads Brewing Company;Golden pour. Thin White head. Floral, hoppy aroma. Nice bitterness but a bit one dimensional, although a bit of burnt caramel to it. Not bad, but doesn�t cut it against some of the other local IPAs (sorry, Hop Hog is a great benchmark locally). Could easily knock a few over though...
Gage Roads IPA;Perth, WA, Australia;IPA;Gage Roads Brewing Company;A-- Poured a burnt orange color. Very small creamy white head, does retain its head quite well. S-- balanced between malt and hop smell. not what I expected one bit. A bit of a floral smell to it and just a small amount of citrus. Makes you wish for a USA hopbomb with this lack of smell. Disappointing. T-- I thought more malty than hopy.The hops are there but this is much more balanced than aggressive hops. No real floral taste and lacking citrus. Got a little carmel in the taste as well. M-- No heaving coating in your mouth from the hops or citrus. No real bite in this at all. Well balanced though. Just a little less carbonation in this and it is ok. Still crisp and has a touch of sweetness in it. D-- Well balanced with the hops and malts. Would love a lot more hops and citrus in this. Very sessionable though. At 5.1% could easily blow through a 6 pack. Not what I was looking for at all but it is workable. Excellent color but a little disappointing in the rest of the beer. Please make a hopbomb!!!
Gage Roads IPA;Perth, WA, Australia;IPA;Gage Roads Brewing Company;330ml bottle. Hints of citrus and floral aromas. Nice balance of hops and malt. Lingering hop bitterness on the finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Gage Roads IPA;Perth, WA, Australia;IPA;Gage Roads Brewing Company;Clear caramel colour, minimal head. Not quite as dark as most IPAs. Sweet toffee and roasted touches to the nose. Bitter, oaky flavour followed by the tart aftertaste. Not as strong as most. Not a bad example of the style though, just slightly watered down.

Everards Svengal Tiger;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Everards;Cask conditioned at The Lindale Inn, Lindale, Cumbria. Pale gold with faint head. Quite a bland malty, caramel beer with a lasting toffee note. Smooth but showing its age methinks.
Everards Svengal Tiger;Glenfield, Leicestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Everards;Cask. It was in reasonable condition, but it had quite a soapy flavour, with quite a dry, grainy sort of flavour, bland, watery, flat, limp, void of anything that would make me want to drink it again.

Very much in the line of a golden ale aiming at the lager market. Bit of citrus aroma, bit of hay/hop. Bit creamy in mouth, then sharp lemon citrus finish. Not unpleasant summer blond beer.

Mogollon Split Tail Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mogollon Brewing Company;Another average light beer, intended to be like a Corona or something. Just didn�t hit the spot. Poured golden yellow. The aroma and flavor were balanced of malts and hops (maybe too much hops). Not as light as the bartender made it out to be.
Silverton Mountain Honey Pale Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Silverton Brewery;The smell of fermented honey is balanced nicely with estery hop notes. This ale is clear, with a light, golden color, reminiscent of a pilsener-style lager. Upon tasting, the honey makes its presence known, followed by a slight hop bitterness. The finish is clean. This ale seems to please the domestic-beer drinkers and the geeks as well.

Silverton Red Mountain Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Silverton Brewery;aroma was mild and malty. Pours a nice dark red with a little with head. Nice medium body with good carbonation. Flavor was Chocalate, Sweet and light roast tones. Nice beer.
Silverton Red Mountain Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Silverton Brewery;Had this beer at the All Colorado Beer Fest on 11/10/2007. Aroma is malty with light hop tones. Color is brown with good carbonation and a loose head. Its got a bold malty body with light hop flavor and mild bitterness. Its a good Amber, much hoppier then most.
Silverton Red Mountain Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Silverton Brewery;Draught at All Colorado Beer Festival. Pours clear amber with a spare, fizzy, off-white head, diminishing with spare lacing. Aroma is average malt (cookie, caramel), light hops (herbs, grass), average yeast (dough, meat) with notes of dates and toffee. Medium bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation, and a bitter finish. Average duration, moderate sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.
Silverton Red Mountain Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Silverton Brewery;nice beer, well balanced just the right amount of hop vs malt flavors. amber or red is my favorite!
Silverton Red Mountain Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Silverton Brewery;DRAFT: Deep amber-red hue with a nice and lasting head. Soft and smooth with a mild carbonation. A little chewy, even. Big caramel, with lesser notes of nuts, toast and a hint of earthy wood. Sticky caramel surfaced here and there. Hops were lightly grassy and a little herbal. Dryish finish wrestles with the cloying sweetness. Sweetness got a little heavy at times, but it wasn�t too bad. I would�ve liked to see less sweetness or more bitterness, or both, but it was surely drinkable. RERATE Can: Somewhat meaty Irish red ale with a light carbonation. Hints of dark toast, toffee and bitter chocolate. Zingy hops give it an earthy, plant-like quality. Something in the sweet malts made me think of the candy coating on Boston Baked Beans.
Dubliners Roja;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubliners Irish Pub;Tap at Dubliners. Deep amber color, medium-sized creamy beige head. Aroma is crystal malt candyish. Medium-bodied. Lots of caramel in the flavor. Some yeasty notes, light hops and earthyness in the aftertaste. Semi-interesting.

Dubliners Roja;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubliners Irish Pub;"Draught at Dubliner�s, Buenos Aires. Clear amber, creamy head. Plenty of hay-like hops. Generously malty with thick, well rounded mouthfeel and some sticky honey. More hoppy than most ""rojas"" here in Argentina."

Dubliners Roja;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Dubliners Irish Pub;Amber ale with a thick off white head. Light malt aroma with light floral hops.

Dubliners Negra;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Dubliners Irish Pub;Tap at Dubliners. Opaque black color, small creamy beige head. Toasted aroma with licorice and alcohol. Medium-bodied. Flavor is the mix of coffe and vegetables. Quite watery for this ABV and as Per said 8 yrs ago (!) more Belgian than Irish.
Dubliners Negra;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Dubliners Irish Pub;Smells better than the red but the taste isn�t quite there. The faintest hint of coffee quickly fades into a sour kind of ilk that need not be repeated. Again, go with the red, if any of the house beers.
Dubliners Negra;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Dubliners Irish Pub;Pours Dark with rose to carmel hues. Big, foamy, but not altogether creamy head. Leaves a clean finish. Tastes thin, much more watery than the dark color would suggest. Flavor is smoky a few hints of chocolate.
Dubliners Negra;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Dubliners Irish Pub;Draught at Dubliner�s, Buenos Aires. Very dark ruby, creamy head. Yeasty aniseed aroma. Sweet and fruity with bold, soapy mouthfilling character. An unrefined, rather big beer. Think more Belgian style dark ale than Irish stout. Yeast is dominant with caramel coming second. Fairly low bitterness. Fun, but not really all that good.
Dubliners Negra;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Dubliners Irish Pub;Draft- September 2006 Pours a dark color with some ruby hues. Aroma is toasty. Taste is buttery and bitter sweet. Medium bodied. Interesting porter and very balanced with a nice hop nose.

Dalinger Stout;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Stout;Cervecer�a Dalinger;Draught at Rina Bar & Tapas (ex-Dalinger), Buenos Aires. Completely black with creamy beige head. Obvious coffee aroma. Medium dry with velvetty mouthfeel but a core of tarry malt that is mixed with chocolate. Hops stay in the background, but surfaces as late grassy bitterness. Another solid Dalinger effort.
Dalinger Stout;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Stout;Cervecer�a Dalinger;Draft- November 2006 at Territorio Bar. The beer presents an opaque black color with a CREAMY brown-tan head, Aroma is strong coffee and cacao. Taste is cocoa, espresso and some toffee.

Dalinger Stout;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Stout;Cervecer�a Dalinger;Dark opaque black stout with a thin dark moka head. Sweet, lightly lactic chocolate in aroma with light fruity esters. Nice chocolate malt in mouth with light hops, cherries, and burned coffee. A decent light stout. On tap May 2006.
Berkshire Imperial Porter;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Imperial;Berkshire Brewing Company;Nashville tasting thanks to somebody. A dark black our with a light lacing and gooy sticky lacing. A flavor of chocolate and coffee. A very good choco flavor that is very sutle. overall not a bad beer.
Berkshire Imperial Porter;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Imperial;Berkshire Brewing Company;This was at the Nashville tasting, but I forgot who brought it. Too much barleywine I guess. Pours deep brown/black with a retentive brown head and spotty lacing. Faint aroma of chocolate covered coffee beans. Flavor and palate is tad thin for the style. Flavor of bakers chocolate, plums, with some hints of medium roast coffee. Bitter finish with a touch of alcohol. Not too shabby. I would like to try this again, as this was one of the last ones of the night.
Berkshire Imperial Porter;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Imperial;Berkshire Brewing Company;Cask @ Redbones 6/8/06. Ok nose, sweet & roasty. Familiar porter aroma, Chocolate, coffee, kind of composty and pruney. Dark reddish/blackish brown, small head with good lacing. Bitter sweet flavor. Like aroma with a big roasty bite that dominates but you get a nice chocolate ending. Medium body, oily smooth mouthfeel, Bitter finish with a hint of the abv showing itself. Nice porter from Berkshire, glad I got to redbones early as it kicked when the next customer asked for it.
Berkshire Imperial Porter;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Imperial;Berkshire Brewing Company;Cask (tapped about 20 hours prior) pint at Redbones on 06/06/06. Not exactly bright, but far from muddy, the dull brown liquid, tinted with coal and a touch of ruby, shows medium-low to low clarity. A small, but well-retained dirt colored head sits atop, remaining at cover and providing moderate lacing. A huge blast of chocolate covered roasted coffee beans rise up and seem like a cloud sitting in your face. A touch of candied plum and definite black malt ashiness are also apparent. The black malt seems to dull things, barely allowing the round, simple plum and port-like notes in to the edges. Strong, almost sour-like molasses almost seems smoky. Hops are no where to be found, nor is the alcohol. Strong roast, alternating between barley and black malt (seems like black malt ashiness, with bits of charcoal) provide most of the flavor, while light chocolate and dried dates provide some chewiness. Not really sure what to make of the yeast, seems rather dull, not fruity at all, with very little ester/phenol production. With warming, the roast seems to take hold and alleviate some of the acrid black malt, but the nuttiness builds up on the palate, and some wateriness seems to undercut the usefulness of roast. Still, the flavors are quite strong and clean, with ample chewy mouthfeel. Very low carbonation, no alcohol noted.
Berkshire Imperial Porter;South Deerfield, Massachusetts, United States;Porter - Imperial;Berkshire Brewing Company;Cask pint at Red Bones 6/6/06. Pours a dark brown color with a small fluffy light beige head. Nose is roasty with some nice chocolate notes. Palate is smooth and very fluffy. Flavors are big on roast and chocolate. The roast hits you up front while the chocolate holds back before descending upon your palate.
Two Brothers Old 1713 Scottish Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Draft sample at Dutch's from notes (2012).

Two Brothers Old 1713 Scottish Ale;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Two Brothers Brewing Company;From the February 2014 3R6P tasting +++ Sampled from a 22 oz brown bottle this beer poured a caramel-tan color with a small creamy orange-beige head that lingered and left a bit of lacing.

Medium length malty, nut, toffee and dark fruit finish. Medium body. Ok.

Pours slightly cloudy reddish orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, raisin, pear, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, floral, herbal, light pepper, and toasted earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt with fruity/hop notes; doesn�t smell overly sweet. Taste of caramel, golden raisin, pear, brown sugar, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, toasted grain, light chocolate, floral, pepper, and toasted earthiness. Light amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, brown sugar, toffee, biscuit, nuttiness, light chocolate, toasted grain, pepper, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malt/fruity flavors; with moderate floral/spicy hop balance and zero cloying flavors present after the finish.

Opa-Opa Steakhouse American Wheat;Southampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Opa-Opa Brewing Company;"My Bottom Line: Crisp wheat and juicy citrus fruit lay on the tongue long after the sip has been taken. Light-bodied but never soporific, this American Wheat Ale is an efficient quencher. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam tops the cloudy blond. -The very low hopping leaves a watery void in the finish; strangely, this doesn�t detract from the enjoyment of the glass too much as there are enough flavors to interest you. -Mine was thankfully not served with a lemon. -For such a usually forgettable style, this one was quite the success. On tap at the brewpub."

Guinness Toucan Brew;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Draught. Doing this from memory. Taste and feel of Guinness, a bit more Murphys in the flavour. Oh to be back in the boom days.
Guinness Toucan Brew;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Well, taste pretty much the same as normal Guinness, but sweeter and lighter. I was dying for the real thing after this......
Guinness Toucan Brew;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);This by far is the best of the brewhouse series to date, pity they retired it, had a nice punchy raste and was lighter than Guinness, a good stout for after meals or long sessions

Guinness Toucan Brew;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Draught in Dublin. Same apperance as the ordinary Guinness, but I cannot find any increased hoppiness. It appears more thin and watery, like a Guinness ligt. Most of the elements are there, but less of the roasted malt. A little sourness in the finish, maybe that was the extra hops?
Guinness Toucan Brew;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);They claim it�s hoppier and crisper than regular Guinness, but the only discernible difference is a slightly increased sweetness. I had it on tap in many pubs in Dublin.

I had earlier today a pint of Guinness Draught at St John�s Gate as comparision.
Guinness Toucan Brew;Dublin, Ireland;Stout - Dry;St. James's Gate (Diageo);21/05/06. Tried this side by side with a real Guinness, both fresh, at the Gravity bar, Dublin and my main thought what is the point? Maybe marketing had too much say in this. Grains a little more prominent but why the effort if it is not going to be too different.

Their beers are not sour, if so are old and off. ao please disregard rates including sour references, in fact the 2007 sampler was probably 10 or more years old, Regards, Marcus
Zwickelbier nach Alt-Monschauer Art Dunkel;Korschenbroich, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privatbrauerei Bolten;#198 Das Fazit schon mal vorweg genommen: Ein wahrlich leckeres Bier! Es ist nur minimal tr�b und sieht wie ein Alt aus. Das Aroma ist eher herb als s��lich. Der Antrunk ist sehr weich und der Geschmack herb-malzig. Im Abgang etwas d�nn, aber stets pr�sent. Hefe habe ich allenfalls ansatzweise vernommen. Nicht unbedingt sortentypisch, aber wohlbek�mmlich und schlichtweg gelungen! Anmerkung: Das Brauereimuseum nebenan hatte leider schon geschlossen. Das wird aber unbedingt nachgeholt, denn Monschau ist immer eine Reise wert!! Test vom 14.5.2008, Gebinde: Fass Noten: 12,12,12,12,-,12 - 12,00

Malzig-hopfiger Geruch. Milder Antrunk, in dem das Malz recht allein steht. Im Mittelteil wird das Malz dunkler, steht aber weitestgehend weiter alleine. Im Nachgeschmack regt sich dasnn endlich was, das Bier wird sch�n w�rzig, der Hopfen dominiert hier deutlich Mal fruchitg, mal nussig, Angenehmes Bier!

Zwickelbier nach Alt-Monschauer Art Dunkel;Korschenbroich, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privatbrauerei Bolten;Available at a few shops and pubs in Monschau. Bottle pours dark brown, slightly hazy, with copper highlights and tan, sturdy foam. Sweet malty nose with caramel and notes of cola and currant.

Zwickelbier nach Alt-Monschauer Art Dunkel;Korschenbroich, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privatbrauerei Bolten;50cl swing-top bottle at Hause Bongartz Aldenhoven in Monschau. Enjoyable beer that went well with the hirsch goulash. Muddied browne colour with a short tan head. Caramel and yeast in the aroma. Flavour was sweet with more yeast and bread.
Zwickelbier nach Alt-Monschauer Art Dunkel;Korschenbroich, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privatbrauerei Bolten;Hazy dark almond coloured ale topped by a small, slowly diminishing off-white cover. Surprisingly yeasty for an alt, highly bready and less attenuated than I expect from the style. It has the classic nut notes and grassy hops, but almost muted down by a nondescript sweetness, not even caramelly, just sweetish breadiness. It does not sound very good, but I did not find it so bad, it is well-textured and rather crisp in its carbonation which carries the almost generic flavours better than they deserve.
Zwickelbier nach Alt-Monschauer Art Dunkel;Korschenbroich, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privatbrauerei Bolten;Bottled. An unclear dark brown beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet wheaty with light notes of caramel and a slight acidity from the wheaty. The flavor is very sweet with notes of hard roasted malt combined with an acidic note of wheat, and hints of smoke, leading to a dry bitter finish. The combination making it very refreshing.

Dak Premium Lager;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated July 2006. Bought at the Metro Limbour in Gatineau, Quebec. Came in a 12 pack, and was on special (paid by Ben Dover). Pours a light golden colour with a small white bubbly head, that disappears quickly and leaves a thin ring. All-around decent carbonation. Very mild nose with some sweet malt. Watery boring mouthfeel. Taste nothing until some kind of bitterness hits the finish and then the biggest flavour shows up... corn, in the aftertaste. Boring pale lager.
Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;"(Tap) bright, clear light Amber colour with a small white head; aroma of blueberries, sourdough; balanced flavour with a long, light bitter finish"
Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;Reviewed from old notes. 22 oz. bottle. This one was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was semi-golden hazed over yellow color with a slight transparency about it. Carbonation was seen rising at a moderate pace. One finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Soapy lacing was left in the wake. The smell started off with a blueberry syrupy sort of effect. Rich English-like malts combine to beef up a light crisp setting. The taste was pretty much the same with a light spicy character to add a bit of balance. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. The carbonation was decent for the style and for me. There was a slight creamy sort of blueberry texture rolling over my tongue. Overall, definitely one of their better brews and one to have again. Though slightly missed by me, hopefully one day I�ll get back to Maine to have this again especially in the Summer.
Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;Draft, this one is lame and plain gritty beer no structure or blueberry or hops. Very inpressed
Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;Practically white in color, I could barely tell this was a blueberry beer. I dunno, maybe there was some of it in the taste, but I mostly noticed the metallic twang in the finish and the slightly fizzy sweet wheat flavor that kept it from being a tragedy.
Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;Growler. The blueberry must be an extract because there�s no hint of blueberry color, maybe a seasonal offering can be made with fresh blueberries? That said, it tastes great. There�s a great spiciness from the hops that you get right on the front of the tongue. A �tasty american wheat with blueberry flavor� is how I would describe it. Blueberry dominates the aroma and balances the hops and wheat in the flavor. Yay beer!
Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;8/09/2008: Black Bear Blueberry Ale is clear with a dirty blonde color and an off-white frothy crown. The aroma is sweet, fruity, and floral like blueberry syrup. A good level of fruity and floral nearly-real blueberry comes through in the front and back of the beer although it drops off rapidly in the aftertaste. The middle has a subtle Pale Ale quality to it. There is a mild floral hoppiness in the finish as well that seems to get more prominent which each sip. This beer has a medium-light body and is crisp and clean on the palate. Overall this is a decent Blueberry Ale, but seems a bit more fake than the other one I had earlier today (Bar Harbor True Blue Blueberry Ale). Also, I like the maltiness of the other more as well. This one has more of a Pale Ale base beer to it which is pretty good to but doesn�t seem to work quite as well as the sweet toasted caramel maltiness of the other... My wife puts this one at 2.9 due to the more obvious hop presence and bitterness. I put at 3.0 because the floral qualities of the blueberries pairs well with the floral hoppiness, but I would still welcome a bit more maltiness. 1 Pint 6 fl oz. bottle ($4.30) from Treats in Wiscasset, Maine. Rating #8 for this beer...
Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a light amber with a one finger off-white head. Aroma of light blueberry, and some citrus. Flavor is blueberry sweetness with pale malts, light hops and has a light bitterness
Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;Sampled at brewpub in Orono. A nice fruit beer and very refreshing during the summer. One or two would be about the maximum on this drink but still very nice and good with their calamari.

Black Bear Blueberry Ale;Orono, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Bear Brewing Company;"Any first impressions? -Lofty foam slowly collapses onto the hazy blond. -The sweet blueberry perfume is ably balanced to crisp straw and citrusy, wooden hoppiness. -The delicate blueberry sweetness is overcome by the muscular herbal hop flavor and bitterness. -The frothy carbonation overdoes it off the bat, making most of the malt�s efforts obsolete. What if you dig deeper? -Biscuity maltiness sneaks through the nose, along with peachy fruitiness. -The carbonation relaxes a bit after letting the beer breathe in the pint glass, and merely becomes an effervescent companion to other fitting components. -After a few sips, you could forget the blueberries altogether, the herbal hops and straw-like maltiness take over. -This is obviously their Pail Ale with a subtle dose of blueberry juice, and is another decent quaffer from Bear Brew. Bottle; no date."
Hakkaisan Pale Ale;NIIGATA Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Hakkaisan Sake Brewing Co., Ltd;Golden with an off white head. Sweet malts, light citrus hops, some caramel. Not much flavor. Really light fruits, sweet malts, and a light - I stress light - citrus bit. Smooth, and lightly carbonated body. Not much to this beer, though I can�t say this in offensive. It�s just there.
Hakkaisan Pale Ale;NIIGATA Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Hakkaisan Sake Brewing Co., Ltd;Herbal nose with traces of honey and caramel. Amber body with a fluffy off white head. Some of that goes over to the mouth but falls remackabley flat. Slightly spritzy in the mouth and a faint nutty hoppy flavor but way to thin. Finishes dry and grainy.
Hakkaisan Pale Ale;NIIGATA Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Hakkaisan Sake Brewing Co., Ltd;Amber golden color, soft fuggle hoppy nose, but not really balanced. Body is totally unbalanced, watery, lacking hops, mildly citrusy. Bone dry mildly bitter finish. Needs work.
Kamakura Beer English Ale;Kamakura, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Kamakura Beer Brewery;Light golden amber color. Soft hoppy nose of apples and citrus. Heavy mouth that is somewhat syrupy. Well balanced mouth with apples and touch of winey. Malty finish.
Feral Scotch Ale;Baskerville, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Tried on tap at Clancys Freo for W.A Beer Week. Deep dark body with hues of amber red, light brown head. Some rubber in the nose and then a little hops. Burnt caramel on the taste which softens towards the end of the glass, also milk chocolate, pepper and a little butterscotch, medium body with a lingering, sticky finish. If you like Scotch Ales you should like this one.

Kobushi Hana M�rzen;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;On tap at Marciero. 5% a dark red copper copper pour with a caramel malty fruity tangy taste. The taste is sweet rich malty caramel with a big fruitiness to it. The taste is malty swear fruity flavor, very clean with a bit of a tangy bitter bite. Overall surprisingly solid.
Kobushi Hana M�rzen;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;330 ml bottle. Pours red orange with a small head. Looks really red actually, in a good way. Aroma is wet cardboard, washing detergent and maybe, only maybe some malt sweetness. Definitely not the best part of this beer. Taste is maltier, sweet caramel, has also a subtle bitter kick and succumbs into somewhat fruity and herbal-artficial-bitter aftertaste. Maybe it is the style, maybe am not getting it, maybe it was missed by the brewery - but not my favourite. Can drink it though.
Kobushi Hana M�rzen;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Tap at Keyaki. All of these Keyaki ratings are a mess. Toffee, quite nice. Not so complex but nice enough.

Kobushi Hana M�rzen;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;"Darker than your usual Maerzen; close to a Munich Dunkel. Restrained and refined but with no real faults. Nice malt character with chocolate and caramel, good hop balance to keep the finish dry. Well made, light bodied and flavorful."
Kobushi Hana M�rzen;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Deep bronze color. Lots of body - typical Marzen flavor. Wonder how Japan got such a german influence (schwarzbiers and marzens, for example). This is typical of the style, which I don�t much love. Nevertheless, the product is made with TLC and has no shortage of hops and malt body. A winner.
Kobushi Hana M�rzen;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Deep amber color. It really looks beautiful. Slightly bready nose, med-full body with a dry malty finish. Not bad, but flavors are very retained.
Nikko Syu;Nikko, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Nikko Brewing;Pretty dark for a pale ale, aint�cha? Pours a beautiful, deep ruby, with a small but delliciously creamy off-white head. Clean malt and hop. Caramel malts. Flavor likewise very clean, with mild malts and hops. Perhaps faintly minerally. Moderate carbonation, clean mouthfeel, medium-light body. Clean, well made, refreshing, but perhaps a bit boring.
Nikko Syu;Nikko, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Nikko Brewing;Bottled (thanks omhper!). Clear reddish amber colour, mediumsized off-white fluffy head. Aroma is fruits, wood, some toffee as well as mild herbal notes. Flavour is fruits, toffee, earth and some herbal notes. Strong maltyness and some minerals as well.
Nikko Syu;Nikko, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Nikko Brewing;Bottled at Enya, Nikko. Clear amber, creamy head. Floral hops covering toffeeish malt. Fairly light bodied with enough caramel to cover any edges. Cleaner finish with crystal malt and low bitterness. Quite unremarkable.
Nikko Syu;Nikko, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Nikko Brewing;An unbalanced light amber brew with caramel, peaches and strawberries and a light sour finish. No thanks.
Kobushi Hana Grand Cru;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Tap @ Mile Post Cafe, Tokyo. Pours hazy orange, just a bit of foam. Aroma lets you know about Belgian yeast, also about some sweetness and fruitiness. Followed by taste that displays exactly the same characteristics, with added soap-water. It is actually better than it sounds, it has this candy-sugar Belgian feel to it and actually goes really well with curry that I just paired it with
Kobushi Hana Grand Cru;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Tap at GJBF Osaka 2015. Fresh, sharp fruity nose, quite a bit of yeast. Solid mix of light and dark fruits, some nutty notes in mid palate. Quite full-bodied stuff. Nice to see a brewery give a go at a style not made very often (ever?) in Japan.
Kobushi Hana Grand Cru;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Bottle from Tanakaya, 07/06/2013. Pours golden orange, thin fizzy head, thin ring of lacing. Aroma is light fruits, banana and pear, red cherry, bready malts, Belgian yeast, tripel-like spices, a bit soapy. Taste is caramel malts, spices, moderate fruity sweetness offset by some finishing bitterness, a bit of alcohol. Medium body, dry finish. Alright, true to style tripel.
Kobushi Hana Grand Cru;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Bottle from Tanakaya. Light golden colour, hazy, small off-white head. After a little while it clears and is translucent. Aroma is boozy, sweet tripel-like, very Belgian. Slightly funky, quite sharp, maybe a bit of citrus and some other sweet steeped fruit too. Taste is nice, but maybe a bit underwhelming for the style/compared to the aroma. Solid booziness and sweetness. Basically a run of the mill tripel. Not bad, but not that exciting. Maybe a touch of marzipan in there, orangey, something herbal. It�s nice, but that�s all really.
Kobushi Hana Grand Cru;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;"Bottle bought at Tanaka-ya in Tokyo. Deep honey gold with a touch of orange and a huge Belgian-style head. Clear, surprisingly. Very fragrant, with plums, citrus, cherries, caramel malt, yeast, hops. Sweet and fruity and luscious. Light bodied, lighter than expected carbonation. Flavor of plums, cherries, grass, caramel, alcohol. Very complex; sweet but well-balanced by hop and alcohol. Dry, bitter, hop and alcohol finish. One of the best Belgian-style beers made in Japan."
Kobushi Hana Grand Cru;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;My Bottom Line: Doughy yeast and citrusy tropical fruit mesh into the delicate herbal hop finale of this understated Belgian-style Ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam lies atop the blond mist. -Buried iodine is perceived in the nose only, surely not a good sign of things to come with this bottle-conditioned batch. -The aroma is rather timid for the style. -Base malts offer a lean body and few flavors. -This is neither good, neither bad, just a frank attempt at a style which isn�t tried very often by Japanese brewers. Bottle.
Kobushi Hana Grand Cru;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Lightly hazy golden color with minmal head. Spices, yeast, and fruit are in the aroma. Flavor is a bit muted. Spices, yeast, fruits, and some alcohol. Medium body with a finishing bite. It� alright, nothing spectacular.
Kobushi Hana Grand Cru;Hanyu-shi, Saitama Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Hanyu Brewery / Hana No Kobushi;Golden color, light fruity nose. Rich mouth, fruity, full bodied, mildly bitter finish.

Bauers Kellerbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Leipziger Familienbrauerei Ernst Bauer;Draught as Bauer Kellerpils. Nice refreshing citric aroma. The flavour is also citric in a nice unfiltered way.
Bauers Kellerbier;Leipzig, Saxony, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Leipziger Familienbrauerei Ernst Bauer;From a 2L growler obtained at the brewery, I don�t think they have any plans to commercially bottle this. Cloudy pale yellow, looks like a Wit. Smells very yeasty. Bitter and sour (mostly bitter), extremely yeasty taste. The rather dry aftertaste carries a hint of that distinct �Bauer� note. Chalky feel and a tad watery, but not really thin. Quite nice on this hot day.
Halifax Steam Cock o the North;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;Halifax Steam Brewing Co.;Bottle from brewpub thanks to father in law. Amber beer with small head. Aroma is light caramel and malts. Taste is fruity, spice and malts. Moderate carbonation. Decent. To be honest after the other bottled beers I have tried I was expecting bottling flaws, but this one was ok.

Halifax Steam Cock o the North;Halifax, West Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;Halifax Steam Brewing Co.;Bottle Conditioned, 500ml, from Booths Supermarkets. Brown to Chestnut, slight head. Sweet smooth malty beer with a late hint of hops. Slightly thick on the tongue with notes of plums. The hopping is quite delicate which while appreciated, needs to be a bit more forceful to overcome the sweetness. OK but not great.
Bushwakker Harbinger Maibock;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;Tap. Dark amber with minimal head in an old pint glass. Light on aroma big on taste. Has some nice complexity. Caramel, grain a certain meatiness and nice spice.

Bushwakker Harbinger Maibock;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;(Draught) Lasting thin, white head with an orange amber body. No carbonation. Nose is very limited. Flavour hints of bready, grains and band aid palate but I found this thin in texture and a tad off optimal.
Bushwakker Harbinger Maibock;Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bushwakker Brewing Co.;650ml bomber, fairly fresh ( Thanks Noxious) Pour put a good looking amber-orange protien hazed lager in my stein. Frothy 2 finger off white cap with great retention which laces the glass well. Modest carbonation. Nose is filled with sweet toasted garins, some caramel and light musty grass tones...very pungent as it warms. Medium-heavy bodied. Thick malt backbone. Great creamy-silken mouthfeel. Starts with thick chewy malts creating an impression of liquid toasted muffins with light honey tones and some light citrus from the attenuated hops. Finish is wet, slightly sweet with massive breadyness and a light biscuit after taste....then mild warming from the extremely well hidden alcohol. Although this breaks with style guidelines in that it is darker than a Maibock with Munich malt malodins, has a caramel taste and a marzen malt profile, it IS fine crafted bock more in the vein of a strong Oktoberfest Marzen than a Maibock....very malty, tastey and deeply satisfying. A top flight world class effort by this brewer.

Keyte Triple;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Strubbe;A blond beer, a head is big and white. Aroma is strongly fruity, perry, and then also some apples, hint of spices, simple. Taste has fruitness of perry, some generic spicyness. Medium bodied, high carbonation, as usual. Very simple, but when it's nicely brewed it's not a bad thing. Nice beer.
Keyte Triple;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Strubbe;Golden, with a white head. A bit hazy. The yeast dominates the aroma with some citrus. Taste has some raspberries at the start, then the sweet malt comes in and a slight bitterness at the end. A modest type of tripel, not so overwhelming. Good, though.
Keyte Triple;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Strubbe;Very subtle tripel, not in the slightest overpowering and is therefore deceptively neckable, which would be a bad thing in the wrong hands lol - smooth and decadent taste, if one could be forgiven for using such words to describe a beer. Shared with a friend at Bier Central, Antwerp.
Keyte Triple;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Strubbe;0,4l on tap @ A Capella, Gent. Pours clear golden with a medium head. Aroma is sweet malts with some yeast. Flavor is sweet malts, warm alcohol, some fruits, some yeast, some hops. Good.
Keyte Triple;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Strubbe;Leicht tr�bes Goldgelb mit reichlich Schaum. Malzig, sehr s��, blumig, etwas Pfeffer, leicht muffig-s�uerlich, etwas alkoholisch.
Keyte Triple;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Strubbe;Golden court clear big white head. Aroma is citrus, orange, grapefruit with a beefy malts bashing that comes up after a while, together with some plum. A bit hard to chug down honestly, had much better triples. It ain�t bsd, just outclassed by others in the category.
Keyte Triple;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Strubbe;Pours golden copper with very little carbonation. Taste is a little sour with a dry finish. Standard triple.
Atomic Fusion;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask at the Hop and Barley, Lincoln. Golden colour with a white head. Aroma citrus and light floral. Taste light bittersweet. Light body.
Atomic Fusion;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask at the Victoria, Rugby - 12/12/12. Clear golden with a good sized white head. Excellent full glass lacing ensues! Nose is a little muted, pale malt, light hops and some fruit notes just peeping through. Taste comprises light summer fruits, a little pale malt, touch of hops. Medium bodied with soft carbonation, smooth on the palate, bitter finish. Drinkable stuff but a little bit �mutton dressed as lamb in that the appearance and feel on the palate dragged this one up a notch or two!
Atomic Fusion;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;On cask at The Congress, Longton. A golden colour with a thin head. Low carbonation, fruity start, unusual finish. I can�t make my mind up about this one. Not bad.
Atomic Fusion;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask, Coventry 2010. Bright orange-gold with an airy white collar of froth. Fine musky citrus, freshly-rubbed US hop aroma with a puff of sulphur. Think I�m picking up Willamette, Cascade..Dry and lemony with soap, passion fruit, lychee, a good rasp of hop and husky malts. Clinging wafer and cashew afters. Just about my Beer of the Festival.
Atomic Fusion;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask-conditioned at The Rising Sun, Frampton Cotterell, S Gloucs 12/7/08. Golden coloured with a slight white head. Sulphurous yeasty aroma, as mentioned by others, with a touch of fruity hops. Slightly sweet malt flavours accompanied by some flinty yet fruity hops and a long, dry finish. Unusual in a positive way.
Atomic Fusion;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask at Merton Beer Festival July 7th, 8th 2006. Poured a hazy golden colour with a sulphury nose. I found this beer quite difficult to place It was a little rough around the edges and yet it was very likeable, if you broke it down into parts it actually was a bit messy, appearance not great, I didn�t like the sulphury nose much and yet as a whole it really came through rather well. The hoppiness which I also liked but struggled to compare may have been due to the Mount Hood hops I don�t know that these crop up that often but I think they certainly added a certain something. It had a nice level of bitterness. I would quite like to try some more of their beers pretty good for a new brewery.
Atomic Fusion;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask conditioned at Merton Summer Beer Festival 06. Hazed Gold with no head. Big farmy, sulpherous nose leads to a juicy fruity body. Dry hoppiness with a chalky palate to it, bitter and dry in a long finish. A beer of highs and lows, quite interesting.
Bottle Brook Tar Pit Porter;Belper, Derbyshire, England;Porter;Bottle Brook;Cask (handpull) Old Oak, Horsley Woodhouse. Outstanding, fresh as you fancy, deep body, lovely liquorice nose, hedgerow fruits, touch of roasts... the beer that got mis-tagged as Carpet Porter at Newark BF is an absolute belter.
Bottle Brook Tar Pit Porter;Belper, Derbyshire, England;Porter;Bottle Brook;Cask Stillage at the Black Horse, Darwen 19/05/2006 Liquorice aroma. Dark coloured strong in alcohol and slightly rich on the palate with some fruit flavour and dryness in a meaty slight roast finish.
Bottle Brook Tar Pit Porter;Belper, Derbyshire, England;Porter;Bottle Brook;Hand pulled at the Wellington, Birmingham. Disappointing. Thin, tar-edged. Berry flavours, sour metal and some slight coffee. Hmmm.
Empyrean Lazlos Limited Bock;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Empyrean Brewing Company;Draft pint at Lazlo�s in June 06: dark brown beer with a reddish tint. Subtle toasty malt flavors with an almost nutty finish. But this didn�t sit well balanced for me and in the end was just a mellow dark beer.
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;500ml bottle in 2015. Hazy mid golden with a white head. Aroma of pine, grass and pale malt. Gooseberry, citrus and passionfruit up front, and biscuity malt in the finish.
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;"On tap at a cafe in Christchurch. Everything I expect from a New Zealand IPA; tropical fruit aroma; tropical fruit taste with a grapefruit citrus kick; a bright amber colour and a last white head. Good stuff."
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;On tap at Snakebite Brewery, Franz Joseph, NZ. Darker than expected, aroma of hops, Cascade? Taste is quite malty for a 5.2% IPA, body is spot on for a beer of this strength. Served too cold but warmed up it gives off that hop freshness of a true IPA, better than many of the NZ DIPAs I've tasted so far.
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;On handpull at the Barrel Room. Pours orange brown. Chalk, peach, orange, blackberry, biscuit. Nice full low carbonated body. Fine.
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;500ml bottle. Slightly cloudy, dark orangey, golden colour with average, frothy, moderately lasting, minimally lacing, white head. Piney, grassy, hoppy aroma, caramel malty basis with a bready touch, hints of gooseberry, a touch of red berries. Taste is dry, grassy and slightly piney and minimally floral hoppy, some fresh hay, some husk, caramel malty basis with unmatching hints of toffee. Slightly unbalanced, the toffee touch doesn�t make sense to me.
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;500ml bottle HUGE head which overflowed on opening. Hazy light brown pour. Slight hop/malt aroma. Mild bitterness. Malty palate but not much else. Nothing special. Ho hum.
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;500ml bottle from Good Spirits Co. Wine & Beer. Hazy orange brown, reasonable head. Toffee malt aroma. Grassy toffee malt flavour. Bitter toffee aftertaste. More an amber ale than an IPA.
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;Copper amber pour with thin white head. Light citrus and apricot aroma. Flavor is good bready malts, stone fruit and long bitter finish. Well balanced and easy drinking compared to the beast style ipa.
Three Boys IPA;Christchurch, New Zealand;IPA;Three Boys Brewery;[8316-20160520] Tap. Lightly citrus peel hops aroma. Clear, pale orange yellow body with a huge long-lasting foamy off-white head.

Maltier than my preference but enjoyable. 6-7/3/6-7/3/14 Sampled on tap at the brewery, Christchurch, NZ.
Valley Brew No More Mr. Weize Guy;Stockton, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Valley Brewing Company;Tried at the VBC pub/restaurant. Quite a tasty after work treat that I wasn�t expecting (thanks Steve). Aroma is bubblegum, chocolate, sugar and some raisins and plums come out as it warmed up. I�m sure the aroma would have gotten better as it warmed, but I didn�t have the time to let it get to proper temp. Appearancew was a deep dark brown, nice head retention with a creamy kick to the palate. Flavors were definitely malty, some tropical fruit notes come out on the finish. Overall, an excellent beer that was easy to drink. Very enjoyable.
Valley Brew No More Mr. Weize Guy;Stockton, California, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Valley Brewing Company;Extremely complex yet soft brew. Very reminiscent of Aventinus which I consider the benchmark for style. Dark fruit forward with notes of Black Currant, Raisins, Plums and Merlot. Good spice followthru on a very good round palate.
Pennichuck Engine No. 5 Firehouse Red Ale;Milford, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pennichuck Brewing Company;From Jun 2008 I got this bottle from jwc215. Thanks Joe! This Red Ale pours a dark clear amber with about a 1 finger head of foam. Good head retention and there's some lacing. The smell is of caramel malt with a touch of roasted malt. A good nose. The taste has notes of roasted malt, caramel, grain, and a bit of bread in that order. It reminds me more of a Brown Ale than a Red. I'd say the mouthfeel was on the thin side and the finish has a slightly bitter taste but then becomes watery. Overall, I'd say it's a decent brew but I got fairly bored with it before I finished half of my glass. Appearance and smell promised more than the taste and drinkabilty could deliver. Oh well, I'm still glad I got a chance to try it.
Pennichuck Engine No. 5 Firehouse Red Ale;Milford, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pennichuck Brewing Company;This place is out of business? I may have read that and forgot. The first things that cross my mind are: �did I just start the last rating ever for this?� and �that�s really too bad.� The latter because this is a great amber. It�s really more like a brown, in both appearance and effect. Cola color, chocolate brown sugar aroma. Scratchy malt flavor - sweet and just bitter enough. Must be three years old and it has aged well. A minor success within a cautionary tale.
Pennichuck Engine No. 5 Firehouse Red Ale;Milford, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pennichuck Brewing Company;bottle thanks to blutt59. poured brown with a beige head. aroma was that of zma pills and grain. flavor was multi vitamin pills, chocolate, and grain.

Pennichuck Engine No. 5 Firehouse Red Ale;Milford, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pennichuck Brewing Company;The aroma of sweet malts and dark fruit notes as described.

Pennichuck Engine No. 5 Firehouse Red Ale;Milford, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pennichuck Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Poured a very dark (but clear) red/brown with a very thin beige head (gone in seconds). Aroma: sweet malts, fruits... sort of a raisin, caramel, candy, plum mix. Taste was very much the same but with some water added to the mix. Medium to thin body. Finish was ok. Overall: good but nothing I would buy again... glad I tried it.
Pennichuck Engine No. 5 Firehouse Red Ale;Milford, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pennichuck Brewing Company;8/5/10. 12oz bottle courtesy fsuscott. Cloudy pour, more brown than red, some red highlights when held to the light. Not much head at all. Plain malt aroma, not much going on there. The flavor delivers more of a punch with some roasted coffee and chocolates. Not bad, but somewhat one-dimensional.
Pennichuck Engine No. 5 Firehouse Red Ale;Milford, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pennichuck Brewing Company;The Beer poured with a light carbonation to it, and very small head. It was strong on sweeter characteristics on the nose and followed through to the taste. Hop presence is not here at all. It is straight malt. The 1st taste didn�t go down the easiest but it is growing on me as I am drinking the beer. If I had to say it was like the first time I listened to Tool, I was like woah, whats going on here, listened to the CD (yep�good old cd�s) again and it was better, and by the third time around it was pretty good�.then great. Well we can stop at pretty good for this beer, I dont think it will ever be GREAT, but hey its pretty damn session-able for a 5% beer.
De 3 Horne Myrtilleir Bier;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;1st January 2008 A very crisp beer. Sparkling attack and a champagne like dry finish. The Bilberries are there bit not dominant. Refreshing but heady.
De 3 Horne Myrtilleir Bier;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;330ml Bottle - Dark red in colour with a pinkish/white head. Fruity and slightly tart aroma with blueberries being detected. Sweet, fruity and slightly tart taste with blueberries being very noticeable. The sweetness lingers in the finish, but it�s not particularly strong. Not bad at all.
De 3 Horne Myrtilleir Bier;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;Bottled (CK, BBE 2010). Muddy-murky dark brown-aber color, mostly vanishing off-white head. Odd aroma of glue and fermented fruits. Fizzy, tickling carbonation. Flavor of booze, artifical berry extracts and plum. Acidic and not very good - kind of yeast-went-wrong type of beer. Finnish kilju could taste like this.
De 3 Horne Myrtilleir Bier;Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De 3 Horne;(Bottle 33 cl) Courtesy of yespr/Ungstrup. Hazy, amber golden with a rough, off-white head. Oddly unclean and chemical aroma. Medium body with unclean, chemical fruit accents. Really synthetic and unpleasant. 120108

Hop Back Golden Boot;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Takeaway from cask @ Bitter Virtue, Soton. Mid golden colour.

Grand Union One Hop: Pacific Gem;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask handpull at Wenlock Arms. I don�t think that I will ever tire of this series. Orange/gold colour with thin white head. Farty hop aroma, juicy in mouth and then sharp hop on end. I liked it.
Alehouse Mix Up In A Dixie;St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England;Pale Ale - American / APA;Verulam Brewery;Cask handpull at Wenlock Arms. From the name I should have realised this would be brewed with a strong dose of USA hops, and it is. Deep amber colour with lasting beige head. Grapefruit hop aroma with a bit of cream. Could do with a bit more malt backbone, before grapefruit hop tramples everywhere. Creamyness balances it to an extent, but not enough. Hops are good fun though
Black Isle Wagtail Porter;Munlochy, Ross & Cromarty, Scotland;Porter;Black Isle Brewing;Tasted this porter at the Paisley Beer Festival in April 2000. Cask, handpump dispense. Ruby black in colour with a thin white head. Malty fruit in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Dark malts give a complex base with chewy molasses, dark berry fruits and oak wood notes. Slight hop prickle in the short aftertaste. Malt returns in the fruity raisin flavour finish. An interesting new porter and ideal session ale. Recommended.

Sly Fox Vanguard IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draft at Royersford with a great stuffed flounder dish. The pour is extremely dark coppery, going toward brown, with 2-finger off-white head. The aroma is bready caramel malty, with subdued feety hops, plus some citrus and fruit. The flavor is based on caramel malt, with a solid hop element and a lot of fruit, which gained a slight cherry/blueberry hint as it warmed. This one was very unique and very quaffable, and I know I�ll be growlering it often.
Sly Fox Vanguard IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;On tap at the Phoenixville location. Pours a translucent golden amber with an average off white lacing head that sustained.

Then some fruit to finish it out.

Very good lacing. Flavor was hoppy and bitter. Notes of cherry, brown sugar, and cassis. Heavily bitter and mildly sweet. Long, dry, bitter finish. Medium body. Lively carbonation.

Taste is sweet with malts, a bit of caramels, toffee, and a mild balance of floral and citrus hops.

Montana Ale Works Blue Collar ESB;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Montana Ale Works;Light amber in color with light brown head. Light hoppy sweet aroma.

Kuhnhenn English Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Tap at MBG fest �06. Brown colored with moderate hazing. Some citrusy/pineapple aroma, not as evident to me as some other rates here, Styles mentioned that it was much more distinct coming off the tanks. Medium bodied, tasty mix of caramel and chocolate and a bit of funk in the finish. Quite tasty, multiple layers to dig through as you drink this.
Kuhnhenn English Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Draught. Dark, foggy brown-caramel body with a large creamy off-white head and lacing. The aroma is grassy, herbal, and fruity with apparent tartness. Sweet caramel flavour with sugary stickiness and apple tartness. Interesting to say the least but I personally don�t think that the flavours meshed well together.
Kuhnhenn English Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Draft at MBGF 06. Took a search to find this as it was in festival directory under different name. Copper color with a minimal frothy white head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Heavy complex woody bready tart citrus aroma. Medium to full body with a sticky texture. Solid complex balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of long duration. This is a standout beer.
Kuhnhenn English Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;At the Michigan BGF 06, listed as the English Stock Ale but told that this was indeed the English Strong Ale (By Eric Kuhnhenn I believe): Coppery hue with a small ring of frothy lace. Wow!!! The nose detected a complex brett and pineapple ester with a woody, oxidized, fig, juniper berry, grassy hop, and biscuity malt vapor dancing around the edges. Another WOW !!! Fruity and sour (plum and pineapple) with a toffee malt base that appeared more as it warmed. Sharp allspice and earthy character upon the finish. Then just when I was about to put my pen down I discovered a hint of rye bread and tobacco. Oh, the grapefruit shows up for an encore, YIPPPIE!!! The feel is light but substantial, works wonderfully with the flavor profile. I love it because so much going on, truly not you grandpa�s English Olde Ale. If you get the chance, it comes highly recommended.
Kuhnhenn English Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Darkish colour with white head. Yeast. Sour finish. Tastes older than it is with the addition, I am told, of sulpher and the cultures. Dark Fruity fig tasty and supported by soft carbonation. A good Old that keeps pace with Founders
Kuhnhenn English Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Time to put my 2 cents in on this beer.

I cannot wait to get more of this beer another good beer at Kuhnhenns
Kuhnhenn English Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;On tap: Many thanks to Eric for the sample. Very nice fruity aroma with pineapple, grape, plum, apple, and light alcohol. Dark reddish-brown with some transparency and a moderate off-white head with good retention. Great lacing. Lots of pineapple, dark fruits, grape, and light citrus up front. Finishes with a light fruity tartness and bitterness. This was outstanding.
Kuhnhenn English Strong Ale;Warren, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Sample provided by Eric Kuhnhenn. This was an English Strong Ale that Brettanomyces Claussenii was pitched into. They then let this sit for one year. Because this has aged for a year, I felt that this should be listed as an old ale. There is also some history of Old Ale with Bretta Claussenii/Anomalus. It should be on tap soon and hopefully I will be able to drink a lot more of it then. Muddy brown/amber body with a light tan head, lasting cover. The aroma is amazing. Nearly indescribable, fresh pineapple. Walk into the produce section of your local grocer, find the softest, ripest pineapple, put your nose so close to the bottom of it that it touches, inhale. It smells like that. There are some notes of orange, apricot and grapefruit in there as well. The flavor is light cherries, toffee, mango, some pineapple, grapefruit and hints of vanilla. It is very mellow and all the different flavors are very well incorporated. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth with light carbonation, but the carbonation may be different when this goes on tap. Thank you Eric for letting us sample this incredible brew!

Chelsea Gotham Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;(Old BA rate - tap) Deep, dark black with hints of brown and ruby. Solid tan head, only good retention. Roasted coffee and malt aromas dominate and there is some grainy/bready hints as well. Fantastic stuff. Has the same roasted malt and coffee flavors suggested in the aroma and finishes with bittersweet chocolate flavors. Gorgeous, creamy thicker, filling MF. Superb for the style. Good on the drinkability scale because of the complex flavors were still very well balanced and not overpowering. Chelsea surprised me with this one. Damn flavor-packed for the style
Chelsea Gotham Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Cask Ginger Man NYC - nice looking with great head, coffee and cocoa liquor aromas, taste some earthy mineral and hops are totally dry and fine, verging on sweet, but actually very balanced with a light carbonation.

Chelsea Gotham Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap at Barcade: Deep brown near black with a wispy tan head. Richly roasted aroma with lots of black malt char and a burnt dark fruit sweetness and a light smoky note as well. Slick and lean body- not much carbonation. Very charred flavor. Tons of black malt and burnt barley and a touch of chocolate & dark fruit to balance out the charred flavors. The finish is long and bitter with both bitter roast and some apparent hop bitterness. Solid stout, though tad thin in texture especially considering the heavy dark malt flavors.
Chelsea Gotham Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;to my mind a winner. grassy, earthy and hoppy a nice combination when done right. balanced and a touch spicy not for the regimented this is a good hybrid type brew. chocolate and coffee with a touch of anisette this beer has flavor-s the s being the key for me. yes a touch of acid its just right for the constitution up here in the colder months. refreshing yeah a bit and sweet yeah a bit. light palate filled with more than adequate carbonation. i like this!
Chelsea Gotham Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;Tap at Barcade. Deep dark black beer with a creamy dark brown head. Beautiful rich cocoaish nose with loads of roasted barley throughout. A fairly herbal hoppy aroma over the top as well. Heavy earthy/noble character. The body however seems oddly light for a foreign stout. Not a lot of sweetness or character malts... just a slightly amped up dry stout. It�s very woody and even slightly astringent on the back. A bit of light acidity. Kind of a muted dirty dishwater flavour through the middle that I don�t care for. Overall, it�s not really bad... it�s just not something that I�d typically go for.
Chelsea Gotham Stout;Bronx, New York, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Chelsea Craft Brewing Company;ON cask at blind tiger. Pours a black body with no head. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, roasted malt. Flavor is malty and sweet with some hoppiness. A good offering.

Shoreline Drunken Toad;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shoreline Brewery;If you�re a hop-head, this is the beer for you. The hops in this beer will pick you up by the waist of your pants, take you to the parking lot, and kick your rear end into Lake Michigan. Overpowering hop flavor. Wicked hop aftertaste. The best is watching people take a sample of the Drunken Toad and grimacing.
Shoreline Drunken Toad;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shoreline Brewery;Tap at brewery and served in a 10.5 ounce glass: Hazed coppery hue with a small but lasting frothy head and good lace. The aroma has notes of grassy and piney hops, bready and slight caramel malt, grapefruit and apple, and a touch dusty yeast esters. The taste is surprisingly bitter and citric, this must be dry-hopped. As is the case with most small beer, there is little depth and only a hint of biscuity malt. The mouth feel is very dry and almost woody-like or astringent finish, light and lively overall. Okay beer that is almost too bitter, ESB in some respects.
Shoreline Curse the Goat Doppel Bock;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Shoreline Brewery;Bottle(2010). Oak, cherry, toffee malt and hay aroma. Amber with small head. Very sweet cherry, toffee malt, and mildly bitter hay/alcohol flavor. Good body. Nice.

Aroma is heavy on the sweet, dark malts and has some dark fruity notes mixed in as well.

Quite easy drinking for the palate - very smooth and not particularly heavy. Will definitely have this again when returning.

Pours a rich glowing brownish honey brown hue, orange copper glow on edges and bottom, parts of the body. Faint haze, nice color, small whitish head dies to a ring, laces small. Aromas are gentle toffee, toast, and sticky caramel. Touches of biscuits, gentle red fruit, mellow sweet rich nose offers just a hint of heat and a darker malt vibe as it warms. Initial is medium bodied, lighter end with a good toasty element, some brown sugar, toffee, and toast. Sweet sticky elements work, with touches of gentle cherry, some biscuits, spice. Really nice for the style. Middle gives some touches of toast, dryness, and spice mixed with gentle heat. Some mellow sweetness, gentle cherry into backend. Dry and spicy at times, sweet and sticky at others. The flavors and bigger body play well, flavors work, and overall, the experience was quite interesting. Pretty solid Doppelbock.. A style I don�t normally dig. Nice work, guys.
Shoreline Curse the Goat Doppel Bock;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Shoreline Brewery;On tap at Shoreline in Michigan City. A fairly average doppelbock to me, with some ups and downs. Minimal head on the pour, medium body and deep ruby brown in color. Nose is largely of honey-like caramel/toffee and oaky bourbon. Also some mild soy sauce, that comes through a bit in the flavor. Body is creamy and rich, but without much pop. Rich toffee, sweet honey fruits, light oak, and earthy grains for the flavor. Overall, just alright.

Shoreline Bah Humbug Spiced Ale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Shoreline Brewery;Pint at the pub. Dark brown rusty colored body. Nose is a weird coriander and bran muffin scent. Strange flavor and texture - moldy, fizzy, doughy cake and light spiced bread. Seems like an experiemental brew, like a brown ale with coriander. Blah.
Shoreline Bah Humbug Spiced Ale;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Shoreline Brewery;On tap at brewery and served in a 10.5 ounce glass: I wonder how similar this would be to the version Sam made at his former brewery, since I guess he lost the recipe it would not be identical and I was right. A mahogany hue topped by a light beige head and very tight lace. The aroma has notes of cinnamon, clove, juniper berry, apple pie, caramel, English toffee, and an earthy ester. The taste starts very spicy then a fruity component kicked in before yielding to a yeasty and bready finish. Also noted some vanilla bean and just a dash of noble bitters. The aftertaste is like that of a Christmas Fruit cake, the good one not the crappy kind that no one keeps. The mouth feel is smooth yet there is a biting (mostly from the spices) on the side of the palate, it is a bit too watery for the flavor profile. Another yummy treat, spiced but not overpowering...but why in June?
Flatlanders Emerald Isle Red;Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Flatlanders Restaurant & Brewery;(04.27.06) On tap at Flatlander�s brewpub, Lincolnshire, IL. Poured clear deep red with average white head. Soft carbonation. Sweet malt aroma. Medium bodied ale that started dry with tiny malt sweetness and caramel/fruity flavors. Slight sourness detected (infection?). Middles out with increasing hop bitterness. Finished with light hop bitterness. Decent and drinkable but the sour note was a turnoff.
Rubia y Negra Cream Ale;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Cream Ale;Rubia y Negra;Slightly murky orange-golden color with some yellow hues and a disappearing white bubbly head. Aroma is mix of grassines and some hayness. Flavor is rather neutral with some malty prescence and just a hint of bittersweetness. Medium palate, a bit rough and unrounded. Mediocre mix between a pale ale and a cream ale.

Full-bodied with a dry Porter-like mouthfeel. Malt, chocolate and a touch of coffee make for a tasty flavor profile. The finish is sweet, roasty and lasting, with the maltiness lingering.

Nethergate Crossborder;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;[CASK: The Friendship Inn, Fallowfield, Manchester 30/06/06] I always base my ratings on the drinking of a full pint of an ale and base some of my judgement on how long it takes me to fininsh the drink.

Hartlands Medium Sweet Perry;Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England;Perry;Hartlands Cider;From the barrel at Catford Beer Festival, June 2006. Hazy, peachy straw colour. Big petrol aroma, with a touch of acetone. The flavour is rather at odds with the aroma - sweet, juicy and fruity, but with plenty of tannin to provide backbone and just a fleeting impression of the ketonic elements apparent in the aroma. A delicious tasting Perry that is only undermined by the less appealing aroma.
Hartlands Medium Sweet Perry;Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England;Perry;Hartlands Cider;Very interesting, a little incipit but refreshing, the colour is great and the aftertaste is not heavy.
Hartlands Medium Sweet Perry;Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England;Perry;Hartlands Cider;Cask at Catford BF 06. Pears and petrol aroma. Lots of pear juice. Tannin that coats the gums. Some sweetness, really juicy. Doesn�t taste as it smells. Very comlex and I liked it.
Brains Dry Cider;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Brains Cider;From the barrel at Catford Beer Festival, June 2006. Pale yellow colour. Distinctly dry and quite tannic. Not much residual fruit. A rather austere, traditional farmhouse cider. Which isn�t a problem for me but some might find it lacking in flavour.
Brains Dry Cider;Cinderford, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Brains Cider;Cask at Catford BF 06. Hazy old gold colour with no head. Apple juicy, no real drysour. Bit wet, fleshy. Quite good. Alcohol isn�t obvious, but it packs a punch. Needs more depth.
Bozeman Belgian Wit;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bozeman Brewing Company;Draft at the taproom.. Pours mostly clear straw golden with no real head... Sweet wheat and light lemony essence that seems out of place for a traditonal witbier.. No spicing to speak of... Okay, and very safe.. nothing to write home about.. just sooo very average.
Bozeman Belgian Wit;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bozeman Brewing Company;Pours clear golden with a pillowy white head. Head does not last as long as some Belgian wits but it is pretty while it lasts. Aroma of sweet citrus but it smells a bit like a lager. Crisp citrus taste on the front end followed by the wheat. The taste on the front end is actually pretty strong. I�m not a bit fan of wit beers, but this one isn�t bad.
Bozeman Bozone Pinhead Pils;Bozeman, Montana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bozeman Brewing Company;Poured from can into a pint glass Appearance- The beer pours a golden amber color with a one finger head of pure white foam. The head has a fair level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a decent sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell � Overall the smell is rather light with it consisting mostly of a bready and slightly grainy smell mixed with a little bit of fruit and citrus hop. Taste � The taste begins with a rather bready taste mixed with a little bit of a fruity flavor of some light citrus notes. As the taste advances the sweeter citrus fades ever so slightly all while having some hop flavors of grapefruit and a little bit of a grassy flavor taking the loss of the sweeter citrus�s place. In the end, a moderately crisp and fairly easy drinking flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer is rather light with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the pilsner style the feel is quite appropriate and makes for a more easy drinking and crisp tasting brew. Overall - A decent brew, but nothing all that spectacular. A nice one to maybe session with or to give at least one try to, but nothing to pine over.

Viborg Brown Ale;Viborg, Denmark;Brown Ale;Viborg Bryghus;Bottled. Clear dark brown, minimal head. Lightly roasty malt tries to hide lemon in the nose. Fruity and almost thin with simple malt character. Some pleasant nutty flavuors gives this beer some life, but the lemony flavour from a beginning infection disturbs.
Viborg Brown Ale;Viborg, Denmark;Brown Ale;Viborg Bryghus;Deep Cobber with a brownish head. Sourish smoky aroma with alcohol notes. Sour / acity, but with a profile of roasted malt and hops.

Whirra Calafate;El Calafate, Argentina;Flavored - Fruit;Cerveceria Whirra;Amber ale with a thick rosey head. Berry aroma, with the same problematic wet dough aroma. In mouth, the berries makes this a very astringent brew, pungeant, metallic. Rather original use of the local fruit, but it may just be best to continue with the calafate liquor, which was the best product at the brewpub. On tap, May 2006.

Downton Cherry Ale;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Downton Brewery;Cask conditioned at the Square and Compass, Worth Matravers, Dorset 20-06-06. Sat outside this classic CAMRA National inventory pub on a lovely early summers day. This beer appeared a very pale amber in colour, had a little fruitiness to it. Whilst extremely pleasant I really struggled to detect much in the way of a cherry character. Later in the week I spoke to a Hopback Brewery Rep who help to distribute Downton beers and was that this is going down a storm. I stopped at both Hopback and Downton�s on the way home (both are on the same trading estate) to pick up some bottles etc: I spoke to the very friendly young chap who baiscally operates a one man operation at Downton who confirmed the popularity of this beer, but admitted that there isn�t a great deal of cherry in this, said they had tried to do raspberry wheat beers before and they hadn�t been particularly popular. Still a very good beer and I can see why people like it, as it is very refreshing and moreish.
Downton Cherry Ale;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Flavored - Fruit;Downton Brewery;Cask conditioned @ The Hole in the Wall, Southsea. Hmm Cherry ale sounds unusual I think I�ll give it a try. On pouring a standard bitter appearance, thats odd I would have expected a bit of vibrant cherry colour in this. Mild toffeish fruit and dusty hops but no cherry. Well balanced and drinkable with moderate bitter finish with again no sign of cherry. The barman confirmed this was the cherry ale but despite that I found it a fairly pleasant bitter with no discernible cherry characteristics.
Rebellion Brahms;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask conditioned at Catford beer festival. No diacetly anywhere near this one (did Ian and Chris land a bad sample?). Sweet, grainy biscuit aroma. Dry malt upfront with plenty of hops in the background.

Rebellion Brahms;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask gravity at Catford BF 2006. Amber/orange colour with disappearing white head. I could smell diacetyl from a mile off. It�s overly toffee dominated. Some hop one end, does get better, but still I didn�t like it at all.
Rebellion Brahms;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask (gravity dispense), Catford Beer Festival 2006. Attractive bronzed amber colour. Soft and creamy aroma with a big whiff of butterscotch. That faded away after a while to be replaced by malty elements, which seemed a bit raw to me. Much better on the palate. The usual Rebellion sweetish fruit and malt character is joined by a resinous, grapefruity hop character to produce a nicely balanced beer. Mellow mouthfeel, with dry bitterness building on the finish. Nice beer, shame about the diacetyl - a real cuate�s egg.

Pitch black pour with crimson highlights and a mid-sized, creamy, mushroom-colored head. Decent retention. Other than charcoal, the grainy, carbonic nose introduces very little else.

We�ll start with the regular tap, and use the numbers for that since this is what most folks will run into. Pours black. Aroma is espresso and chocolate. Flavor is espresso and chocolate. Nice, but the finishing hop bitterness is a bit harsh and discordant. The cask version completely cleans this up. It is actually quite similar to the porter in flavor, just with a good bit more heft to the body. The cask would have scored several points higher.
Green Man Stout;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Man Brewery;Pint on tap. Opaque ebony with a lasting film of cream. Aroma of char, semi-sweet chocolate and marshmallow. Taste is semi-sweet chocolate, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, graham cracker, and just enough char on the finish to balance. Medium body is sweet, with medium carbonation and becomes a bit sticky by the end of the pint. Good, but it�s a one-and-done type stout. Just a pinch more roast could make a nice session brew.
Green Man Stout;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Man Brewery;Draft at Bywater. Pours black with a half an inch of khaki foam. Has a bit of chocolate on the nose. Much bigger chocolate on the tongue. Didn�t have it on nitro so I didnt get much of the silkiness. Clean finish. Solid for style.
Green Man Stout;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Man Brewery;on draft at the green man. typical stout nothing to fancy here. medium bodied beer with no head the aroma of coffee, roasted malts and bits of chocolate dominate the nose. the flavor is about the same and its an easy drinking beer.
Green Man Stout;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Man Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Frankly, this was hard to distinguish from their porter, so everything I said about that one applies here too. This is slightly more bitter, which is the only thing my amateur palate could discern between the two. Decent. (#4314, 10/5/2011)
Green Man Stout;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Green Man Brewery;Draft. Murky dark brown color, medium beige head. Aroma of burnt sugar. Taste is milk chocolate. Sweet stuff.
Ricklinger Jubelbier;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;"(on bottle) Very infected; aroma of rotting and fermenting mash. Sour like a Rodenbach Grand Cru, but not on purpose I believe."
Ricklinger Jubelbier;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;"(swing top bottle, received from Jevers Zeuge by trade � many thanks!) Hazy and cloudy orange colour with a fluffy beige foam. Yeasty, medium sweet malty aroma with apricots. Sour-sweet flavour, light to medium body, well-carbonated mouthfeel. Sourish citrus-fruity taste with a shy malty background; acidic citrousy finish. Still drinkable Zwickel and the sourness makes it almost refreshing according to the momentary heat, but I doubt that was intended."
Ricklinger Jubelbier;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;Light hazy golden colour with an off white head. Malty, light acidic aroma with a vague sweetness. Malty and acidic flavor with notes of vegetables.
Ricklinger Jubelbier;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;Bottle. Amber colour with a white head. Sour aroma and taste, acid. Medium body with a sour finish.
Ricklinger Jubelbier;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;A hazy orange-red beer with an OK orange head. The aroma is sweet with strong notes of barn yard combined with notes of oranges, and hints of yeast. The flavor is acidic as if it beginning to turn bad, though it is within the best before date, and has been sitting in my fridge the month from I bought it. On top of the acidity I find notes of oranges, straw, and barn yard, leading to a dry wheaty end.
Ricklinger Jubelbier;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;(Bottle 50 cl) Pours a reddish amber with a slight haze and a small, off-white head. Aroma of caramel and perhaps some apricots. Medium body with the acidity being the first and most prominent feature - sort of a citrusy acidity. Very rustic indeed. I fear that Ricklinger has a problem with their bottled beers. 140606
Ricklinger Jubelbier;Rickling, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ricklinger Landbrauerei;Bottle. Cloudy amber coloured with an off white head. Acidic aroma of malts and fruits. Acidic flavour of fruits. Infected ?
L�pulo Lager;Mendoza, Argentina;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;L�pulo Cerveza Artesanal;Murkey amber lager with a thin collapsing white head. Strong lemony malt aroma. In mout, a nice malt with rather yeasty notes. Rather dismal looking infected lager, not bad, good thing there is no pathogens growing there. On tap, May 2006.
L�pulo Trigo;Mendoza, Argentina;Wheat Ale;L�pulo Cerveza Artesanal;Hazy golden ale, with an extra thick collapsing off white head (had to ask for a refill since 3/4 was head). Light herbal malt aroma. In mouth, a decent wheat beer with some light sweet caramel notes. Light hopping. Light bodied. Confusing wheat. On tap, May 2006.
L�pulo Pale Ale;Mendoza, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;L�pulo Cerveza Artesanal;Hazy dark amber ale with almost no head. Rather herbal, funkey malt with vinegar notes. In mouth, a bizarre concoction of yeast, cloves, and who knows what else. Like drinking a beer after brushing your teeth. Horrible. On tap, May 2006.
L�pulo Stout;Mendoza, Argentina;Stout;L�pulo Cerveza Artesanal;Murky brown stout, like a chocolate ice cream containing water for rinsing (my father would say, like someone who forgot to flush and you open up the toilet bowl the next morning). Not as bad as St-Pierre Stout, but close. A thin stout with yeasty overtones, rather unpleasant. Yes, Fukito, these guys managed to screw up a stout!
Founders Gold Sunshine Summer Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Clear golden pour with a thin white head. Decent aroma and flavor of floral hops and citrus. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation.
Founders Gold Sunshine Summer Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);meh, It�s not bad at all. It�s just nothing to write much about. Light flavor, great palate / mouthfeel, and refreshing without being all annoying and citrusy. It�s OK, and that�s okay.
Founders Gold Sunshine Summer Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Tap at founders. Not too much aroma. Light lager type flavor. This might be the worst beer at founders but doesn�t have the skunky flavor like AB and Miller. Don�t get me wrong, I still would rather drink this than Bud Light.
Founders Gold Sunshine Summer Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap @Founders. Everything about this beer is LITE. It has a LITE yellow appearance with a LITE aroma. LITE wheaty taste with LITE hop flavor. LITE citrus notes and LITE alcohol content. also LITE carbonation. Its actually an OK beer, but I expect more from Founders.
Founders Gold Sunshine Summer Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);on tap at the brewery.Clear yellow, thin white head. Nose thin with slight hips. taste same thin. Some wheat towrads the front.
Founders Gold Sunshine Summer Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);okay...pretty much everything silphium said about this beer is true....macro appearance with medium white head...aroma is very grassy and floral...flavor is a watered down version of their extra pale ale...grassy, wheat, and yeast.....a lame effort by this fine brewery
Founders Gold Sunshine Summer Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. Clearish straw-colored body, thin off-white head. Light grassy, spicy aroma. Flavor starts with dry, biscuity wheat, quickly leading to strange perfumey, spicy hops notes, which dominate the grassy flavors imparted by the wheat. The overall effect is spiked hop water with a touch of alcohol for effect. The worst beer I�ve ever tried at Founders. Thankfully a handful of stellar beers were on tap to assuage my pain.

Secretos del Monje del Abadia;San Isidro, Argentina;Dubbel;Secretos del Monje Cerveza Artesanal;Bottled at Cossab, Buenos Aires. Lightly hazy golden, rich head. Banana aroma. Sweet with rounded mouthfeel and near full body. Malty and spicy. Dominated by orange and cloves. In the end it tastes more like a hefeweizen than a abbey double, but it�s a damn fine hefeweizen.
Secretos del Monje del Abadia;San Isidro, Argentina;Dubbel;Secretos del Monje Cerveza Artesanal;Golden/ brownish color with a very thin white head. Fruity esters, phenolics and fussel alcohols in the nose. Taste is very esthery, aldeihde, banans. Flat, boring. Mouthfeel is medium to thin. Almost no aftetaste.

Shoreline Pinhook Pilsner;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Shoreline Brewery;This draft brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that was long lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated light yellow-orange colored body and an excellent lacing. The mild aroma was mild malt and mild hop. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The weak flavor contained notes of malt and hops. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Shoreline Pinhook Pilsner;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Shoreline Brewery;Draft at Shoreline. Small white head that mostly diminished, good lacing, transparent, no visible carbonation, and a pale yellow hue. Malty, hoppy nose. Sweet, hoppy taste. Tingly mouthfeel. Light-medium body.
Shoreline Pinhook Pilsner;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Shoreline Brewery;This is probably the only beer that the Shoreline Brewery has that is mellow in its palate. While they take pride in the flavorful beers that they make, to me, this is their most palatable beer to the masses. Finishes clean. If you are one of the people that pay $3.50 for a bottle of Bud in the bar, you might want to try one of these instead.
Falls Fuggled Up IPA;Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Falls Brewing Company;"Hum , I am still a big fan of the Fuggles hop but anyone who has this ""beer"" may question my sanity. This beer is undoubtedly infected by the massive head that occurred during the pour and the floaties found within. The aroma is papery and has some notes of lactic sourness. If you breath deep enough you can find notes of fuggles but without warning of a nose full of wet cardboard. The taste (if that is what you wanna call it) mostly tart and sour with just a hint of grassy and herbal hop. Geez I did expect at least a bit of bready and/or biscuit malt given the genre but even those are subdued by the infection. The mouth feel is watery and strangely refreshing due to the tartness which kept the mouth watering. A sad example of a beer, AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
Falls Fuggled Up IPA;Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Falls Brewing Company;This may be the worst beer I�ve ever had. Appearance was not too bad...a dark amber with a soapy head, but with a disturbing amount of sediment. Aroma was of sour milk, and flavor was totally unbearable. No one who has tried this beer could possibly keep it in their mouth long enough to contemplate mouthfeel. All except a tiny sip went down the drain. I bought this bottle at Flanagan�s in Appleton. It wasn�t at all dusty and with absolutely no date coding on the bottle, I�m forced to assume that it arrived at the store from the brewery the day I bought it (3 days ago) and is as fresh as it can be. IF it had a date code, I could draw a different conclusion.
Falls Fuggled Up IPA;Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Falls Brewing Company;"Without going into another tirade like I did with the other beer I rated from this brewery, I�ll be more brief. Infected and putrid with the slight hint of fuggle hops which suggest that this ""possibly"" was originally intended to be an IPA. Thin, watery, lifeless, dull....................."
Falls Fuggled Up IPA;Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Falls Brewing Company;Looks like cinnamon floating on top of the large, bubbly head. cloudy, coppery colored. Heavily malted aroma, mustiness and bitter, spoiled hops i and very sour stuff n the aroma as well. This is one of the least flavorful IPAs I�ve ever had. Just pure bitterness, no complexity, no balance whatsoever. I think something went wrong with this batch of beer.
Falls Fuggled Up IPA;Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Falls Brewing Company;"Bottle from Ughsmash (thanks?) - even the most gentle of pours made this stuff come out all head - lightly bready aroma, with citrus, stale hops, and soap/dishwater - not many american brewers can use british hops well (even when the brits use them they come out tasting stale half the time) - the fuggles do not work well here, although I doubt any hops would - very thin in body and flavor - tastes like water with lots of lemon in it, with a bit of hop puree thrown in the make it ""interesting"" - sour and lifeless, and I�m fairly certain they chose these hops simply so they could give their crappy beer an eye-catching name - down the drain with this!"
Falls Fuggled Up IPA;Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Falls Brewing Company;12oz bottle acquired in trade with ughsmash (thanks!). Opened to a loud psst. Poured a medium amber color and a huge (6 finger) sized off white head. Aromas on the earthy and woody side with light pine and a trace of citrus. Tastes of sweet fruitiness, citrus and had a light sour/tart finish.
Falls Fuggled Up IPA;Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Falls Brewing Company;Bottled. Poured a very nice lighter shade of garnet with an explosive cap of off-white head. Nose was of English-style hoppage with apricots and other fruits.. underlying sour notes were a bit unsettling. Flavor was characterized by sour lighter fruits, with a mild dry bitterness and some caramel backing. Carbonation was high and the interplay between sour, dry, and bitterness was not so good. Cannot say that I enjoyed this one.
Falls Fuggled Up IPA;Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Falls Brewing Company;Copper color with a moderate bone colored head and a fair amount of lace. Dry caramel with just a hint of spruce. Light pumpernickel toast with a light non descriptive bitterness. Seems to have missed some late hopping for aroma and flavor. Not a bad ale, more in the mild category, just not much of an IPA.
Lafrance Cuv�e Lafrance;Saint-Joseph-du-lac, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Domaine Lafrance - Les Vergers Lafrance;Bottle sampled at Mondial 2014 with Linh, Minh and Angela. Pours a clear golden body with no lacing. Aroma is bright apple character, light spice and some dry champagne flavor.

Lafrance Cuv�e Lafrance;Saint-Joseph-du-lac, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Domaine Lafrance - Les Vergers Lafrance;Bottle labelled cuv�e lafrance from an saq store in Mtl. Pours an amber. Smell of sweet apples. A very nice icey cider. The flavour is a nice sweet apple. Yummy
Lafrance Cuv�e Lafrance;Saint-Joseph-du-lac, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Domaine Lafrance - Les Vergers Lafrance;Bottle. Pours a clear golden straw yellow with a medium sized white head whilst pouring, which settles down rather quickly. Sweet crisp apples on the nose, touches of caramel apples. Big carbonation, a touch of yeast, crisp dusty apples. Sweet apple on the finish, lingering tartness, a bit more yeast, bready biscuits.
Lafrance Cuv�e Lafrance;Saint-Joseph-du-lac, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Domaine Lafrance - Les Vergers Lafrance;An intelligent mixture of sparkling white wine dryness and nutritious apple sweetness...Neither side imposes itself, always in total agreement...The champagne carbonation is perfectly done, letting all citrusy connotations and wooden apple character dance together with ease...Another top notch product from Lafrance...
Salvattore Bionda;San Isidro, Argentina;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;Bottle, April 07 at Cruzat. Beatifull, clear, golden copper color with a white, medium, bubbly head. Tastes phenollic, chlorine and watery. I don�t know if infected or bad cleansing. A very slight caramel touch. MF is light, somewhat bare and watery. Astringent, not very enjoyable.

Salvattore Rossa;San Isidro, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;Bottled. An unclear, orange-golden amber with a beige head. Apples and pears makes the aroma. Nice but a bit one-dimentional. Both the fruits is found in the flavor too, along with some hops and malt. Quite sweet actually. A medium-bodied beer with a nice, sweet and fruity finish. One shouldn�t think this is Argentinean. (070119)
Salvattore Rossa;San Isidro, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;330ml bottle. Hazy, dark peach colored body with a big head. Aroma has some apple character.

Beach Chalet Dusseldorf Alt;San Francisco, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Beach Chalet Brewery;"This was the best of the beers that I tried from this brewery. This altbier pours a dark brown color with a decent head. The aroma is of caramel malt. The flavor is nice. It has a sweet caramel malt flavor with tons of backbone--no bitterness at all in this one, but plenty of bold, rich flavor. The mouthfeel is full as well. I reccomend this to anyone who has the pleasure of visiting the Beach Chalet."""
Beach Chalet Dusseldorf Alt;San Francisco, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Beach Chalet Brewery;Draft. Rich amber beer with a low off-white head. Roasty malt aroma. Lighter roasty flavor with lots of caramel and a hint of spiciness. Nice balance. Nice full flavor. Clean finish.
Salvattore Nera;San Isidro, Argentina;Stout;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;"Bottle at Graf Zeppelin. A good example of an ""Argentinian standard dark ale"" this one; near black, some caramel and liquorice flavours, a little bitterness to balance in the finish. A decent beer, tasty and drinkable, yet just a touch safe for me."
Salvattore Nera;San Isidro, Argentina;Stout;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;Botte, April 07 at Cruzat. Deep black opaque color with a nice, creamy, medium sized beige head. Aroma is slight coffee and a mineral touch. Flavor is of burnt, roasted, just some coffee and acid/ sour at the end. Finnishes just too acid, thin and chlorine. MF is light, too thin and can�t sustain the roasted flavors. Almost empty, slightly acid black ale.
Salvattore Nera;San Isidro, Argentina;Stout;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;Bottle. Red black colour with a beige head. Aroma is roasted chococolate. Flavour is also roasted chocolate and coffee, malt. Nice beer.
Salvattore Nera;San Isidro, Argentina;Stout;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;Bottled. It looks clear, but it�s hard to say as it is almost jet black. Tan head. Roasted aroma with chocolate, coffee, cola and some hints of yeast. Coffee, caramel, roastyness and slightly burnt flavor. A medium-bodied beer that is quite nice, yet a bit average, and once again an Argentinean surprise. (070119)
Salvattore Nera;San Isidro, Argentina;Stout;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;330ml bottle. Dark red body with a brown head. Aroma has some roasted chocolate. Flavor is like a mild stout, slightly roasted malt, chocolate and a little hint of caramel. A bit thin and watery palate cut down the score a bit. If the beer scene is like this in Argentina it would be much more interesting than expected. Thanks to Rune for sharing this three Argentinean beers with me.
Salvattore Nera;San Isidro, Argentina;Stout;Salvattore Cerveza Artesanal;Bottled at Cruzat Beer House, Buenos Aires. Barely black, rich creamy head. Aroma of roasty malt with light perfumy notes. Fairly swet with rounded mouthfeel. There�s caramelized sugar and roasty malt, but the malt flavor seems a bit as though hidden in plastic. WIth it�s restrained roasty flavours , low hop rate and bitterness, and rounded mouthfeel it is a fairly well balanced beer very representative for the Argentinian beer scene.

Basil Ts (Toms River) English Special;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Artisan's Brewery and Italian Grill;Draft. Poured a copper body with a smaller off white head. Aroma was subdued but that could have easily been due to the cold temperature that it was served at. What aroma that was there was mostly malty, grain, biscuit, slight toffee, and some citrusy hops. Flavor was really spot on for this one with lots of english biscuit, toffee and a nice slightly bitter citrus finish. This is one of the first beers I have had from Basil�s in quite a while that I actually enjoyed.

A mid brown coloured beer with a subtle blend of sweet malt and earthy hops. Smooth mouthfeel. But its all a bit restrained. Respectable, but didn�t leave too much of an impression

Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;Old ass bottle sitting in the beer fridge like forever. Poured a golden color with a thin sized head. Showed it age for sure ... but not sure how good it would have been new. Still drinkable. Earthy, toasted caramel, cardboard.
Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;23-Jan-11 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 09-Nov-07 for $3.99 at the Pizza Port Bottle Shop in Carlsbad, CA) Who would expect a helles bock to cellar well, but there are always exceptions to every rule, and this beer is delicious. Bright, fruity flavors of fresh apricot, grape, and lychee are complemented by a subtle grassy hop character with low bitterness. The beer comes across as moderately sweet, and there�s also a lovely layer of pepper, spice, and dried herbs for balance and complexity. In some respects, this German-style beer is reminiscent of a Belgian IPA, which doesn�t make much logical sense, but there it is! Malts aren�t a focal point, offering a vague pilsener-like flavor in the background, but are not bready or doughy, and shockingly, oxidation is at a minimum. The nose is grassy, fruity, herbal, and spicy, but balanced by cereal malts. Weight is medium-plus, the finish is pleasantly dry, and the high level of carbonation is very expansive in the mouth, resulting in loud belches and a very heady pour of large bubbles. The body is slightly hazy and golden-orange in color. A fair amount of foamy lacing sticks to the glass. Overall, for a three-year-old helles bock, this is a very pleasant surprise. I expected an oxidized mess and got a terrific gem! Hopefully Bison will brew this again some day.
Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;Thanks to Erika and Manny for the bottle. Pours an orange/gold woth little head. Toasty, caramel aroma. Taste is smooth caramel malt with some nice hop bite. Decent drinker.
Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a small sized head of foamy fine to large sized off-white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a hazy softly carbonated orange brown colored body. The aroma was of dust and mild malts. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a interesting aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of malt and mild soapy hops. An OK brew just nothing special.
Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;Amber with a small head that quickly recedes. No lacings. Aroma is some apple juice, few floral hops. Taste is pretty bitterly hopped followed by a prominent alcohol taste. Like someone poured half a shot glass of vodka in my glass while I wasn�t looking. Some maltiness, breads. Mouthfeel was alright for the style. Drinkability is a bit below average due to the obvious alcohol taste. If you don�t mind plenty of alcohol in a otherwise light bodied beer, give this a try. It cetainly warmed me up! Serving type: bottle
Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;Bottle. Aroma has malty sweetness plus some hops spiciness.

Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;Grassy malt aroma.

Finishes off with lots of sunflower seeds. Grain sweetness. Slightly heavy body, long lightly bitter finish. Burns the windpipe a little.
Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;Bomber pours clear deep gold with wafer thin white head. The aroma is sort of sugar sweet prunes, black grapes and raisins to go along with faint malts with a hint of stale cardboard and even fainter spicy hops. The taste is much the same with an initial pulse of sweet dark fruity esters, some caramel and mildly roasty malts, some of the organic malty stale twang mixing in with light yet building noble hops. The fruity esters and mild caramel create a moment of barleywine style sensation. Above average offering from Bison.
Bison Organic Golden Bock;Berkeley, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Bison Brewing Company;22oz bottle. Golden color. Aroma is of aged malts. Sweet, hints of honey. Bold malt character. Light-medium bodied. Refreshingly tasty.

North Country Slippery Rock Dew;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;Had 13 beer flight on a beautiful custom wood flight.

Root beer flavor at the end Stonehouse stout: On nitro. Guiness feel in the mouth but a bit more boring. Fruit bowl: neat idea, apricot flavor this go around, great summer beer Lavender Abbey: Strong aroma and flavor. Lavender hits you in the face. Polarizing experience.

North Country Slippery Rock Dew;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;North Country Brewing Company;This was a light beer brewed with honey. Its appearance was very light in color with a nice white head. There was almost no smell to it. The taste was good but kind of boring at first-some sweet malt and maybe a hint of honey. But the honey lingers until you take your next drink of it. The mouthfeel was smooth and light. This is a great session beer and its probably a good transition beer too.

Pours like a wheat beer, or a wit bier. Very light and slightly cloudy. Light suttle sweetness. Has a thin white headthat fades in a minute ofr two. Cannot really taste the honey in this brew but it lacks any offensive ill manners or bitterness. Very nice, very friendly. Has just a bit more bitterness than the Northern Lite.

Had a mild wheat bread aroma with some nice honey undertones. Fruity mild hops, and overall a sweet smell. Color is cloudy pale yellow-white, with thin white head. Medium watery body with a good bit of fizziness. Grain bread taste with some tartness. A nice flavor of honey throughout with good drying hoppy bitterness at the finish.

Santa Cruz Mountain Organic Dread Brown Ale;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Brown Ale;Santa Cruz Mountain Brewing;July 25th, 2014 - Next, the Santa Cruz Mountain Brown, a dark, clear and calm looking beer, with a chocolate lab color. The aroma is full of mesquite honey, sweet and smokey, and a delight to smell, almost like I�m smoking a pipe or cigar in beer form. The flavor is quite different, nuttier, but tasty, with a light and approachable flavor, and the complete absence of alcohol. This makes it a wonderful session beer, even though in reality it doesn�t have a sessionable ABV. But it is a delight to sniff, and a slow sipper, too. This is easily my favorite beer on the tasting flight thus far, and it seems like there is a good reason, since this is the first child of the headmaster, and a cornerstone for Santa Cruz Mountain Brewery.

Less overwhelming, good or bad, then many in the same style Squirel Nut Brown: Good rendition for the style Amber waves of grain: Can really taste the caramel malts. Drinkable.

Root beer flavor at the end Stonehouse stout: On nitro. Guiness feel in the mouth but a bit more boring. Fruit bowl: neat idea, apricot flavor this go around, great summer beer Lavender Abbey: Strong aroma and flavor. Lavender hits you in the face. Polarizing experience.
North Country Squirrels Nut Brown;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;North Country Brewing Company;The beer poured great with a nice brown color that passes through very little light, has a nice whitish brown hue to it, and leaves some lacing on the glass. The beer smells great with a well balanced blend of dark malts, mild hoppiness, caramel, and hazelnut. The beer tastes decent as it is very smooth, well blended nutty and malty flavors and balances nicely. The mouthfeel is great as the beer is well carbonated, medium boided, and leaves you with a mild sweet nutty taste. Overall, a decent nut brown ale, different with the hazelnut tastes and isn�t overpowering at all.

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep orange/amber/light copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense and rocky cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with great strength.

Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and slightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%.

Really impressive juicy, vibrant, and lightly dank hops; with a nice complex balancing malt backbone. Almost IPA level hoppiness, but still feels like a true amber ale. A very enjoyable offering."
North Country Stinky Hippie;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Country Brewing Company;Draft at Bainbridge. Mostly clear orange copper pour with white foam.

North Country Stinky Hippie;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Country Brewing Company;Canned, with an illegible date stamp. Nose of caramel and pine, dusky hops. Pour a rich, deep caramel brown, clear with red highlights but still an overall light brown. Head is rocky, and creamy and luscious. Light body with medium bitterness, light but firm sweetness, medium-high resin, little bit of an alcohol numb, mild fruit but stronger wood and nuts. The hops are really nice here but act in an unusual way, lots more earth and husk and resin and wood than dough or citrus (though there is some of that , too), work to meld everything together. Dries somewhat by the end, medium body, very drinkable and a great change-of-pace. [2016.08.31: 3.3]
North Country Stinky Hippie;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Country Brewing Company;Murky ice tea color with very off white head which quickly disappears.

North Country Belgian Nightmare;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;North Country Brewing Company;On draught. Has a very mild aroma. Some light bit of yeastiness and some sweet sugary character, but for a trippel not very aromatic. Clear golden amber with very little head. The biggest descriptor is SWEET. Holy hyperglycemia. The description of the beer on the menu - and I didn�t write it down - was that the brewer had had a lot of problems with this beer. I think another problem was that at 9.2%, there could have been more sugar conversions. Wow - almost undrinkable for me. Had a nice medium watery body with low carbonation. Sweet syrupy floral taste almost masked some good Belgian trippel profiles underneath. Needed more bittereness. Big sweet finish and cloying after.
Munktells Stark�l;Fors, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Avesta Bryggeri;[Bottled at Sundbyholms Slott, Eskilstuna] Clear golden, brief head. Papery nose. Sweet and fruity with somewhat raw and syrupy mouthfeel. Some malt provided medium body. Finished off by stale hops offering low bitterness.
Abbey White Friar;Bath, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Abbey Ales;Golden bronze colour. The aroma is a bit fruity. The taste is toasty-caramel malt background, fruity yeast (apple, berry) and some earthy hop bitterness. Another winner from Abbey Ales.
Abbey White Friar;Bath, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Abbey Ales;Cask @ Star Inn, Bath. Rich golden color. Scant lace. Fruity aroma is lychee meets hops. Summer ale. Soft mouthfeel. Really herbal and floral. Some heather and chrysanthemum. Balanced, nice, I�d call it a summer ale.
Abbey White Friar;Bath, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Abbey Ales;Cask conditioned at The Couer de Lion, Bath. Gold with white head. Quite thinnish for a premium bitter, but still bitter enough with a soft fruitiness. Fairly crisp, but perhaps a little unbalanced. Average.
Abbey White Friar;Bath, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Abbey Ales;Cask-conditioned at the Volunteer Rifleman�s Arms, Bath 11/08/08. Pleasant enough strong bitter, with plenty of red fruit in the aroma and flavour, some caramel and a short dry finish. Drinkable.
Abbey White Friar;Bath, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Abbey Ales;Cask Handpump at the GBBF, Earl�s Court 02/08/2006 Some fruit aroma. Golden coloured hoppy and fruity with some alcohol present. Crisp and slightly dry malt finish.
Abbey White Friar;Bath, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Abbey Ales;Cask at GBBF 2006. Yellow, gold with thin white head. Odd aroma with some citrus. Juicy malt in nice. Bit too sweet and not enough hop to balance.
Abbey White Friar;Bath, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Abbey Ales;[Cask at GBBF] Deep golden. Dominated by butterscotch, but also has notesof strawberry. Sweet and somewhat fruity with medium body. More caramel than bitterness in the finish.
Abbey White Friar;Bath, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Abbey Ales;Cask at The Star, Bath. Fortunate to pick up both the Black Friar and the White Friar in the same session as they are not normally made at the same time. The colour is closer to amber than gold. Plenty of aromatic hops here. More pronounced on the palate than on the nose. Very fresh and clean. Smooth mouthfeel. Maybe a touch soft but a pretty good beer.

Milwaukee Brewing Bittersweet Pull Chain;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Hand-pull. Hazy brown body, frothy white head. Bitter aroma - cinnamon, grapefruit rind over brown sugary malt. Caramel-sweet malt plus brown sugar residualsalogn with some roasty special B-ish malt make up the sweet underbelly of the flavor. Over that is tart leafy hops (EKG). I don�t enjoy the tart hops plus roast over the over-sweet background. Leafy, bitter finish. OK hop belch, however.
Milwaukee Brewing Bittersweet Pull Chain;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Pours to a hazy copper body with a foamy and dense off-white head. The flavor is pretty bitter with a lot of strawberry leaf hops, sweet graham cracker malt. Sweet dark sugary taste lingers on the tongue. The aroma has some pine/citrus hops. Very similar to the regular pull chain but less bitter and lots sweeter. The palate is easier drinking too. Not as resiny and a touch more refreshing.
TwoRows Summer Lite;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;"Tap at Addison location. Light yellow body with a lasting thin head. It is refreshing to see a head stick around on a beer as light as this. Nose-spoiled sweet fruit smell. Taste-grapefruit, sweetish, light creamed corn, nicely ""fresh"" (no staleness or cardboard"", refreshingly tart. there is a sickly sweet rotten fruit flavor that I can�t put my finger on, but it is slightly detracting. But, I guess a light rotten fruit flavor is better than no flavor whatsoever, which is about what one would expect from a Pale Lager."
TwoRows Summer Lite;Dallas, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Pour is light clear pale yellow with almost no head...smell is grainy and sweet...taste is grainy and sweet and rather faint...sticky finish...taste like corn that you MIGHT have eaten, but the flavor is so slight, you aren�t quite sure...
Mooney's Irish Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Dry;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);I wish they still made this stout for Murphy�s. It�s the main reason I went there. Sweet and vanilla.
Mooney's Irish Stout;Dover, Delaware, United States;Stout - Dry;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);I was expecting an Irish dry stout, but this thing was pretty sweet and full of chocolate in the aroma and flavor. Appearance was typical for a stout with a nice pillowy head (served on nitrogen). Sticky thick in mouthfeel, not dry. Old Dominion hasn�t impressed lately, outside of the Oak Barrel Stout
Mogollon AZ Porter Patrol;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Porter;Mogollon Brewing Company;This beer was very unimpressive, poured the clear brown color with a small head and ok lacing. The aroma was of coffee more than anything else. The flavor was watery with some coffee and roasted malts also. The berry aspects of this beer were pretty hard to detect. The mouthfeel was rather thin and somewhat flat.
West County Cider Roxbury Russett;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;7.9% ABV... Doesn�t drink that way... Fairly tannic and something that I associate with clove... I really like this one. I will buy it again.
West County Cider Roxbury Russett;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;"Sampled at a very sparsely attended tasting at 67 Wine & Spirits during the end of Cider Week �11. Though russets aren�t all exactly the same, this was probably my favorite ""single variety"" cider that I�ve come across so far. Clear, pale gold color. Caramel, acid, & apple peels on the nose. Floral, bittersweet taste. A mix of mushy & unripe apple sweetness. Carbonation is nearly full, though a bit reserved. Solid tartness, almost lemony. Leafy, dry finish. Very tasty."
West County Cider Roxbury Russett;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;A golden cider with a nice tart apple aroma, light mineral notes.

West County Cider Roxbury Russett;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Nice golden color with a fantastic aroma of sweet apples, honey, and tart summer fruit. Flavor has a great tannic-sweet apple bite with honey and a great tartness that makes you want to keep drinking this one all day - I think it was around 10% abv, but I left this out of my notes. Fantastic mouthfeel. Best U.S. Cider I�ve had hands down.
West County Cider Heritage Apple;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Bottle at Shelton Festival. Pours a clear orange gold with small off white head that diminishes quickly. The aroma is oak, apple skin, pear. Thin body, similar flavors to nose, nice tartness, light dry finish, very good.
West County Cider Heritage Apple;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;Found this hiding behind some suspect Pennichuck bottles building a nest on a shelf in Charles St. Liquors. 6.2% abv, Dabinetts, Reine de Pommes, Baldwins, & other unmentioned apples. 14k gold color, maybe a touch darker. Appetizing clarity. Smells of honey & citrus. The perceived acid gets my nostrils a bit tingly. Delicate carbonation. Soft, flowery/nectar sweetness. Slightly sappy. Slightly oxidized. Vanilla & citrus finish. More full-flavored then most West County ciders I�ve tried. Tasty. :)
West County Cider Heritage Apple;Colrain, Massachusetts, United States;Apple Cider;West County Winery;750ml Bottle poured at CiderDays 2010. Big blossomy honeyed apple aroma. Pours a middle clear golden. Immediate structure amongst terse carbonaton. I found this one to be particularly elegant and have a really good interplay between sharp tannins, balanced sweetness and cleansing acid. Fresh apple flavors.
Old Capitol Hefeweizen Bier;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Draft at GTMW. Pours a hazy gold with a full white head, with a trace of lacing. The aroma was dead on. Plenty of banana, cloves. The flavor was very clean, in fact too clean. Nothing much stood out in the flavor. A bit of banana, and a touch of caramel. I did not get much from this one. A very simple hefeweizen.
Old Capitol Hefeweizen Bier;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;On Tap. Not bad at all. Served in a tall glass with lemon. Good flavor with a bitter finish. I agree with the other descriptions except mine wasn�t flat or watery, so maybe they�ve gotten better. I would order this again.

Hazy golden color with bubbly white head that left a thin lace. Lots of bananas in this one, especially in the aroma. Banana is dominant in the flavor as well, but is joined by malty caramel and an unusual earthy, grainy note toward the end."

Cloudy golden color with a minimal fzzy white head that mostly diminished with fair lacing. Moderate banana sour citrus aroma. Light body.

Old Capitol Hefeweizen Bier;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;Had this on Saturday with heemer. Mine poured a murky orange golden with no head at all. there may have been a bubble or two. Aroma was of bananas and an off sour smell--didn�t really pique my interest. Flavor had some bananas and clove, but also the off sourness. Watery and almost completely flat. A below average offering from Old Capitol.
Old Capitol Hefeweizen Bier;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;A new arrival this weekend. At least they serve it in a proper hefe glass. The body was very cloudy medium yellow. The head was chunky with a white peach flesh color. The aomra was lemony at first. Then it turns to bananas with a hint of clove behind that. The taste was over ripe peaches with some pears. After a while there was also some banana peel and a little more straight banana. This was only ok. I saw another one poured and it had no head whatsoever, not sure what cuased that. Dirty glass?

Goldener L�we Edel-Pils (F�rst);Eggolsheim-Dr�gendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei F�rst (Brauerei Goldener L�we);Bottle. Light gold and clear. The head retention is low but there is a lasting cap. The aroma has fresh grain predominating and smells more like a helles than a pils. However, the flavors are much hoppier. The palate is very soft, and although the beer is not exceptional it hits the spot. Nice malt backbone and delicious smack of spicy, herbal hops have a Bohemian character. Nutty finish.

Stripper Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coast Range Brewing Company;22oz bottle acquired in trade with cbkschubert (thanks!). Wow, this one is a Collectors Edition - I know so, it says it on the label. My stripper�s name is Mary Riley. There she is, squatting at her pole seductively with her back towards me, her thong calling my name....oh wait, gotta focus. Her color was a light to medium golden with and she gave me an average head. She smelled of yeast (now that puts a picture in my mind), citrus, grain and she was somewhat corny. As I tasted her, I got flavors of some honey, lemons, and lightly fruity. Her body was on the thin side. At least this stripper didn�t cost me a wad on one dollar bills...

Color is a dark amber with a large off white head. Taste is pretty sweet, but quite light on the bitterness. Body and texture are somewhat thin for a Scotch ale.

Tyranena Wannabe Extra IPA;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tyranena Brewing;"Date: 06/24/2006 Mode: Hand Bottled Source: Tasting clear dark amber, sweet grapefruit aroma, big bitter and sweet flavor, nice carmel sweetness, lasting bitterness Aroma: 7/10; Appearance: 6/10; Flavor: 7/10; Palate: 6/10; Overall: 14/20 Rating: 3.4/5.0 Drinkability: 8/10 Score: ***/4"
Tyranena Wannabe Extra IPA;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at the brewery, pint glass. Dope. It�s been a while since I�ve had an IIPA this good. Pours with a fluffy taupe head that diminishes to a dusting with a thick island and ring. Transluscent ruby orange with no visible carbonation. Lace is a thin grainy sheet that�s thicker at the top than it is closer to the surface, where it crumbles away leaving an arch on the glass. Smells like a grapefruit you just cut open after leaving it in the attic for a night: musty, and not quite fresh citrus. There�s also cardamom and an impression of very light, airy bread. Taste is Simcoe hops from the start, transitioning to a great combination of bitting earthy bitter (that�s only faintly metallic) with the expansive juicy citrus hop character, which rides a subtlely caramel and saltine malt base. Well balanced. The earthy bitter makes the finish delightfully dry and chewy after the juicy flavors die out, and the milky carmel persists to add a lactic sweetness to the end. The mouthfeel is perfect, refreshingly medium in body with carbonation soft enough to allow the juiciness to expand in the mouth. It�s like a stepchild of Hop Whompus: not as malty or as juicy, but with some of the family genes shinning through. Again: dope.
Tyranena Wannabe Extra IPA;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Bottle ala Blake. Amber color with a small lid of off-white bubbles. Peaches and pine aromas. Caramel and honey flavors mingle with some pine and light fruit. Fairly light in feel, but still silky and smooth.
Tyranena Wannabe Extra IPA;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Thanks to 1FastSti for sharing this at the Tosa tasting. Aroma is just loaded with pine resin and light tropical fruits. Golden-orange in color with a thin head. Sweet flavor initially then a ton of pine and fruity flavor that blends in a balanced bitterness. Full and creamy body with a drier finish.
Tyranena Wannabe Extra IPA;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Hand-bottle thanks to 1FastSTi: Poured a clear dark golden amber color.

Tyranena Wannabe Extra IPA;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Tosa Tasting - June 24, 2006 Thanks go to Blake for picking this up from Lake Mills a few days ago. It was not fresh from the keg, but it seemed to hold up well enough that I still enjoyed it. Hopefully they�ll have it again so I can compare it to what I had. Aroma / Appearance - Very hoppy, resinous scent reminded me of walking through a pine forest during a time when trees are dropping their needles. The clear golden body had a nice, but extremely short lived, white head which enticed me to take a sip. There was not much carbonation but that could be due to the age of the growler as much as the beer itself, so I won�t fault it for that. If a fresh sample was this dead though it should be knocked down a tenth of a point. Flavor / Palate - Hot and hoppy, this was still somehow easy to drink. Despite the intense initial rush of alcohol once it settled down it become simultanouesly sweet and bitter. The combination impressed me - if this is what Simcoe can do, I look forward to trying more things with it in the future from local brewers.
Tyranena Wannabe Extra IPA;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Handbottled from a growler thanks to 1FastSTI Dark copper color, no head.

Tyranena Wannabe Extra IPA;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tyranena Brewing;Had this beer awhile ago, but didnt think it would be on here. Golden color.

Seabright Sienna Brown;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Brown Ale;Seabright Brewery;Cask at 2006 PP Real Ale Festival. Pours a clear, medium brown color with a small head and just a little bit of lacing. Aroma is malty with a very slight nut hint coming through, actually smells a little like a wet dog. Flavor is ehhh, weak without anything standout... maybe some nut hints and little hint roastiness towards the end. Honestly, this is the first beer I went for because i was so impressed with them at another festival and this just didn�t compare to their other beers that i�ve tried. I would be curious to try it again on tap or in the bottle.

Seabright Sienna Brown;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Brown Ale;Seabright Brewery;(On cask at the PP Real Ale Fest 2006)The brownish-amber body of this brew is topped by a medium thick head with some lacing left behind on the glass. The best way to describe this beer is that it�s like a wet dirty dog. This is more evident in the aroma than the flavor. The flavor had some sweet and roasty notes showing through as well. Light to medium bodied and smooth.
Santa Barbara Hoptometry;Santa Barbara, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;(On cask at the PP Real Ale Fest 2006) Caramel, (not like caramelized malt, like Brach�s) and herbal flowery hops.

Santa Barbara Hoptometry;Santa Barbara, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Nice golden color, low cream color head. Nice grassy flowery aroma. Big strong full-bodied flavor. Good example of a double IPA. Strong malt with stronger hop balance. Nice sticky hop coating on tongue. Santa Barbara Brewing has some great hoppy ales.

Lion Brewery Raspberry Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Draft - Raspberry jam and clotted cream. Hazy yellow with a rich white head.

Lion Brewery Raspberry Lager;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Lion Brewery and Restaurant;Taps a pinkish-orange with a small white head which disappears quickly, some lacing. Appearance is relatively clear except for bits of fruit pulp suspended in the beer. Light body, moderate malt spine , sharp tart mouthfeel a tad weak. Pleasant soft, berry smells in the aroma but not over powering, some grains and light grassy tones. Fruit/berry sweetness and tartness up front give a sweet and sour decernment then the grains balance this with bready tastes... and finsh is fairly clean, tart with a light bittering aftertaste. A very subtle but pleasnt fruit beer for summer sipping

Hops are not as aggressive on the palate as suggested in the aroma; still pretty damn hoppy though; cedary hop flavors at first with a mineral finish; minimal maltiness. Medium to thinner MF; tiny bubbles for carbonation. Easy drinking here even though it�s really hop forward, even for a West Coast IPA, it�s pretty well balanced"

Taps WBL (Wine Barrel Aged Lager);Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);Bottle from the brewery- Transparent deep gold with a slight sediment haze. Frothy white cap lasts and laces fairly well. The aromas here are faint wine and lots of oak woodiness with cereal grains and straw. Tastes of pale malts with a bit of an oomph from the woody oak flavours, with metallic hops and a sourish note leading to the finish from the wine. This isn�t bad, sorta interesting, though I wouldn�t be wanting more than one in a session.
Taps WBL (Wine Barrel Aged Lager);Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);"on tap at c;est what? during spring beer fest. Well i�m definetly getting the oak, and red wine notes. The beer is kinda wattery though, nose is quite woody.

Hazy-yeasty-looking gold with little head and no lacing....tart, tannic and woody nose, not exactly pleasant but fairly distinctive; somewhat like a cheap Bordeaux I guess with a really faint dry hop presence....on the tongue, also dry and woody, thin and somewhat sour, faint pale malts, only a light winey character....um, not horrible I guess."
Taps WBL (Wine Barrel Aged Lager);Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);Gold in colour with a touch of pink. Strong carbonation. Aromas of cherry hard candies, fat cereal grains, and a bit of spicy German hop. There is a definite oak barrel flavor to this one, along with some acidic red grape and apple qualities. There is also a sharp finish which is drying, but prevents any sort of aftertaste from sticking around. I think the oakiness and the acidity gives the beer a slight lambic quality, even though it�s not at all sour. An interesting experiment to say the least, but I think the wine barrel treatment might be better suited to a different style. The beer was probably a bit too thin to start with, and the strong carbonation isn�t doing it any favors. Many thanks to pootz for the sample!
Taps WBL (Wine Barrel Aged Lager);Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);The barrel ageing did impart a wine aroma, and some colour to the sight of it. Sourish acidic mouthfeel and on the thin mouthfeel side. Worth buying to encourage experimentation, and probably well consumed locally. crwills brought this one, so thanks craig!
Taps WBL (Wine Barrel Aged Lager);Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);Draught. Yellow-orange with a small white head.

Taps WBL (Wine Barrel Aged Lager);Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);Tap. Clear gold, fine carbonation, smallish creamy top.

Taps WBL (Wine Barrel Aged Lager);Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);Sampled on tap at the brewery and from a clear 355ml twist crown top bottle: Brewer states that this is their amber premium lager that was cold lagered 5 months in 50 gal oak ( used) wine barrels..some still had a swish of red wine left in them.......... Poured a brilliant golden-amber hue with a rocky 2 finger cap that reduces to as thick surface lace and lasts the drink... Pungent aromas of fresh bread over more subtle aromas of berry fruit and light woody notes... ......... Dense malt spine, medium bodied, creamy mouth feel, mellow-rounded malty character... ........... A big chew of malts up front are soon joined by a balancing dose of herbal hops combined with juicy berry undertones leaves a delicious bready berry-cider decernment mid palate...finishes wet where light woody notes mix with now more medicinal tasting hops,.. biscuity after taste... ......... Seems the oak wine barrels departed very subtle wood and grape skin tastes but more than this the process produced a true wood barrel lagered beer...and this emparts a blissful, mellow drinkable character that you just can�t get from stainless steel tank conditioning...well done guys!, look forward to next year�s batch...this one was delicious and satisfying.

Cream cheese, bubble gum sweet flavor. A touch dry in the finish. A taste of Popsicle here. Not a bad brew. A bit of blueberry that I like is poking a turtlehead out. Ap-3 ar-6 tas-6 pal-3 ov-14
Bluegrass Kylees Smokin Wheat;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Wheat Ale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Pours light golden with a mostly receding white head. Aroma of smoked hickory, toasted malt, and wheat. Taste is husky wheat, mild smoke, and honey malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Not too smokey, I wouldn�t call this a rauchbier. Just a hint of smoke really. This is the first beer with smoked malt that I�ve actually enjoyed, still this is just an average beer.

Goose Island World Cup Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cask at Clybourn. Pours orange with a large white foamy head. A good amount of grapefruit and pine in the aroma. The taste is malt forward with a very slight hop presence and mild bitter finish.
Goose Island World Cup Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Slightly hazy golden orange with a large layer of moderately sized bubbles. A mild aroma of biscuity malt, lemons and oranges, mild pale malt and a touch of graininess. Fairly straight forward mild hop aroma with hints of malt laying underneath. The wood doesn�t seem to add much in the nose at all. The body is fairly full, especially considering the ABV, and smooth on the tongue giving little carbonation.. The flavor starts sweet and shows the malt briefly before a wave of mild bitterness washes through and awakens the tongue. The finish is quick and refreshing, leaving the tongue happy and the thirst slaked. This would be a nice session beer for a day of watching footy.

So happy I was able to try this elusive beer. Very rare. Poured a nice orange Amber color with a very subtle cream head that disappeared very quickly. Had a very sweet fruity flavor that quickly turned into a heavy alcohol flavor. A total malt monster. Very strong malt profile. But for having been almost 8 years old it definitely aged like a fine barley wine.

StoneWall Ale;Escondido, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stone Brewing;Opened tonight with friends, thanks for the opportunity HopasaurusRex and hoppy birthday. Pours a solid reddish brown with a smallish off white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Smells of caramel and dark fruit mixed with a hint of leather and ethanol. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Sweet sugary malts just a hint of earthy hop rolled up in sweet sugary fruits rolled in tobacco and dipped in ethanol. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. This is a really nice barleywine, I�m glad I got to try it tonight. Being as old as this is I wonder what it was like fresh.
StoneWall Ale;Escondido, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stone Brewing;Bottle from 05. Pours cloudy orange with an off white head and lace. Tons of toffee, caramel, mollases pop, very hoppy still and sugary. Rich with a slight dry finish for the smooth body. Sweet tasting beer overall, not as cloying as a jw lees though.
StoneWall Ale;Escondido, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stone Brewing;"Huge thanks to drabmuh for sharing this one. Served in a Stone goblet. Pours a light copper color with a short head to start, fading quickly to a thin collar. The aroma has some nice cookie qualities with sweet malt and some nice sherry-like oxidation notes. A bit of caramel and toffee in the background. The taste continues down the same path -- lots of malt here and oxidation has done good things to this one. Nice caramel and toffee notes along with some sweet candy and a hint of fruit. Malty and good. Feel is medium with lowish carbonation; really smooth with almost no alcohol presence. Really nice. I�m thrilled to finally get to try this one. Thanks again, Matt."

Karlskrone Lagerbier Hell;North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aldi Europe (Nord / S�d / Hofer);Review: Bottle of Karlskrone Lager 4.90%ABV Brewed for the German supermarket chain, Aldi but only for their Swiss chains, Karlskrone is an affordable lager that comes in a 500 ml plastic green bottle, with a screw cap. Having a volume of ABV of 4,9% the beer is a good thirst quenching bargain at roughly .49 Swiss cents, a cent for each volume! Pours a nice clear golden coloured beer, and a decent sized head formed with quite good retention, some small lacing afterwards. There was a clear strong aroma of grainy malt and stale hops that smelled of straw/rice. The smell was very sweet. The taste was also very sweet and left a sickly bitter aftertaste that took a while to get used to. The flavour was of sweet grain and malt. After the initial shock the drink settles on your taste buds and eventually becomes a rather refreshing drink. It is a nice slow burner, that grows on you, and for the price it sells at, its excellent value.
Karlskrone Lagerbier Hell;North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aldi Europe (Nord / S�d / Hofer);Golden, thin head, (best b 12-08) weak one, but lots of carbonation, little hops, most boring one.

Nose of light hops some lemon and malts. The flavor is a bit hoppier than I was expecting, but Snake River sometimes surprises me. Finishes balanced, but surprisingly thin. An excellent summer drinking beer, but doesn�t have the body, the biscuity character or any of that other goodness I require in any beer regardless of style.

Moab Brewery Squeaky Bike Nut Brown Ale;Moab, Utah, United States;Brown Ale;Moab Brewery;12 ounce can Looking through the selection of New Year�s Eve beers I opted to try this one based on the name. The results didn�t quite live up to the label. Even so there might be worse brown ales. I am at least willing to give Moab Brewing another chance down the road. Aroma / Appearance - An ivory head graces a calm rusty brown hued foundation. Tea and malt tickle the air with a light sweetness that is unremarkable. Flavor / Palate - Carbonated iced tea splashes across the tongue before fading into a faint memory. The simplicity does not spark much excitement. Even a brief spicy kick can�t redeem an average brown ale that fades into the pack like a tiring rider during a sprint finish.

Sockeye Stonefly Wit;Boise, Idaho, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sockeye Brewing;On Tap at the brewpub. A very murky yellowish tan with a large creamy off white head.

The belgian flavors were faint but pleasant, wish it had a little more body.
Sockeye Stonefly Wit;Boise, Idaho, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sockeye Brewing;Tap at brewpub: It has the look of lightly colored homemade apple cider -- murky with a white head and sticky lacing. The aroma was pretty mild - seemed to be ripe bananas, yeast and butterscotch. The taste contained flavors of sweet spices, mild bananas and the aftertaste was like a bowl full of Wheaties! The body is thin and the feel almost watery. Not bad, just not something I would have regularly.
Sockeye Stonefly Wit;Boise, Idaho, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sockeye Brewing;Tap: Muddy orange brown color, light head, some lacing. Nose is yeasty with lots of citrus and light esters. The flavor is nicely hoppy and sweet, thick wheat flavor along with the overpowering yeast. Chewy hefe with a nice floral hop finish. If the hops weren�t here in these levels, this would be awfully difficult to drink.

Roosters Brewing If I Were a Maibock;Locations in Ogden and Layton, Utah, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Roosters Brewing Co.

Shed Double Hoppy Illumination;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled draught (half-pint) at American Flatbread in Burlington. Absolutely gorgeous to look at....burnsihed gold-amber with faint dark yeast speckles floating in the heavy seas, beautiful creamy lasting head and thick lacing....earthy, loamy scents are very quickly overtaken by agressive dry woody hops which become more and more pungent and somewhat funky as it warms.....lightly alcoholic texture evident right away in the body, earthy spicy-hoppy notes and a gingery sharpness that grows strong....quite acidic and hard if not harsh at the finish, though there is alwas a softness that keeps things mellow enough to continue drinking. An intriguing if not wholly successful meld of saison and a strong IPA, probably one of the more interesting examples of this type to emerge from the Shed to date, though the drinkability factor is rather low....it�s certainly not thirst-quenching. Well worth a try at any rate.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;This draft brew from the restaurant in Fort Wayne, IN poured a small sized head of frothy white colored medium sized mostly diminishing bubbles that left behind a hazy dark orange colored softly carbonated body and a poor lacing. The aroma was almost non-existent. The mouth feel was thin and watery. The flavor was of soft malt and very mild hop.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;draft - Pours golden with a one finger white head. The aroma is light malt and a little citrus hops. The flavor is pretty light with mild hops and sweet caramel malt. When it warms up enough, it ends up being pretty decent though still somewhat too thin.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;On tap at Rockford Granite City. Pale yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of mild citrus hops. Tastes a little like watered down apple juice with some light hops and an astringent finish. Luckily this brought my sampler to an end.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;Draft at Fort Wayne, IN location. Small head that mostly diminished, spotty lacing, hazy, no carbonation when served, and a dark golden hue. The nose was citrus hops, grapefruit, lightly malty, and some caramel. The flavor was very thin and watery, mildly hoppy, some caramel, and citrus. The mouthfeel was smooth, thin and watery. Liight in body. An easy to forget brew that had next to no body, very watery and left me drinking more of my ice water than this beer. I have yet to be impressed with GCF&B�s beers. Another case of the food being better than the brews.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;Not bad, a bit light in flavour and aroma but it was an easy drinker. Golden coloured with a creamy white head. Creamy flavoured with some sweet malts.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;Draft in Omaha. A golden yellow. Up front has a little of the twang reminiscent of Millers Lager, but with a very different hop profile. A nice refreshing hop balance. Not heavy, clean crisp finish. Not my favorite style, but drinkable.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;Draft, Cedar Rapids, IA location. Poured a slightly hazy dark golden color. Head was white and quickly dissipated to a thin film that left a bit of lace behind. Aroma was of light malty caramel and a touch of noble hops. Flavor was similar with the addition of subdued grape candy. Body was on the lighter side with carbonation on the heavier side. Crisp, clean finish. Eh, not bad, but nothing to write home about either.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;Put it this way - if I homebrewed a cream ale, I would want it to taste like this. If I made an American pale, I wouldn�t. Pours a lightly hazed straw gold, topped by about half an inch of sudsy off-white foam. Good head retention, very good webby lacing. Mild floral hop aroma and a hint of sweet butterscotch candy. Mild, but decidedly flavorful little ale - with some sweet caramel malt generously balanced with a floral and lemony hop bitterness. Light bodied, brightly carbonated, crisp and clean hop finish and aftertaste. An exceptionally refreshing beer. I enjoyed the first one before the food arrived, and then ordered a second. I found it a bit too timid to stand up to food
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;Draft in S.D. location. Clear pale color with an average fizzy white head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Light sour citrus aroma. Light to medium body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Light sweet flavor with a sweet finish of moderate duration. Refreshing light brew.
Granite City Ostaras Spring Ale;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Granite City Food & Brewery;Refreshing with decent hops. Clear golden. A bit of citrus. Not great. Had in KC.
Ringneck Hefe Weizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Brew Kettle;Tap at the Brew Kettle. Pale, mostly transparent yellow pour. Aroma is more or less typical � sweet, banana-like, bubblegum � with a little steamed artichoke, crushed sunflower seeds and sesame. Pear sparkler flavor with a pungent, sour mashed garlic burst. Crisp. Mildly sugary. Palate is light enough to be mistaken for a dry soda, with ginger root and straw intimations. Smacks of lemonade and a little bitter bite. Reasonably refreshing, but leaning too sweet.
Ringneck Hefe Weizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Brew Kettle;On tap at the Brew Kettle. Poured a hazy straw golden with a tall cap of creamy white head. Nose was quite strong with banana esters, lemongrass, and crushed cloves... rather sweet. Flavor was even sweeter and almost sticky... with lemon-soaked wheaty tart notes, bubblegum, and rising spices at the tart lemony finish. Grainy on the palate.. tart lemony finish was refreshing. Didn�t flow as well as it could have. Nice summer brew overall.
Ringneck Hefe Weizen;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Brew Kettle;One of my few Ringneck disappointments. The wheat doesn�t really come through well, and the yeast created more phenols than esters making it seem a bit astringent and bandaid like. Still drinkable, though.
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;Draught sample at the brewpub, early August 2006. Opaque jet with a lasting smidgeon of fine dark topping....toasty grains, medium roast coffee, lots of prunes figs and grapes in the delightful nose, though no smoke that I could detect....body quite fruity and sweet, chocolaty-figgy-grapy with sharp roast taking over midpalate and a rather spicy finish....full and thick with moderate carbonation.
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;from tap. poured black with leight beigy head. light body and starts clean but roasted malty chocolately and smokey flavors finish at the end. would go great with food
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;"On tap at the Brew Kettle. This was a beautiful beer... deep mahogany pour sported a creamy cap of chocolatey-beige head... leaving some intricate lacing behind. Enjoyed the nose of rich roasted dark chocolate, overtones of freshly-ground espresso beans, and smoked peat... well-balanced albeit not overly complex. Flavor found about the same stuff.. with dark chocolate and espresso providing a lasting impression. Smoke presence was ancillary, and provided nice highlights. Palate was smooth overall, but a tad grainy across the middle... almost a ""4"". I could drink a whole lot of this!"
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;Rich beer with almost stout-like roast levels. There�s a bit of astringency, perhaps in part from the smoke phenols, but the smoke itself is a bit reserved and blends well with the chocolate notes. Noticeable American-style hops. Good balance to the brewpub�s bread pudding.
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;22 oz bottle. Very dark brown with a full tan head. Has a smokey chocolate undertone to it, smooth, finishes roasty. Thanks Drew!
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;"Nitro tap: Not sure if this is the smoked version or not, but the tap says it is, chalkboard does not! Dk brown w/ a lasting beige head, fantastic lacing and ruby highlights. Chocolate & light roast aromas, light woody hop & hints of caramel. No smokiness!!! Rich chocolate malt w/ hints of roast in the flavor; well balanced to lightly bitter, but sweetened by chocolate; lightly acidic from dark grains w/ a chocolate & caramel finish. Fuller bodied & creamy smooth, but there seems to be a lightly gritty m/f like cocoa powder has been added to the beer. I�m just guessing, but the m/f is more full for the style, as well as screaming chocolate IMHO. My initial thought was that cocoa powder was used, but I could be wrong. Another very solid beer from BK, but I don�t think this was the smoked version since I didn�t pick up any smoke at all!"
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;Slight smoke aroma. Dark, dark brown with small light-brown head. Smokey flavor! Too smokey for me. Like chewing on a piece of coal or burning wood. Still an easy drink with a dry finish. Overall, lots of flavor, but too much smoke. Hard for me to drink too much of, as smooth as it was.
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;Pours a robust rich dark brown, with a thick tan head that leaves a sparse lace behind as it subsides. Aroma is sweet and malty with notes of chocolate, roasted coffee beans and a nice smokiness, not quite as in your face as the Schlenkerla line, but very noticeable. Incredibly smooth and full body with a great balance of a caramel vanilla-like sweetness and woody smoke. A very nice smoked porter that I could drink as a session beer and not be in the least bit disappointed. Cheers to Drew for sending this jewel to me!
Ringneck Smokin Porter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Porter;The Brew Kettle;Dark brown/black, tan head, good lacing. Aroma is sweet smoke (although it could've been stronger). Smooth and malty, sweetened coffee/chocolate with cream. OK, so where's the smoke? - swallow - OH! Here it is - somebody just dumped charred wood into my mouth! (and I mean that in a good way...). Super intense smoke flavor along with hints of oak coat my tongue. You might want to try this with some of the pub's smoked meats. This is smokey enough to be in the same league as Schlenkerla - Impressive!
Mickey Finns Ole Stock Pale Ale;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;(04.27.06) On tap at Mickey Finns, Libertyville, IL. This double IPA poured clear amber with an average sized head. No discernable carbonation. Caramel and sweet malt aroma. Full bodied beer that starts very sweet with pronounced caramel flavor, almost like liquid candy. Finished pretty much the same but with notable hop bitterness. Definite alcohol presence. Light syrup in the mouth. A cloying sweet, totally unbalanced beer with a rough finish. Not one of Mickey Finns� better beers.

Unibroue U Miel;Chambly, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Unibroue (Sapporo);Pours an average size creamy looking head. Has an amber appearance, fairly dull clarity. Weak lacing. Aromas of sweet grainy malts, mild honey notes. A bit of corn scent also. Flavours are mostly corny and grainy malts. Mild spices and resin hops. Some dryness. Hints of caramel and honey sweetness. Watery mouthfeel, faint carbonation, light bodied. Not too bad, cheap Unibroue variants to the mass produced brews. Price is right and you get what you pay for.

The aroma is quite spicy, with some caramel, orange zest, and raw grain in there. The flavor is very caramelized, almost burnt. And very grainy. Toast and yeast come next. Occasionally some grass. The finish is spicy and a bit floral. I didn�t care for this much.
Foothills Dunkelweizen;Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Foothills Brewing;Draught. Pours a pretty, ruby pour with a neat tan head. The aroma is of caramel, mild toast, biscuits, a dash of corn. It�s noticeably corny in the mouth and after visiting flavors of caramel apples and papery hops, finishes like a spoonful of Wheaties. This is certainly not one of the finer beers showcased by Foothills.
Foothills Dunkelweizen;Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Foothills Brewing;Sampled at RBSG 2006- Grand Tasting. Pours dark amber to light brown with a thin off-white head. This has an unusual off flavored tartness that can be smelled as sour and tasted. Flavor is almost vile. Perhaps it did not transport well?

Korona Ksiazeca;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;500ml bottle - shared by estpivo - thanks! 4+ Gently bready aroma, I think they�ve shown this a picture of a hop. A touch of vanilla. 1 Gusher. A non-BC bottle gushing - that�s almost unforgivable, behing harsh with score. Colour was pale straw and head was large but brief, normally a 2. 4 Simple plasticky malt taste, typical for pale lagers. 2 Thin palate, fizzy carbonation. Finish has a hint of a drop of hop essence. 6 Typical cheap macro lager. Didn�t know it was Van Pur when I drank it, but it fits right in with the rest of theirs.

Korona Ksiazeca;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;500 ml can from a polish lorrydriver. Pours almost golden with a big fluffy white head. Weak grainy aroma. Taste is on the sweet side, almost no hops detected, so nothing to balance the malts here, sorry but this wasn�t any good.
Korona Ksiazeca;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;No 277 Rated: 15.12.2007 Can, 500 ml, 10.5 P Appearance: Pours brilliantly clear, fine filtered, shiny, bright golden body, carbonation of the body is soft, characteristic for a classic Premium Lager type rather than a Pale Lager. Head is initially mnedium and systematically decreasing to small and than a minimal froth, fair lacing, head white and foamy, regular in structure. Aroma: Chalky, a bit hoppy (aromatic hoppy nose), some hints of grainy maltyness (not sweet thought), cask wood hints, nice aroma of a classic lager type, refreshing beer with good quality hops so called (pils). Some citrusy freshness, hint of lemon. Generally weak aroma, not intensive. Flavour: Aromatic hoppy nose, some bitterness on palate, flavour reminding watered Bohemian Pilsener or some good quality lagers from Perla Lublin brewery, no additional sweetness, refreshing, grainy on palate, nice balance between aromatic hops and maltyness, some accidity, and hints of metal. Generally very positive and good taste for a cheap price, very good alternative beating many macro brewes, often over comercialized. Finish duration is rather short. Palate: Body is light, texture is wattery, carbonation is medium on palate, finish feel is a bit metallic, chalky, alcohol is well hidden, grainy, interesting and pleasureable.
Korona Ksiazeca;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;Pale golden, vivid carbonation, average head. Grass, herbs and dark bread in aroma. Quite clean taste with pleasant herbal notes, a bit metallic. Rather bitter and dry.
Silver City La Fat;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Silver City Brewery;Draft, Belgianfest. Murky dark brown, not much of a head. Slightly tart, yeasty coffee and nuts aroma. Very malty, nots of brown sugar, caramel toast, dark fruits, a slight tartness around the middle along with yeasty frutiness, finishes with a little spice. Very interesting.

Silver City La Fat;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Silver City Brewery;Bottle sampled on 8/29/08: Pours a transparent dark copper amber with a thin-lacing wispy off-white head. Aroma of rich sweet dark caramel and molasses with a touch of bready Belgian yeast. Body starts with good fullness and rich sweet dark malts drying some toward a doughy sticky finish. Seems like a Scotch ale with a Belgian yeast.

Silver City La Fat;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Silver City Brewery;Rich amber brew that has lively carbonation. Though categorized as a strong ale, aroma and taste would indicate a barleywine. Aroma is thick with malt and dark druit, apricot, peaches, tangerines. The brew is similarly flavored with rich malt and fruits, with some dashes of chocolate malt and candi sugar. To me, this is a highly sippable, mildly hopped barleywine.

Silver City La Fat;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Silver City Brewery;750ml bottle at Uber. Pours a dark reddish brown. Right off the bat, this brew is malty as hell. It�s a lot like brown shugga or a very old Old Bawdy from Pike - molasses, brown sugar, sweet malts, etc. The alcohol counters, but this one�s really sweet. It�s earthy, full-bodied, and very good - I can�t believe this brew is out of Silverdale - a tad bit of cherry cola, and some dark fruits, with a mild carbonation... but still, it�s just a little too sweet.
Silver City La Fat;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Silver City Brewery;"750 ml bottle - thanks riversideak!! dark amber with flat white head; smoke, chocolate, yeast and scotch; drinks super smooth with a healthy dose of rich, brown sugar and spice; dank fruit with sweet finish; quite interesting and one i really enjoyed"

Lengthy finish: basic dried fruits, chewy maltiness and some lingering bitterness."

Pours a slightly hazy, dulled orange-amber color; creamy, fluffy light-tan head with good retention and creamy lacing; great pour. Slightly bland aroma, showing straightforward dried fruits and caramel; underdeveloped. Mouthfeel follows suit.

Grand Teton Paradise Pilsner;Victor, Idaho, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Bottle at Argo0 pre-RBSG tasting on 13 July 2006. Clear, pale gold colour. Yeasty, with some spicy and candi-sugar notes. In fact it had a distinctly Belgian feel to it. Not bad at all but doesn�t really come over much like a pilsner. Rather too sweet and syrupy for one thing. To be honest, I think there are some styles that aren�t really best suited to imperialising - pilsner may be one of them.
Grand Teton Paradise Pilsner;Victor, Idaho, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;Pours a deep golden yellow. Nice aromas of hops/citrus/peppery. Nice hoppy flavor, spicy/pepper, alcohol shows up in the back end. And once again I love the bottle.

Grand Teton Paradise Pilsner;Victor, Idaho, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;"2006 750. Pain-in-the ass wax seal. Watching Ernest hack through it with a butcher knife and a pair of pliers might have been the highlight of this tasting experience. Beer is murky, light yellow-gold with an average-sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing head. The aroma is kind of cluttered. Malty with light notes of toasted grain; Hoppy with light-to-moderate notes of resin/pine; Yeasty with a trace note of dough; Moderate miscellaneous notes of pineapple, cloying bubble gum, warm alcohol, trace of something that smells like plastic melting in the sun.

The body is medium, the texture is velvety and the carbonation is lively."
Grand Teton Paradise Pilsner;Victor, Idaho, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Grand Teton Brewing Co.;1L bottle. Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium to dark yellow, bottle conditioned.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. The booze shows through quite strongly, and some very unpleasant aromatic characters make this drift into Malt Liquor territory (shudder). The Hallertauers are nice, but overall it�s pretty crude.

Pours a pale yellow with almost no head. Looks almost like a white wine. Starts with some sweet apple and then becomes more Granny Smith apple in the middle with tartness increasing in the finish. Light vinuous notes in the background. Nice and refreshing, but not a huge cider fan.

The flavor had citrus, oranges, grapefruits, grasses, lihgt caramel, kinda lemony with a hint of spiceiness. The mouthfeel was lihgt and crisp and very bitter.

Kuhnhenn Pear Cider;Warren, Michigan, United States;Perry;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Golden with no carbonation whatsoever, syruppy legs. Very faint pear in aroma, not much else. Flavor much the same. Crisp, dry, clean. Decent overall.
Kuhnhenn Pear Cider;Warren, Michigan, United States;Perry;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Bottle: Aroma is rather peachy (and I did use a different glass then the one I used for the Peach Cider), with light pear. Pours a pale uellow with a white head that fades very quickly. Flavor is a mix of peach and pear. More tart than the apple and peach ciders. The more I drink the more prominent the pear flavors become.
Turtle Mountain Ninja Imperial Stout;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Stout - Imperial;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Pours opaque black with a brown nitro-head. Aroma is of dark chocolate with notes of coffee and piney hops. Body is med-thick and has that nitro creaminess that I hate. The flavors are sweetish and chocolatey. Their is an underlying coffee flavor and a descent roastiness, but the malt character is really lacking. The finish is nicely bitter but doesn�t really last. Tastes more like an FES.

(US);on tap in layton 7/23/2010. orange colored pour with a small white head. floral rice-like aroma reminds me of cheap sake or mass produced pale lager mixed with some pils-like graininess, orange and honey. the flavor is similar... mildly better than the combination of aromas and a bitter-ish straw-like finish. medium bodied, slick and smooth yet crispy. 5/3/5/3/11/2.7

Taste is big coffee - thin body - somewhat earthy, grassy, bready, caramel notes and brown sugar. Light body with medium carbonation. Pretty good, but would highly benefit from added body.
Town Hall Mocha Java Double Brown Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;5 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 3-28-15. Pours brown with a bronze hue and a slight haze. Nice, beige head. Looks pretty good. Definite mocha in the nose. Coffee, caramel, and chocolate scents, in that order of prominence. Coffee flavor with sweetness. I don�t like coffee, unfortunately, so the smell and taste don�t do anything for me, although I suspect coffee fans would like it. Coffee been flavor. The coffee becomes less prominent on multiple sips, which is good. Medium body. Smooth and somewhat frothy in the palate. Could be a lot worse as a coffee beer.
Town Hall Mocha Java Double Brown Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear deep brown with a slight amber hue and a tan head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a rich mocha note backed by dark grains and a hint of roasted malts.

Almost fully opaque with a small off-white head. Tastes like cocoa has been added. Has an instant coffee, hot cocoa aftertaste which docks a point for palate. Still, a mooth and nice brew.
Town Hall Mocha Java Double Brown Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Poured from a growler courtesy of robertsrealty. He sent this to me probably over a month ago and I am just getting around to opening it now. I must say that this brew traveled perfectly. Poured with a huge head from a somewhat vigorous pour. Recedes slowly. Mixture of chocolates in the aroma. Definately some milk chocolate along with a hint of dark bittersweet chocolate. Some coffee aromas along with plenty of roasted grains. Quite yummy and the coffee is not overpowering which is nice. Dark brown in color with a hint of red along the edges. Body is a little on the thin side. Plenty of roasted grains and coffee in the flavor. Coffee overpowers the chocolate flavor a bit. Some bitterness from the coffee also along with carbon and a hint of tartness. Maybe from the storage. Minimal though. Finish is dry and a little chalky with a lingering rich roasted coffee flavor. A very good pumped up brown ale and one the will appeal to the coffee lovers. I myself do not drink coffee and am still finding this one enjoyable.
Town Hall Mocha Java Double Brown Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Deep brown pour with a ruby tinge and a tall, fluffy layer of tan head. Mild, but satisfying malty aroma of unsweetened chocolate and whole wheat toast. Medium roast coffee and toasted almonds also enhance the somewhat predictable bouquet. Medium bodied, lightly creamy mouthfeel. Some lightly dry mocha flavors and a hint of coffee create the majority of the flavor. What am I bothering to describe this brew? The name says it all. Well constructed, albeit predictable way of accomplishing its namesake goal.
Town Hall Mocha Java Double Brown Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Guess I would of called this a Mocha Java Stout but as JK said,no Brown Ale. It was very much a Starbucks creation.lots of chocolate and bitter cold coffee.Thick and tasty for sure.
Town Hall Mocha Java Double Brown Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;How in the world is this a brown ale? It looks like a stout, smells like a stout and tastes like a stout. This beer fits perfectly in the sweet stout category. It has a strong coffee aroma and some chocolate as well. Flavor has the same qualities, but the coffee seems less fresh giving the beer some cold, stale coffee flavor. But it works for this beer. This is the smoothest coffee beer I have had at Town Hall, and these guys make a few of them. Black, medium sized but thin tan colored head.
J.K.'s Scrumpy Orchard Gate Gold Hard Cider;Flushing, Michigan, United States;Apple Cider;Almar Orchards;Cloudy golden colour. It's a bit buttery, definitively some vinegar, but not too acidic, and quite sweet too. Messy, pleasant, it's really like drinking vinegar and sugar.

J.K.'s Scrumpy Orchard Gate Gold Hard Cider;Flushing, Michigan, United States;Apple Cider;Almar Orchards;Pint can poured to a Czech-pils glass at Lunar Brewing Co., displaying a hazed gold color, with a bubbly layer that quickly diminished to no head, film, or lacing. The nose was fruity perfume, sweet apple, and light spice. Light bodied, with very low carbonation, the taste was similar notes as the aroma, quite sweet, and 6% that wasn't very forthcoming. Tasty enough, but to appreciate and finish 16 oz., I need less sweetness, and a dryer finish.
J.K.'s Scrumpy Orchard Gate Gold Hard Cider;Flushing, Michigan, United States;Apple Cider;Almar Orchards;Pint can, Wine Warehouse. Pours light gold. Aroma is apples all the way - somewhat sweet smelling. Flavor is crisp but sweet apple - actually quite good - very appley and not cloying. Just the fainted bit of carbonation makes this really good. I'm not a fan of sweet ciders, but this is tasty - this is a step above in the sweet category.

Aroma brings out medium apple sweetness, with a little farmhouse funk, and some light tannins. Flavour is quite sweet for a scrumpy, with very little farmhouse character, with medium sweet apples.

Pierre Huet Cidre Bouch� Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;Sample from trade with Sjogro, cheers Sjoerd! Golden colour with a thin white foam head that quickly dissipates away. Aroma of fleshy apple, some caramel. Taste is sweetish fruity apple, fleshy with woody funk, vanilla & caramel hints, and barrel notes. Medium bodied, spritzy carbonation, dry fruity woody finish. Nicely drinkable.
Pierre Huet Cidre Bouch� Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;Bottle from the source, shared first at home then at Maakun�s. Clear golden with some greyish bubbles. Sweet musty earthy and fruity apple juice, some very light almond spice and lemon rind. Quite dry, old oaky and musty. Under medium body and soft carbonation. A bit thin but nice.

Pierre Huet Cidre Bouch� Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;75cl bottle from the producer. Well, despite my comments last time it appears I am drinking this again. And the perfumed element appears to have subsided somewhat. Good balanced brut, nothing too exciting, no real complexity, but has a decent fruitiness. Drying close. Table cider. 75cl bottle. Pours a misty gold, small white head. Floral apple fruit aroma. Taste is generally clean with a fleeting fuzzy texture.. distinct perfumed notes aligned with a moderately sweet character. It�s decent, but the perfumed element is a bit off-putting for me to try again.
Pierre Huet Cidre Bouch� Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;Bought directly at the cidery. A fairly big operation, but as with many other Pays d�Auge cideries, they seem to be all about Calvados, offering many vintages that could be my father for instance, but only one Brut cider, and one at 4% with residual sugar levels that I would say are above average even for a Normandy brut. Very juicy, apple-forward example. Kinda corky and earthy which seems to be a tendency if I read other ratings and may therefore not be related to the cork taint itself in spite of my initial light fear. Not a particularly complex, nor funky example. Just juicy, more bitter than acidic apple varieties. Not bad, but there are so many similar examples out there that this is not one I�d seek again.
Pierre Huet Cidre Bouch� Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;Bottle sample at a tasting, thanks rayaron. Clear copper orange color. Aroma is funky, apples, barnyard, stinky cheese and notes of sulfur. Sweet-sour, green tart apples, a bit of acetone, funky. Light and dry. Decent.
Pierre Huet Cidre Bouch� Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;Bottle, cider tasting with the HBB crew. Lightly hazy gold, lively head that fades quickly. Aroma is funky, basement mustiness, rind of Brie, underlying apples. Big funk up front, lots of musty cork, lightly medicinal, with apples and honey. Very dry finish, light. I liked this, but the sweetness seemed a little clashy with the funk.
Pierre Huet Cidre Bouch� Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;Bottle shared at a tasting at Tom L place. Very clear golden with quickly diminishing white head.

Pierre Huet Cidre Bouch� Brut;Cambremer, France;Apple Cider;Calvados Pierre Huet;750ml bottle (Stockmann, Riga) Quite a sharp dry aroma, clearly apple, apple skins, a little estery, bit not sweet. Very dry in the mouth. Slightly watery body, but it�s a 4% French cider, so I expect that. Nice dry apple skins, dried apple. Simple, but very tasty. Nicely refreshing.

Mikkeller Ping Pang Pale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mikkeller;20061111 Sample at Cornboy�s BW meet.

Mikkeller Ping Pang Pale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mikkeller;Bottle, courtesy Ungstrup (at GBBF), August 2006. Slightly murky, mid brown appearance. Off-white head. Really prominent juicy, resinous hop aroma. Sharp and fresh on the palate, although the flavours are less intense than the aromas. A slightly fizzy mouthfeel and a touch too much residual sweetness for my taste detracted a little from my enjoyment but still a pretty fine beer.
Mikkeller Ping Pang Pale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mikkeller;Courtesy boboski. Murky amber/burnt orange. 2cm of dense, frothy light tan head. Aroma of pungent, past ripe fruit, florals, resin, caramel, light spiciness. Similar flavor is more mild than aroma and adds a dry, airy, yeasty finish. Medium body, well carbonated, perhaps overly so. Solid brew, unique.

Aroma has lots of hops with a very floral, herb-like side to it. It has feel of roses and a musky edge to it as well. Creamy mouhtfeel - perhaps a touch low carbonated.

The aroma is very sweet - just a bit cloying, and with notes of alcohol, bourbon, over ripe fruits, and spices. The flavor is also very sweet, almost being cloying, and with notes of malt, caramel, spices, alcohol, and bourbon, leading to a dry finish. Too cloying for me.

Powerful barley malt aroma with a touch of honeyVery sweet and sugary and a bit lthin and watery. Seems somewhat artificial. Low carbonation and short aftertaset.

Outer Banks Iron Binnacle Baltic Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Serving: Draft at the brewpub. It pours a very dark brown with a light tan head. The nose has a nice bit of smoked and roasted malt. The flavor is mildly sweet and woody with some smoke, a little scotch, and alcohol. Very mild mannered flavor wise. The alcohol becomes a little obvious as it warms. It lacks some of the darker roasted notes I associate with the style. Medium to rich body with an oily mouthfeel. Not bad.
Outer Banks Iron Binnacle Baltic Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Growler shared by Dogbrick. Clear light brown pour with a big tan head. Malty and caramelly aroma, and smells more like a bock. Caramel malt flavor with sugar and lager yeast. Now that I�ve read the description for a Baltic Porter, I guess this is a good representation.
Outer Banks Iron Binnacle Baltic Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"Growler courtesy of a traveling colleague. The beer pours a dark brown-amber color with a medium thin light beige head that recedes steadily. Stringy lacing on the glass. Roasted malt, yeast and touches of fruit in the nose. Medium, dry body with flavors of dark fruit, yeast and malt. Bits of dark chocolate as well. The finish is roasty and yeasty with a mild chocolate coffee aftertaste. Interesting (more traditional?) take on the style, and it�s nice that they didn�t just slap the word ""Baltic"" where ""Imperial"" would have been more appropriate."
Outer Banks Iron Binnacle Baltic Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at brewery. Pours clear dark brown/mahogany with ruby highlights and a beige head that quick subsides. Has a light floral hoppy aroma with some muted cocoa, cola, and carob notes. Flavor balances hoppy with some fruity fig and raisin, cola, and juniper berry notes and a dry alcoholic finish. Medium bodied with low carbonation. This is very light for a baltic porter - both in color which is translucent and in body. However, it works quite well as a strong ale.
Outer Banks Iron Binnacle Baltic Porter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at the OBBS. Opaque walnut color with no head. The relatively heavy aroma greats you with roasted malts some dark fruit and some lightly sweet cola hints. Not a bad flavor (and somewhat meeting the commercial description) of nuts, raisons and hints of spiced chocolate. Unfortunately there is some kind of sickly sweetness that really distracts from the overall taste. The body is very creamy and full. I picked up a growler of this for a friend, as it seemed right up his alley. I�ll let you know what he thought (as he does not rate on line). Book_M_Dano said he opened the growler to have a glass one evening and before he knew it...he had finished the entire growler. Very good in his opinion (3.6-3.9).

Dark reddish brown pour with a filmy head, complex nose of roses, chocolate, and alcohol, but well balanced with peanuts, coffee, and baked bread. Good!
Outer Banks Sledgehammer Barley Wine;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at the OBBS. Served in a snifter. Tawny is a good color description for the color of his brew (though amber would be acceptable as well). Actually comes with a bit of a head and good looking carbonation (surprising for a BW). The aroma is lightly fruity (dark fruit) and malty sweet. There are some cotton candy hints and an underlying metallic sweetness. The flavor is enjoyable with wood, nuts, dates, roasted malt, alcohol, light caramel and chocolate hints at the finish. The mouth feel is mostly watery but it does strive for creamy. Lightly bitter finish. For an unrated, unheard of Barley Wine, I was most impressed. Good job OBBS.
McMenamins Miami Weiss;Portland, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught @ John Barleycorns: Golden in color, slight haze, small white head, fizzy, spotty lacing, fairly lively lacing. Pale oat aroma, soft grass, maybe a little musty. Pale wheat malts on the tongue, slight oat/hay. Fairly clean, some musty oat/hay aspects on the finish. Body and mouthfeel are moderate. Lingering grassy notes. Glad that it did not have any sulpher funk so common with the style, but otherwise fairly boring. Easy to drink tho.
McMenamins Commonwealth Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught @ John Barleycorns: Dark brown, nearly black, moderate beige head, very little lacing. &nbsp Good roasted malt nose, barnish, slight coffee and milk sugar. &nbsp Dry bittersweet chocolate on the tongue, among the roasted malts and coffee. &nbsp Picks up sweetness towards the end. &nbsp A little thin for a robust Porter, but its what I expected. &nbsp Yet another fairly decent example that I think most would expect for yer average American Porter. &nbsp Fairly solid, at least I enjoyed it.
McMenamins Commonwealth Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On nitro tap at the John Barleycorn�s McMenamins.Pours dark chocolate brown with a smooth tan head.

McMenamins Vanilla Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at Pub Portland OR. Pours out a nice black topped with a off white head. I love the vanilla and sweet chocolate on this one. Not over the top on the vanilla. Just the right amount. Well done.
McMenamins Vanilla Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Enjoyed a pint of this one on draught at the Detention Bar at McMenamins Kennedy School, in Portland, OR. This beer pours to a jet black color, with a soapy white head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is just wonderful, with excellent aromas of vanilla, paired with hints of chocolate, and light roast. The palate is soft on the tongue, with good dark chocolate, coffee, and sweet vanilla flavors. This beer finishes with more good chocolate and light roast up front, then ends with a light warming, vanilla flavor that lingers. Really a well done beer that was just a delicious pint. This beer would have worked well with a desert, or even a good cigar at the Detention Bar. Worth seeking out if you can find it at a number of McMenamins locations.
McMenamins Vanilla Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Beaverton McMenamins.

Nose is light and floral with mild honey-like notes in the background.

Big Time Perspective IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Hazy golden coloured body with a hint of some orange glows and a nice proper two centimetre tall white head. Aroma of nice citrusey and piney hops with a good malt nose and a little yeast as well. Medium-bodied; Fresh hop flavour with a good balance of malt and some sweetness from caster sugar on the tail end, but the hops end piney and a bit floral. Aftertaste shows a nice subtle hop flavour, but more malts are noticeable than from before. Overall, a solid IPA with less of a focus on the big hops, and more on the balance - which works well! I sampled this pint on draught, while shopping for more beer, at Bottleworks in Seattle, Washington for US$4.00 on 10-February-2013."
Big Time Perspective IPA;Seattle, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Time Brewery;"Cask at the brewpub, 6% ABV, 8-4-8-5-17=42 Hazy golden color, with typical cask head, frothy, very persistent. The aroma is less powerful but more delicate than in the draught one, with nice fruitiness, yellow stone fruits. The mouthfeel is greatly improved, being smooth, and allowing the toffee flavor and malt to shine completely; the hopping is strong and delicate at the same time, perfectly complementing the malts. Balanced final. Lovely. Draught at the brewpub, 6% ABV, 8-4-7-5-16=40 Cloudy golden to light amber color; creamy head. Lovely aroma of fruity hops, citrusy. The body is lean, it has a very good toffee flavor, the hopping is perfect, powerful but not oppressive, with plenty of hop resins and bitter orange character. Fresh and excellent."

Samuel Adams 1790 Root Beer Brew;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Boston Beer Company;"From Jul 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a hazy reddish gold with a medium sized head of foam that shrunk slowly and stayed for the entire *session. The smell has a very rich root beer nose. The taste is big on root beer and licorice but there's a more dominant bitter/pungent flavour there that's taking my taste buds to somewhere I really don't want them to go. *In fact, I cannot finish the bottle....oh well. Bottom line: Not my ""cup of tea"" and something I cannot recommend."

BJ's Summertime Saison;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Multiple samples, GABF 2006. Head is fully diminishing.

BJ's Summertime Saison;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;"Beer Engine/Cask-Conditioned: Huge banana aroma - almost too much - with an overall impression of butter that is turning; intensely funky. Appears a crystal clear, light golden color, with no head whatsoever. Flavor is of overpowering fermenting cantaloupe; maybe a bit too funky. Palate is pretty flat and kind of mushy. Overall, this beer was in very poor condition. I believe my sample was from the end of the cask, and that the cask was past its prime. That being said, I enter this rating, because I do not believe this beer will be available again."
BJ's Summertime Saison;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;"I agree with fordest. This is the best beer I have ever had at BJ�s, and a damn fine ale in it�s own right. I have actually grown quite an affection for BJ�s, in that I think their beer is quality stuff. Granted, they need to get a little more imaginative (How about an IPA guys?), but for what it is, BJ�s makes quality beers. Plus, they have quite an extensive list of belgian bottles. Now, this stuff, which the waitress kept describing as ""summerfest"" is actually somewhat similar to a white beer. I actually remember drinking it saying, ""whoa, this is better than Hoegaarden"" but there is lots of corriander and other spices which make it probably fall into the category of a saison. But, at any rate, it�s a fine summer beer, and I could see myself drinking it everyday. It�s on tap right now....go check it out."
BJ's Summertime Saison;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Draft at Oxnard BJs. Golden color with a decent white head.

Lucky Labrador Single Hop IPA - Simcoe;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;On Nitro at the Hawthorne location. Very smooth from the nitro tap with a bright sharp bitterness. Simcoe is a great hop, and the citrus and grapefruit flavors were nice, but on Nitro it made the finish to sharp for me. Very well built IPA that had a nice caramel malt base and poured bright gold and perfectly clear.
Lucky Labrador Single Hop IPA - Simcoe;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;Half pint tasted at the LL Beer Hall in Portland, OR. Earthy, slightly roasted aroma with some floral hints along with some slight metallic aromas. Pleasant enough. Transparent copper color with a small whitish head. Wow--pleanty of hops in theis. Quite hempy flavor from the start, turning more bitter with grapefruity bitterness to finish. There is a nice balance of sweet and roasty maltiness in the middle to complement the Simcoe hops. Nicely balanced, very well-made single hop IPA.

Pours cloudy lemon flesh yellow with a sticky, rocky white head and sticky, patchy lacing. Aroma is yeast (dough, earth), malt (hay, straw), grass and a light fruitiness (citrus). Medium bitterness, mild sweetness, heavy yeast, malt, sour and tart hop, floral. Medium bodied and smooth palate.
Zero Gravity Bob White;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Pours a hazy yellow colour with a small white cap. Orange nose with other citrus like lemons and hints of coriander. The taste is kind of soapy with the citrus and spices in the background, but all very mild. The mouthfeel is a little tarty. A little too light, a little too thick - which makes it not really refreshing like the witbiers I like. Maybe too watery in the taste and feel.
Zero Gravity Bob White;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;12oz can. Pours light gold with a medium white head. Aroma is coriander, orange peel, and wheat. Taste is spice, coriander, wheat, pepper, orange peel, and slight banana. Light-medium body. High carbonation. Crisp mouthfeel.
Zero Gravity Bob White;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Can front brewfest beverage. Opaque pale orange with small head and a little lace. Lemony lime orange coriander aroma with some honey vanilla malt. Sweet bread vanilla and fruity wheat tang with medium light lemongrass spicy bitterness that lingers longer than required. Medium body is heavier than I like in style. Creamy mouthfeel. Good but Newburyport white will still be my go to this summer I guess.

Zero Gravity Bob White;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Cask at the brewery, 7/5/15 Hazy orange yellow color with a small, fizzy head. Belgian yeast aroma, lime adds a nice component. Can�t taste the mint at all, but it has an herbal freshness, so maybe that�s the reason. Pretty refreshing. Smooth, lightly dry.
Zero Gravity Bob White;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Hazy straw color. Slight fruity ester with banana. Taste is light and fruity with a good wheat flavor. Stays on the pallet just long enough.

Zero Gravity Bob White;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;In short: A nourishing and refreshing spicy wheat ale. Enjoyable How: Tap at brewpub, batch advertised at 5.4% The look: Cloudy yellow body topped by a large white head with good retention In long: Strong nose of bananas with cloves and light notes of coriander. From the aroma this smelled more like a spicy german hefe than the Belgian wit it is supposed to be. Taste packs a lot of wheat (this is not a water wit), mild spiciness (cloves, coriander), bananas, some oranges, light citric hops presence. Really full body but never heavy, very drinkable as it should be. Nice beer from a brewpub that also makes my favorite north-american pizza. I�d go there to drink beer and eat pizza every day if I could. I am really addicted to not quitting things that are bad for me.

Blue Ridge (SC) Rye Pale Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);Served from tap into a standard pint. Poured a nice red-orange color with minimal white head. It had very nice lacing throughout. The aroma consisted of mild hops. The flavor was of light hops with an organic rye flavor mixed in. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was an okay brew. I would compare it to your typical light beer only with a nicer hoppy/rye flavor to it. It is crazy how drinkable this one is though.

Blue Ridge (SC) Rye Pale Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);On tap at the pub in Greenville: Another copper colored brew.

Blue Ridge (SC) Rye Pale Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);draught. Pours a cloudy dark copper with a peristent white head. Aroma is very, very bready with distinct fresh yeast. Some zesty grapefruit and other citrus are present. The flavor is quite malty with loads of dinstinct rye which combined with the fairly assertive hops, culminates in a rather dry finish. This is clean and well balanced. I�d say the rye stands out more here than any other beer I�ve had, maybe due to the lack of deep complexity.
Blue Ridge (SC) Rye Pale Ale;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blue Ridge Brewing Co. (SC);On tap at the brewpub in downtown Greenville. Has the same house aroma as the ESB, kind of a musty feet smell. Light copper appearance, slightly sparkling, solid white head. Some citrsusy notes in the flavor, some mintiness. Not bad at all. Clean mouthfeel, goes down much smoother than the ESB.

Lech Lite;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Rated: 22. 06.2007 Bottle green, 500 ml Appearance: Low carbonation, head is foamy, quickly disappearing, rather no lacing, colour of the body is very weak yellow, colour of wee, piss, hardly rare I experienced such a pale beer. Aroma: Poor, drain water, some malts and very gentle hoppy skunkness. That strenght itself due to the warning of the beer, it because stinky due to green bottle. The mixture of this skunkness and carbonated nose gives the impression of stinking oil at the gas station. Flavour: Very wattery, like Lech Premium together with water, palate is non- existant, no finish, flat at finish, some very weak malty aroma and skunky hops, giving no bitterness, the strongest point of it is water, good beer for a hot day, less skunky than Lech Premium. A little taste of something sour, maybe citrusy but only a hint or impression. Palate: Practically non existant.
Lech Lite;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Medium white head quickly disappears. Pale yellow body with carbonation. Light apple aroma with mealy, perfumy notes.

Head is very nice, off-white, frothy to creamy with wonderfull lacing, regula head, long lasting. The head is lasting till the end of the beer. Aroma: Bad balanced, you can feel some notes of egg because of bad blend of tap water with burned caramel. Aroma is of blood! but nice! A bit flowery, rather gentle, creamy, all in all not repulsive but also not of a best, ink notes. Flavour: Accidic, bitter on palate, salty, you can feel carbonation, you can recognize ale in this beer, chalky, a hint of hops and nice caramel as for an ale is not sophisticated but interesting but and lacking nothing of the most important asprcts of ale. A kind of dark bitter, strong ale of a noticable burned, bitter caramel. Palate: Finish is medium to long, nice bitterness on palate, texture is accidic, bitter, wattery but a bit creamy.

When ozujsko called me to try these, he mentioned that I should really come and check out one of them. He kept any info about it from me, to surprise me. And man, was I surprised. This poured a beautiful emerald green colour. Yes, green colour. Beautiful too. And no, it�s not from food colouring (another surprise), it�s achieved through...err..... I forgot. Something about young hops and emulsion. I�ll let ozujsko explain it. All in all, I guess the green is from chlorophyll. Now that�s a first. Glad to see at least one brewpub around these and those parts not going for the ""unfiltered pale / unfiltered dark / mix of those two / and if you�re REALLY lucky a wheat"" approach. Anyway, back to the beer. It was apparently better fresh, but this was ok like this too. Almost no traces of the head (maybe some white remains), but this beauty didn�t need it. The green looks just so damn perfect. The nose... hmm... some grass and a touch of malt. Nothing too special. The taste is a bit grainy/bready and hoppy, a bit grassy (in a positive way) and lemony, with a long bitter aftertaste. Like the dark, this is a bit watery, but pleasant. From what I�ve heard, it was a lot better fresh, with the hops running the show nicely, and I hope to try this again."

Astarbe Sagardo Naturala;Astigarraga, Guip�zcoa, Spain;Apple Cider;Astarbe Sagardoak;In short: A superior Sidra, bright, funky, complex. How: Served from a bottle at one of the countless pintxo bar in San Sebastian Spain that are not listed on ratebeer. (this one was called Ttvn-Ttvn Taberna) The look: Cloudy yellow body with no head to speak of. To me a typical Sidra is: Funky aroma of medium intensity with many light color fruits in the back (not just apples). Body is medium in size, a texture that is both juicy and doughy and with minimal carbonation. Taste is a lot less apple-forward than a regular cider with apples but also various light color tropical/citrus/exotic fruits. Yeast presence accompanied by a bready sensation. Typical Sidras have a mild sourness and ends with a mild-medium acidic bite. Thirst quenching and also a bit nourishing. This one: Stronger and brighter farmhouse character. Fruitinees is much more like peaches and bananas than apples. Overall greater complexity. One of my favorite Sidra. If the planet ever run out of beer I think I�ll switch to Sidra, and if the planet run out of alcohol I think I�ll try this sex thing I�ve been hearing about.

Ottos Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;A complex strong tasting stout with character. Smoky is the dominant trait, then chocolate but there are hints of oak, vanilla, spice and rum. A bit murky and muddy for my taste. Not an elegant nose. Not sweet. Perhaps a pirate's stout but not especially for me!
Ottos Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask. Black pour with a long lasting brown head. Smells like chocolate and booze. Creamy palate, full bodied, quite a smoky finish. Lots of milky and roasted flavours, some sweetness, a decent impy.

Rock Bottom Arlington Bat out of Helles;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Rock Bottom Arlington;Draft... ODBF2006... Clear, straw-colored lager with a small, creamy, white head. The nose is grainy and a touch citrusy. Perfectly-balanced, well-bittered flavor. Medium-bodied with fizzy carbonation.

Very pale clear golden with a white head. Some light grass in the aroma. Flavor has notes of light grain, grass and a tinge of lemon/citrus. Light in flavor, moderate bitterness at the end.

Vermont Pub SomersAlt;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Draught pint at the brewpub. Pours a surprisingly light golden-amber color, relatively clear with faint haze, lasting smallish creamy head....spicy, noble-hopped aroma, juniper and carroway and lots of caramel, faint nutty-seedy quality....mouthfeel is rather light for the style, but not at all weak, with strong rye character at the front shading nicely into a deep malty sweetness midpalate, then drying out for some crisp spiciness and grassy notes at the finish. All in all a fine addition to the lineup.
Glenwood Canyon Storm King Dunkel Lager;Glenwood Springs, Colorado, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Glenwood Canyon Brewing Company;On draft at the brewpub in Glenwood Springs.

The Tap Doublelips Imperial I.P.A.;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Growler courtesy of maniac. Medium amber, clear, decent creamy head. Aroma was a load of pine. Flavor was pine with some faint biscuit malts. Not complex, but not bad either.

Sweet pine and citrus hop aroma with a caramel background. Sweet pine and citrus hops flavor with a mild caramel background and a floral flavor coming through in the ending.

The Tap Doublelips Imperial I.P.A.;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Draft at the Tap - 10% ABV - Dark copper, creamy light tan head (great lacing left behind). Hoppy aromatics lead with a huge pine and spruce blast. Warming brings out softer notes of white grapefruit zest that rides a sweet toffee and nutty earth backbone. Concentrated hop flavor is laced with fresh pine, spruce, and hints of citrus. Pulls out nice balance as the bitterness gains a light sweet caramel malt in the end. Full bodied, medium carbonation, warming, bittersweet finish. Loved this sippin brew...
The Tap Doublelips Imperial I.P.A.;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Tap. P ours a golden orange with not much head. Nose is hoppy, but they are not free to roam. The flavor is a lovely balance of hops and malt with a viscous, sticky, sweetness. I thought that Leatherlips had more unruly hops than this twice the lips. This was delicious, sweet, fruity, and with a great hoppiness in the back.
The Tap Doublelips Imperial I.P.A.;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;[growler samples at the Steve Bernard farewell tour] Thick, dense hop aroma. Slightly earthy and sweet. Golden copper color. Caramel malt flavors, with a powerful hop foundation. Sweet floral citrus initially, then the hops turn more earthy, with a rather dry finish. An awesome brew, overall.
The Tap Doublelips Imperial I.P.A.;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;12oz glass @ The Tap. Good aroma, sweet. Caramel, orange, buttescotch, earthy, florally (that doesn�t look right). Cloudy orangy brown color, small but thick head that stayed most of the way. Good lacing. Bittersweet flavor. Like aroma though I get a citrus/astringent bite to it that I see others did not. Maybe that�s the cask factor. Medium body, syrupy creamy mouthfeel, bitterdry finish. Nice, though a tad sharp maybe. Well worth the trip.
The Tap Doublelips Imperial I.P.A.;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Cask pint, freshly tapped on 6/19/06 at Redbones. Medium-high clarity shows very good brightness from the outset. Cherry-red with some auburn and darker ruby hues is the body, complemented by a large, mostly well-retained off-white head that provides light lacing in patches. The beer seems a little bit colder than I would expect, as the cask must have just been pulled from the keg room. Some light carbonation seems added, as they do at Redbones sometimes. Anyways, ripe hop acids, deep leafiness and mountains of fruitiness rush forth, bursting with cherry, orange and lively, sweet pears. Green, dense, chewy, acidic hoppiness is immediately at odds with dark caramel and heavily sweet pale malt sugars in the nose. Some prickly bits of grass and flowers, and really nothing in semblance of pine or heavy citrus, thankfully (for my tastes). But acidic and very hickory-nut skin-like. Pungent, I suppose. No alcohol in the nose, with a medium to medium-high strength. The flavor is not as malty as suggested, which is odd, but the high amount of hop bitterness and acidity seen in the leatherlips translates well here, cutting the caramel malts and sugary notes, with a very deep, green, thick, almost cannabis-like buddiness. I use all of these stupid descriptors not to be cute, but because it�s quite unique to my tastes and very different from your average Double IPA. Certainly no California DIPA, and hardly resemblant to any others I�ve had anywhere. But well-malted, quite tight in the mouth for a cask beer and with plenty of chewiness from the malt on the finish, perhaps a bit too much. The residual sugar makes itself known more in mouthfeel than in sweet flavor and the hop notes are very robust and engaging, without being terribly drying or crisp. Some toasty, earthy, almost English-like malts and light nutty yeast round out the beer, with no alcohol noted in flavor.
The Tap Doublelips Imperial I.P.A.;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Draught 10.5oz glass at Red Bones 6/17/06. Pours a cloudy copper color with a small foamy white head. Head lasts. Nose is light caramel malt, some floral hoppy notes with some light grass and earthy hops. Palate is thick and syrupy with a smoothness. Flavor is light caramel and lots of nice floral and earthy hop notes.
Wentworth Great Grimoire;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Porter;Wentworth;Cask at the Beverley Inn, Doncaster. Dark brown colour, some ruby, thin beige head. Aroma is very malty, maybe some hops, some alcohol in there, and some raspberry. Taste is much of the same, maybe some more forest fruits. Finish is very very bitter, dry and very long. Very good ale, but a little too heavy for too many of these. My 100th beer!
Wentworth Great Grimoire;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Porter;Wentworth;Cask conditioned at The Turf Tavern, Oxford. Dark brown to balck with cream head. Some beers defy definition, this seemed to be a cross between a Porter and a stout, a little thinnish on the tongue, but full of chocolaty dark malts, maLty biscuit with a dry bitter finish. Fruitiness in the body and on the nose. A good if slightly confuse beer.
Shugborough Wills 1st Brew;Shugborough, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shugborough (Titanic);Cask conditioned at The White Horse, Oxford. Cloudy orange with no head. Heady vinegar apple nose with a raw appley fruity body. Absolutetly awful and the Landlady, they have been in charge 3 weeks now, would not change it. Probably the worst beer I have been served in a very long time, shame on them.

Munro Dry Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle- Pours transparent yellow/gold. The nose is of toned down honey and white wine and hints at grass and gooseberry. Tastes of slightly sweet honey with floral and grassy components, leading to mineral and white wine. Nice, comparatively dry finish when considering the other meads they make. Certainly the most approachable of the bunch, though I liked all of them so far.
Munro Dry Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Clear w/ yellowish hue. Dry, fruity white wine aroma. Medium, somewhat oily feel. Wine-like flavour w/ mild notes of honey. Dry, slightly medicinal finish.

Munro Dry Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle shared with a bunch of folks at Doug�s - courtesy of tupalev. Very pale golden. Warm, boozy nose with a hint og fruity sweetness. Light wine flavour with a hint of honey in the finish. Bit more flavour than the regular version, and a milder finish - but it still doesn�t wow me.
Munro Dry Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle. Pretty much looks like water with a slight yellow tinge and no head. Some sugar and reasonably fruity aroma. Cake-ish, cookie-like flavours with a lot of alcohol heft. I like this better than the last couple as it was much drier and more flavourful. The alcohol really shines through which cuts the drinkability overall.
Munro Dry Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Item #5 at June 2006 Toronto cider/mead -fest - bottle from tupalev. Almost clear (had a yellow tinge), flat and oily-looking. Light boozy-sweet aroma, vague honey, wine and fruit. Taste is the same - really tries to be fruity, winds up just watery - but at least it�s not boozy and harsh than their regular mead - a little sticky, but easy to drink.
Munro Dry Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;My bottle mail order direct from the meadery, held in my cellar for 4 months before Doug�s tasting. Very light, no head. Fruity aroma. Dry taste, much more flavourful than the regular mead. Very fruity finish. More like a wine than a mead. Ok.
Munro Dry Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Very pale yellow body. Very light citrus in the aroma may be imaginary. Wine like honey aroma. Light flavour with light notes of fruit and honey. Average palate.
Munro Sweet Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Pours a pale golden. Aroma is sweet honey, and waxy earthy comb. Flavor is wonderfully sweet upfront without being overly so. Nice notes of Apple and hints of comb wax. Medium in body, smooth with no alcohol burn. A nice drinking mead.
Munro Sweet Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Pale, transparent yellow with sticky legs after the swirl. Nose is honey and sugars with apple and other fruit aromas. Very sweet honey taste is mingled with apple white grapes, with a slight floral component. Thick, oily, sweet, balanced with nice acidity. A great sipper for after a meal.
Munro Sweet Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Clear w/ a light yellow hue. Aroma of sweet honey & alcohol. Sticky feel. Very sweet flavour that borders on cloying but never quite gets there. Some notes of honeydew & cantaloupe also evident.

Munro Sweet Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle shared with a bunch of folks at Doug�s - courtesy of tupalev. Light golden-yellow. Mild aroma of slightly fermented honey. Flavour of honey, quite sweet without being cloying. Alcohol in the background, but well balanced by the sweetness. Definately the best of their three unflavoured meads.
Munro Sweet Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle. Pours a clear, yellowish, dull body. The nose is typically honey and minerals. Mild fruit flavour and crazily sweet - sticky and smooth oiliness. Not too easy to drink but the alcohol is well masked.
Munro Sweet Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Item #6 at June 2006 Toronto cider/mead -fest - bottle from tupalev. Pale flat yellow. Sweet, alcoholic, bitter aroma, some tart fruit too. Taste - sweet! OMG this is sweet, honey, alcohol, generic fruitiness - sticky and flat with a quick finish. It�s okay, but oh jeebus this is sweet.
Munro Sweet Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle, just maybe my favourite of the 6 Munro meads. Light yellow, no head. Nice very sweet honey aroma. Very nice sweet honey taste. Not cloying, but fresh. Nice alcohol burn in the finish, noticeably stronger than the mead and the dry mead. Excellent, this is more like it Munro!
Munro Sweet Mead;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Pale yellow body. Sweet alcoholic aroma with light sweet honey and fruit. Light honey, melon? muted tropical fruit. Average to medium palate. (3+) A little more rounded that the dry and regular.
Munro Raspberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Rose wine coloured, pink still liquid. Nose is of fresh raspberry and honey with other beery notes seeming to come through. Tastes of sweet raspberry jam and watermelon with loads of sweet honey. Quite syrupy and thick on the finish, very sweet. I�d suggest having this one as an after dinner treat. A full glass on its own is a bit much seemingly.
Munro Raspberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Clear reddish brown. Aroma of raspberry jam & dark honey. Medium, syrupy feel. Unbalanced raspberry syrup flavour w/ notes of honey & alcohol.
Munro Raspberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Smells like raspberry Kool-aide, deep pink, tastes of honey, too sweet, fine. A big Thank You to tupalev for allowing us to sample the entire lineup from this meadery!
Munro Raspberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle shared with a bunch of folks at Doug�s - courtesy of tupalev. Deep pink colour. Aroma of honey, melon and berry. Sweet honey and tart raspberry melds nicely in the flavour. Simple, but enjoyable.
Munro Raspberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle. Pours a reddish-pink-brown body with no head. The aroma is pillowy, dusty raspberries, cherry cake, and even some chocolate. Juicy body and it�s quite sweet again leading to an almost syrup-like texture. The sweetness lingers and becomes almost rough after a while. Decent overall. Finally...finished the series.
Munro Raspberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle at our cider/mead tasting at Doug�s. Decent honey, alcohol, raspberry aroma. Really nice raspberry/honey taste - lovely. Easily my second favourite of the Munro�s. Excellent.
Munro Raspberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Dark pink to red body. Sweet honey, alcohol and raspberry in the aroma. Fair bit of dry raspberry over the usual honey and alcohol mead flavours. Average to medium palate (3+). Easily the best of their fruit meads.
Munro Blueberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Clear, slightly pink liquid, that leaves some legging after the swirl. Nose is honey and grass up front, some fruit, though not big on blueberry. Tastes of sweet honey and sugary fruit, though, again not blueberry. Floral flavours linger and the honey provides a sweet finish that is matched up with some mineral nuances. Warming and boozey, but enjoyable.
Munro Blueberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Ever-so-slightly hazy amber w/ a light reddish hue. Very faint aroma of honey & fruit (blueberry I suppose). Light, syrupy feel. Harsh, unbalanced alcohol laden flavour.
Munro Blueberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Honey nose, but no blueberry, light pink, taste more like black cherries than blueberry. Strong alcohol, quite sweet. Fine. Thanks tupalev.
Munro Blueberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle shared with a bunch of folks at Doug�s - courtesy of tupalev. Light copper colour. Mild, sweet aroma with vague berry notes. Not much blueberry in the flavour, it�s more like a thin, sweet, generic fruit wine. Disappointing to a blueberry fan like me.
Munro Blueberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Bottle. Pours a pale orange-reddish body with no head. Some fruity tartness in the aroma along with apple dust. Quite sweet again in the flavour and it�s a bit dusty and fruity - funny how there isn�t a whole lot of blueberry character overall. The alcohol is warming but not overwhelming. Decent.
Munro Blueberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Item #10 at June 2006 Toronto cider/mead -fest - bottle from tupalev. Poured clear pink, flat-looking. Aroma quite tart and alcoholic, plenty of bitter fruit but nothing I could identify as blueberry. Taste was the same - alcoholic, generic syrupy tart fruit with a bitter finish - very sweet and sticky, pretty flat - nothing really wrong here, but it had a harshly sweet boozy aftertaste.
Munro Blueberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;My bottle at our cider/mead tasting at Doug�s. Mild sweet aroma but no blueberry to speak of. Clear, copper. Nice dry blueberry skin like taste, but that�s stretching. Nice, no blueberry, but sweet and enjoyable.
Munro Blueberry Melomel;Alvinston, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Munro Meadery;Golden body witha light pinkish tint. Sweet alcoholic aroma with very light fruit. Light sweet generic fruit with honey and alcohol background. Virtually no blueberry presence which is disappointing. Average to medium palate.

Some cranberry tones in terms of tartness and astringency. Light coffee. Medium mouth. Deftly done, the best beer of the 9 or so they had on tap this go round.
Big Buck Scotch Ale;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Big Buck Brewery;As far as a scotch ale goes, I like mine much more smokey, roasted, malty, dark and sweet. This beer was outstanding in almost none of these catergories. I could barely distinguish this beer from the amber. Reddish brown color that is somewhat hazy and has no lacing. Nose is matly and sweet. Taste is woody, caramel and grapes but very muted. Not impressed but I will say at 7.2 this is very drinkable.

Produced an ale with a dark golden brown body with light carbonation, topped with a small white head of foam. Little aroma, but could detect some sweetness and malt later in the sitting.

Flyers Pacemaker Porter;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;Porter;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;"6oz at brewery. Very dark brown, almost black. Tan head, sticks around. Very roasted porter. Can easily be called a stout. Mild acidity and roast/fume is followed by a light ""dry stout"" like finish. Leaves a dry, lightly malt bitter, fumey finish. I could use a less roasted version."

Aroma brings out toasted malt, some dry cocoa and a touch of dry coffee. Flavour is quite nice, with roasted and toasted malt, some dry cocoa and again a touch of coffee. Quite flavourful and robust. Easily the best of Flyer�s mainstay beers.
Flyers Pacemaker Porter;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;Porter;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Thick and robust goodness from Flyers. Haven�t had in years now, but would definitely go for one if I saw it on tap up in tha 206!
Flyers Pacemaker Porter;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;Porter;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at brewpub Black color with small creamy brown head. Very similar to the Brown Ale, just a bit bolder and more chocolatey, but the roasted malt and coffee dominate, and this is more Stout than Porter.
Flyers Pacemaker Porter;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;Porter;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;bottle at Ft Wayne tasting, Sept 2013 - Pours very dark brown and smells of roast malt and coffee. The flavor is much the same and in a good way. It�s full flavored and full bodied, a straightforward porter with a pleasantly lingering roasted finish that�s overall quite enjoyable.
Baron Dampfbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Pale bronze color with a light head. Very yeasty flavor and moderate yeasty aroma..
Baron Dampfbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Tried at SIB. Honey and corn/light grains is what I get out of this. Really light. OK, but nothing to seek out.
Baron Dampfbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Cloudy dull beige colour. Very fruity aroma (banana, mango) with a little spice. Soft body, oily and undercarbonated. Doughy, lightly toasty malts. Some fruitiness but no malt character. This is dull and lifeless. But it�s one of those things - you experiment enough times and you�ll miss once in a while.
Harmon JT Memorial Kolsch;Tacoma, Washington, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;"Hazy dull blonde. Light breezy pale malts in the aroma. Flavour is quite heavy on the underattenuated pale malts and stodgy continental hops. Taken as a generic golden ale, it�s heavy and simplistic; taken as a kolsch, oh boy..."
Harmon Braveheart Bier;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;WA Cask Beer Fest �06. Pours amber. Aroma is earthy malt and some spice. Taste is slightly watery with good balance of malt and spice.
Harmon Braveheart Bier;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;"On tap at brewpub. One of the most unique beers I�ve ever tasted. First thing I said after tasting: ""I think there is curry in this; no, actually it�s chili powder."" This is a heather beer, brewed with heather and no hops. No chili powder or curry added....but the heather gives it an amazing ""earthy"" taste...not dirt, but a deep mushroom like earthy taste. Very unique and worth trying. Not worth drinking a lot of."
Harmon Braveheart Bier;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;Bronze-brass color w. no head. Woody and earthy aroma. Very unique earthy flavor with a piquant prickliness.
Harmon Braveheart Bier;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;Hazy amber, little or no head.Only one thing to say about this, wood shaving in both nose and taste, nothing else. Smell reminds me of a pencil sharpener. This is crap!! The worst beer at the fathers day festival
Harmon Braveheart Bier;Tacoma, Washington, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Harmon Brewery & Restaurant;This has to be the strangest heather ale I�ve ever tasted...hazy caramel colour. Toasty, spicy aroma is fairly assertive, at least until you take a sip and get the explosive flavour. Massive spices...not at all the sweet, flowery heather you�d expect but wood, cumin and fire-roasted chiles (sans heat, of course), roasted corn on the cob. They�ve used some sort of herbal bitterning agent in stead of hops and it�s quite woody.
BJ's Razz-Fusion;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Cask sample at the �06 Real Ale Fest. This was a raspberry beer aged in some sort of barrel - wish I had kept my beer sheet. Sweet grain and raspberry extract aroma. Crappy flavor - wet grain, tart raspberry, sweet wonderbread. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty nasty stuff, 5oz was too much.
Scuttlebutt Mermaid Tears Spiced Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;I thought I recognized the smell/taste as chamomile, and the brewer confirmed it for me.Overpowering and unbalanced.
Scuttlebutt Mermaid Tears Spiced Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Scuttlebutt Brewing Co.;Hazy blonde colour. Slight footy, musty yeast aroma. On the palate, though, it�s hugely spicy, with loads of cinnamon. Totally unbalanced, overloaded with powdered spices.
Big Horn Hop King IPA;Lakewood, Washington, United States;IPA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Ram Puyallup�s Hop King IPA has a cloudy amber appearance. The aroma has a wonderfully refreshing, breezy, citrusy character. Moderate bitterness has a similarly fruity, citrusy, refreshing bent, with light balanced pale malts. One of the most thirst-quenching IPAs I�ve found in a while, perfect for summertime.
Valhalla Island Bere;Unst, Shetland, Scotland;Traditional Ale - Other;Valhalla Brewery;From bottle at Bird Observatory, Fair Isle, 15.05.18. Clear pale mahogany. Persistent beige head and lacing. Aroma and taste of burnt circuitboards, medium dark malt and bark.
Boulder Beer Scotch Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Boulder Beer Company;Draught. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, caramel, nuts, chocolate), lightly hoppy (flowers). Flavor is heavily sweet. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic. I certainly expected some sweetness based on style and strength, but it�s overboard and thus hard to consume much of. Pleasant if simple aroma, but couldn�t even finish a small glass.
Boulder Beer Bitter Native;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boulder Beer Company;Draught. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is medium amber. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, resin), lightly yeasty (dough). Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation. As with a large majority of BBC�s brews, it�s too sweet. Even when served way too cold in the ridiculous frosted mugs. Pretty ok aroma though, albeit American in hop style.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Old Fugget Barleywine;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Draft notes from the brewpub. Hazy brownish pour with minimal off-white head. Nose was a complex medley of bourbon, cognac, caramel, vanilla, hops, and fruit. Hefty on the palate, witha reigned in heat but still apparent, with notes of bourbon, vanilla, hops, earth, peat, and a finish that got more spirited as it warmed.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Old Fugget Barleywine;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On cask at the brewpub. 2010. Warm boozy nose of bourbon, malt and ale alcohol. I love the amalgamated aroma that comes from a barrel-aged barleywine, it�s so distinct, unique and enjoyable. This one comes with an extra twinge of hops. Pours a well-hazed and slightly cloudy ruddy amber with plenty of ultra-fine off-white cask head. Flavors are rich, but to me surprisingly full of fresh hop flavor and potent bitterness. Snappy malts play off of the sinous bourbon warmth and a creamy sensation, then a strong rise of bristling, dry parched hop cone character. It gets a little dusty in the backend. I thought this was solid, but that it would actually be a bit more palatable with less hop character and some more of the sumptuous pale malt character that�s so expressive in the base beer. Somehow, this got a touch out of balance.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Old Fugget Barleywine;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Had on cask. Very mellow due to cask but that�s not a bad thing. Bourbon and lots of malt flavors that work very nicely together. Very smooth as well. Overall a very balanced beer which I believe was due to the cask.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Old Fugget Barleywine;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Otto's Pub and Brewery;From the handpump. Very, very strong aroma. Can smell the bourbon a mile away. Very pleasant smell. Looks are a dark amber with thin head. Taste is very strong. Heavy notes of alcohol. Has some kick too it but very smooth. Long lingering taste of alcohol. Perfect for a long cold night or after dinner drink. Charlie has made a very fine barley wine. Cheers!
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Old Fugget Barleywine;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Served from a beer engine. Attractive amber-copper body with a lasting, silky beige head. Aroma of sweet maple, brown sugar, vanilla, cognac, and light smoke and earth. Sweet, deep malty flavor with well-matched bourbon characters. A huge, decadent, and tasty beer.

Midnight Sun Saison of the Sun;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Thanks to goldtwins for sharing - very hazy glowing golden beer - aroma of oranges, earthiness, soft herbal character, moderate sweetness - the flavor starts out with moderate citrus/orange marmalade sweetness, followed by strong herbal tones, then some dry, peppery qualities - fairly yeasty - kind of sweet for the style, and not as complex as I was hoping.

Midnight Sun Saison of the Sun;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy golden light copper- a bit dull with a fizzy head. Aroma is yeasty- smokey phenolics bordering on medicinal, coconut- pina colada- pineapple fruitiness, with a spicy cardamon and other harsh phenols. Light bready malt underneath a bit of a mess with phenols, yeast, hops, spices, smoke- cobwebby old person home- dusty and rank- oxidation is also apparent. Dry dusty and lame body and finish.

Texas SUX Beer;Krebs, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Krebs Brewing Company / Pete's Place / Choc Beer;"Aroma actually has some pronounced floral hoppiness, but is also fairly sugary; some cereal malts somewhere in there. Appearance is nasty swamp water/diarrhea color, but with a pretty frothy white head. Flavor... there�s just something deeply wrong with this beer; I didn�t vomit, so it gets a 2. Palate would require another mouthfull of this concoction, so I�ll pass. Sorry, Oklahoma- perhaps I will get a proper beer from your noble land one day."

Texas SUX Beer;Krebs, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Krebs Brewing Company / Pete's Place / Choc Beer;Look, if you�re drinking a novelty beer like this, you pretty much know what you�re going to get, and this one is just want you�d think. Pours a cloudy yellow with thin white head that dissipates quickly. Light aroma of sweet bread. Flavor is corn syrup, grain and a touch of citrus hop. Slightly fuller bodied than your usual crappy lager, so it�s got that going for it. But this beer really has no redeeming value.

Texas SUX Beer;Krebs, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Krebs Brewing Company / Pete's Place / Choc Beer;Appearance: Pours a lightly hazy, yellowish body with a thinnish, white head. Smell: Very faint maltiness and light whiffs of corn as well as some curious, cautioning notes of expired lemonade. Taste: Light pale maltiness stirred up with corn kernels and light corn syrup sweetness. Slight, displeasing spritz of sour lemon. Altogether mild hop character and bitterness. For the touch of dirtiness present, it finishes mercifully clean. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Drinkability: Indeed, something sux here, though I�m not sure if it�s Texas. Contract brewed by Pete�s Place, a brewery where most of the brews seem a bit off. It�s one of those rare times when I�d rather just have a lager from one of the macro breweries.

Crabtree Twisted Creek Wheat;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Crabtree Brewing Company;It poured a dark gold color with a white head. The aroma was of wheat, some banana and a touch of spice. The taste was light bodied and crisp with flavors of wheat and light fruitiness.

Crabtree Twisted Creek Wheat;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Crabtree Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a deep cheddar orange with a nose of burnt toast copper and buttery leaves. Flavor is toasted leaves, light biscuit, and dehydrated rose. Average mouthfeel. Blah.
Crabtree Twisted Creek Wheat;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Crabtree Brewing Company;This is a solid wheat and one of the best beers from Crabtree. Has the typical wheat appearance and body, but the taste and aroma are somewhat unique. The flavor is defined by wheat, but there is an interesting sweetness, part banana, part citrus fruit that keep you coming back. Great summer beer.
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;06Aug2019 Dark toasted malts, toasted bread, burnt straw, chocolate. Slightly hazy brown, no head.

Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;From May 2007 Purchased from Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins. This one pours from 22oz bottle a clear dark amber with a very small head of foam that dissipated completely before I finished typing this sentence and there's no lacing. The smell is very delicate..I can't get much out of it...maybe some sweet malt? Really faint. The taste is at least more assertive than the nose. I can taste some roasted malt with *some* nutiness but it's pretty lightly flavoured. I'm also getting some chocolate notes and some spice..swishing the beer in my mouth, I'd say there was some cinnamon flavour there but, again, it's on the light side. The finish is kind of a hodgepodge...slightly bitter but not bitter in a *good* way. Man, this isn't very good at all. Could be a drain pour for me. Dang. Further sips in and there really are no redeeming features in this brew. I *am* going to pour this down the drain.:^(
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pour is murky brown with a frothy tan head and good lacing. Butter, caramel, earthy hops, grass, bread, and toffee in the aroma. Taste is coffee, bitter hops, butterscotch, caramel, weird off-flavors, and cocoa. Medium body with medium carbonation. Extremely flawed.
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;Has a sample at the brewery. The aroma is soft brettanomyces character, nutty, cherry. The flavor indicates a brettanomyces character as well. There are notes of nuts, roasted malts, caramel. Not bad, not sure if the brettanomyces is intentional, but it works.
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;Looks and smells a little wispy. Finish is roasty, but starts off a little weird. Pretty ok
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;Tap @ Crabtree. Pours a dark orange appearance with a khaki head. Nutty, toasted caramel marke malty, somewhat spicy aroma. Tangy fruity, lightly acetic (huh?), caramel flavor. Drinkable but has some issues.
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;Brown pour with light brown head...metallic malty aroma...taste us cocoa abd malts..some nut..not bad
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;Pour is a dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma is slight roast and not much else. Flavor is about the same. A slight roasted malt is all I�m getting. Watery after that. They made a boring brown ale even more boring.
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;28th May 2011 Hazy red - brown beer, tiny white head. Dry and crispy palate. Caramel chocolate in the malt. On top is a lively plummy fruit. Minerals. Dry and slightly bitter finish. An interesting brown, but a tad over dry.
Crabtree Boxcar Brown;Greeley, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Crabtree Brewing Company;Pours a clear amber-brown with a half finger of diminishing eggshell head. Aromas of malts, caramel, toffee, and dough. Flavor is sweet and mild up front, then slightly bitter. Finishes nutty with tones of roasted malt and hints of toffee/dark chocolate.

Deepness fade away.
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);looks like it�s supposed to. dark brown, some red. opaque. smell is definitely brandy and oak. i can�t believe i�ve never had this. this is pretty awesome, but i can�t really describe anything unusual about it. it�s pretty much just a perfect oaked barleywine.
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draught at the Wrigleyville location. Hazy brown color with a thin white head and orange edges. Wild aroma of alcohol, soy, molasses, and dried cherry. More dried fruit came out in the flavor (cherry and fig) along with soy and a warm splash of alcohol. Not the best barley wine I�ve had, but decent.
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);#921On Tap at the Goose Island Wriglyville Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beers November 4th, 2006. Hazy murky amber with a thin tan brown head that is short lasting. nose is sweet and woody with some major hints of smoke. Taste is very sweet suggary with (vanilla?) and mroe and more brandy with sharp lashing fruits and pepper. Good.
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Milky, hazed mahogany in color with a jaundiced tan wrung and celestial khaki brown colored swirls for the head. Balanced, gentleman�s aroma reveals rhubarb, stiff Thanksgiving pie crust, and black raspberries over oats that eventually get slathered as a salve on dark roasted, rain-saturated barn house planks. Plum sauce in a dried out eggplant shells is left open to the sun�s aromatic persuasion. Holistic flavor is extremely enjoyable. Smooth yet fiery coexistence yields a flavorful fabric cotton freshness at the tip of the tongue. Thick juice slides in with some crisped pomegranate skin. Buttered plum juice and brandy cream sauce beautifully balance the full-bodied flavor and mouth feel. Saucy maple sugar gets swirled into dulce de leche cake batter with a hint of rum, and somehow makes the successful transition into beer. Candied English buttered rum toffee lozenges join a subtle, cottony bing cherry trait, hanging on the cusp of each sip and swirling into a pool of sticky caramel that�s growing harder by the minute. Brandy butter sees us out.
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A pleasant surprize from GI, since I wasn�t a big fan of their Old Aberration that was a base for this. The nose is sweet and fruity with toffee and butterscotch. Very smooth drinking, it tastes of toffee, dark dried fruits, alcohol, a splash of chocolate, some smokey wood, and a quiet earthy bitterness. All of this is blended well into one drinkable barleywine. Festival of Barrel Aged Beers, Chicago, IL 11/04/2006
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);FoBAB 2006. My second favorite barleywine of the day after FFF Behemouth. Notes of caramel and toffee on the nose lead into honey, walnut, date, and BUTTER! Just a bit of pleasant scratchiness on the throat that was odd and interesting. Impressive.
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at G.I. Clybourn. Poured a perfectly deep and complex hazy burgundy with a medium cap of dense chocolatey-beige head. There was a whole helluva lot going on in the nose here... deep plum sugars, brandied figs, semi-sweet chocolate, earth, a hint of lightly-burnt grilled cheese... Time and warmth brought smokey, spicy malts. Loved it! Flavor wasn�t far behind... sporting a smoky, fruity choco-toffee-spice-a-hol base with some earthy malts... alcohol became strong toward the bottom, but the brew maintained its composure. Brandy, plums, and spices graced the finish. Smooth and calculated across the palate with an old ale feel to it. Great stuff!
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Without a doubt the best of the Goose Islands that I have had; interesting, because Barleywine is among my least favorite styles. Almost blakc with a tan head. Nose of sweet dried fruit. Taste of sweet toffee, dried fruit, spice, alcohol, brandy, and spices. Good full mouthfeel, less cloying than the sweetness would suggest. Despite the alcohol and warmth, none of the alcohol burn or unbalanced bubblegum that I usually associate with a barleywine, possibly because this one is well hopped. I�m not sure it�s really a 4.1 but maybe; it�s as good as I�ve had from Goose Island."
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Darught, Clybourn: dark reddish-brown...fairly opaque with a touch of off-tan cream on top. Wonderful aroma of sweet, citrusy hops, black cherry skins, and plumy alcohol. The palate is super sticky and a bit too sweet for me. I was expecting the flavours to be harsh, but this ended up without the full flavours the original Abberation had. Orange bitterness and sweet caramel alcohol are at the end of a quick finish. The araom is the best part of this one!
Goose Island Brandywine;Chicago, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. This bad boy pours a dark blood red mahogony with almost no head. The aroma is dominated by sweet butterscotch and caramel with some dark fruits frolicking in the background. The taste is plenty sweet but not unpleasant and the bitter hops of Old Aberration are still around albeit much more understated. Finishes warm.

Southern Tier Big Red;Lakewood, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);9.2% ABV: I liked this one. Could use a little more malt. Light red appearance. Has some DIPA characteristics, or something like one of those hybrids. Citrus and pine hops, etc. Still finding Lagunitas better though, for about 2/3 the price....or even half if you get their 6-packs.
Southern Tier Big Red;Lakewood, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);It has a deep reddish/orange amber body with a slight haze. On top is a creamy egg shell white colored head, which is about two fingers tall and quickly settles to a thin covering. This small cap of foam hangs on well and makes lots of spotty and slick lace patterns on the glass. The aroma has loads of caramel maltiness and sweet bready notes with a solid backing of perfume like citrusy hops. There is a good solid load of bready and caramel like maltiness with a very slight hint of bitter chocolate. Right up there on the tongue with the malt base are the hops which bring solid bitterness and floral and spicy citrus flavor. The palate has smooth slightly slick but well carbonated feel and the finish has a slow hop bitter fade.

Southern Tier Big Red;Lakewood, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Back from retirement in time for me to get a bomber from Liz. Pours hazy dark amber with a slight creamy beige head. Aroma is herbal with sweet malt. Spicy - but not in the Belgian yeast sense. Full bodied. Foamy carb. Flavor is sweet malt with a lot of herbal hop. Not grassy. Or maybe it�s earthy. Definitely not grassy. Makes me think of a heavily hopped pilsner where the malt ran amuck. Finishes on the non-dry side, but the flavor combination is so tasty that I don�t mind. Great beer.
Southern Tier Big Red;Lakewood, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Better than I thought it would be. Orange colour. Malty bready aroma. Taste is kind of hoppy. A combo between an IPA and a red ale. Quite good.
Southern Tier Big Red;Lakewood, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle @ home, courtesy of jcnielsen. Thanks Jetson! Hazy dark orange appearance with a fairly small, cream colored head. Rich caramel malty, somewhat boozy, toffee, very rich, spicy, herbal, a bit hoppy aroma. Rich, boozy, toffee flavor with a lot of spicy hops and some notes of flowers and soap. Probably a bit old but this is too strong. Like some other Southern Tier brews, this has not held up at all.

Sixpoint Apollo Wheat;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Hazy to cloudy amber color with a tallish, wispy off-white head. Initial scent give the impression of bleu cheese. Wheat, orange zest, and over-ripe bananas work their way into the mix. Full fell for a hefe. Sweet start that is matched by a mild acidity mid quaff. Some banana and light spice also squeeze in. Not much depth, but certainly not a Kristall. Hits somewhere between a decent hefe and an American wheat. 3/12
Sixpoint Apollo Wheat;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);"Rated based on notes taken 1 Jun 2013 -- A really enjoyable brew. Mouthfeel is a little creamy, malts and hops make a delicious sipper or chugger; your preference."

Sixpoint Apollo Wheat;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);From notes. Tasted on 6/30/12 at the 1st Annual Chimipalooza, from can. Pours clear orange with an average white head that leaves just a thin collar of lace. The nose is wheat malt with some banana and tons of orange peel. The flavor is the same with the lightly sweet wheat malt and banana up front moving to the orange peel that is showing some bitterness. The body is light with average carbonation and a long orange peel finish. Clean and good example of the style.
Sixpoint Apollo Wheat;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);Transfer from BA review on 10-8-12- Poured from can into pint glass Appearance � The beer pours from the can as a lightly hazed golden orange color with a one finger white head. The head fades very fast to give only a tiny level of lacing. Smell � The aroma is heaviest of wheat and sour lemon. Mixed with these aromas are some lighter notes of yeast and a malty smell. Taste � The taste starts out of wheat and malt and is quite lemony. The lemon taste gets even stronger as the taste moves on. As the taste moves on with the lemon increasing in the flavor becomes more and more tart. In the end a rather mouth-puckering lemon and wheat flavor are left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer is on the light side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly above average side. Good for the style as it balances out some of the tart flavors by not allowing them overpower the tongue but yet the feel yields to a more refreshing feel. Overall � A bit on the tart side for me, but that is to be expected for the style. Not a bad flavor profile and rather refreshing.
Sixpoint Apollo Wheat;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Sixpoint Brewery (ABV);What the hell? I randomly had my second kristallweizen without realizing it. Citrus and a little bread yeast. Light banana. Pours golden with ok head and lacing. Tap at Black Squirrel.

Appearance: Pours pale golden, clear in texture body with moderate carbonation, head is very pure snowy white practically brisky, medium in size, no lacing. Aroma: Artificial awful citric accid with extreme artificial sweetness and pronounced, dominating gelatine odour frequently found in generic, poor quality baking powders, rather should be called �Green Lame� not �Green Lime�, chemical, reminding of toxic waste or washing powder mixing with cheap soap. Flavour: Not that absurdally sweet as �Freeq Red Fruits�, lime, citric accid and gelatine, more soft but not refreshing at all, even kind of earthy rotten potato notes or maybe it violated my sencess so much?

Big Time Better Off Red Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Time Brewery;On ask. Dark amber colour with minimal head. Caramel sweet malt aroma withsome light hops. A touch of spice before getting sweet and malty before drying up with the hops.
Big Time Better Off Red Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Time Brewery;"Draft at the Barking Dog. Gorgeous dark brown with a sudsy off-white head. Looks like a big heavy complex ale. The aroma is fairly common dark ale--sweet malt, some citric hop, just a hint of the nut/sour wheat. The flavor of this pour varies from the at-the-brewery notes a bit. The hops overpowered. The Northwest red style is confusing to me; too many seem to be just color variations on an IPA. Not that I would grade this any higher if it were called an IPA; the body�s a little too heavy to deliver that refreshing IPA crispness. This one�s lost in space for my money, and I can�t remember having seen that from Big Time before. Bless �em, though, for trying new things."
Big Time Better Off Red Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Time Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pours a surprisingly deep brown with red highlights and a limited head. Hints of lemony hops, lots of cola malts, turning rather malt-heavy, almost burnt, as one gets into the flavor profile of each sip. The hops never come back to hold their own, and the beer - slightly overcarbonated for my taste - disappoints given the high expectations I tend to hold for this brewery.
Big Time Better Off Red Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Big Time Brewery;Rating # 200!! Tasted side by side with the dry hop cask version. Not quite as complex as the dry hopped version, as would be expected. Nice malty sweetness, but not much hop presence. The dry hopping really brings out the taste in this one.

He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.;Clifton Park, New York, United States;IPA - Rye;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Cloudy dark amber pour, finger of tan head. Nose is carmel and rye. Middle is chewy carmel up front, spicy rye, woody hops, oily mouthfeel. Finish is sweet and thick. The ABV is lurking and starts to show as this warms up.
He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.;Clifton Park, New York, United States;IPA - Rye;Shmaltz Brewing Company;One fine DIPA! Very well balanced. Sometimes rye beers are overly sweet, but this works nicely. Not the hoppiest DIPA, but sometimes I like it that way. It's about the maltiness on this one....although there's a decent hop finish at the end. Appearance is on the gold/copper side with a bit of a red hue. Some pine and citrus in the aroma. Will probably buy a 4-pack of this since I only bought one 12 oz. to sample first.
He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.;Clifton Park, New York, United States;IPA - Rye;Shmaltz Brewing Company;12floz bottle, no date (I don't think this is the freshest), $1.75 unit cost, nonic glass. Appears a halfway opaque amber with a one finger head. Aroma is of rose, caramel, some fruitiness, and nail polish remover. This beer is fine, and as I recall it being more so when I know I had it fresh in the past. The hops are subdued here, which this DIPA has always been maltier than others in the style, but still. Tastes like jammy biscuits, full, rich, and sweet.
He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.;Clifton Park, New York, United States;IPA - Rye;Shmaltz Brewing Company;From Oct 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with nutbown. Thanks Alan! This pours a deep amber gold with a small head of foam. Again, there's lots of lacing like the others I've tried from them. The smell is both hoppy and malty. Good notes of caramel and light floral hops with a rather strong peppery presence. My nose is happy. The taste is stronger than the smell when it comes to the hops. Floral and piney hops dominate with a strong pepper spice flavour and a mild caramel malt backbone that I wish was more assertive. Dang, this is spicy and it makes me take long breaks between the sips. The alcohol is also more assertive than I care for and not nearly as well hidden as in their Jewbelation 11. The mouthfeel is medium and nice, the carbonation is medium, and it finishes very bitter with some sweet tones though, I can't say that it's anywhere near balanced. Bottom line: This one just doesn't do it for me and finishing the bomber will be a chore. Too much hop bitterness and pepper spice for the amount of malt that I can taste. Too extreme for me? I think so.
He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.;Clifton Park, New York, United States;IPA - Rye;Shmaltz Brewing Company;"On tap and 12-oz bottle. My all-time personal favorite. No kidding about the ""obscene amount of malt and hops."" Big rich round full-bodied full-throttle delicious brew."
He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.;Clifton Park, New York, United States;IPA - Rye;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Deep copper amber, persistent off white head and lacing.

He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.;Clifton Park, New York, United States;IPA - Rye;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Tasted from the bottle, bought in Cincinnati at my local Jewish deli. Oy vey! This is a solid brew! I was happy to be a circumcised man of god when I put this rye IPA to my orthodox lips. Surely a goy couldn't handle this beer, it's as strong as Abraham, and as fertile as the lords good soil. The flavor on my tongue was hefty malts and fruity hops with just a hint of rye whisky. Let gods chosen people rejoice, Shmaltz has done it again! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
He'Brew Bittersweet Lenny's R.I.P.A.;Clifton Park, New York, United States;IPA - Rye;Shmaltz Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours dark amber with tall, long lasting, fluffy off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of caramel malt, citrusy hops and ripe fruit. Body is full and slightly crisp.

Samuel Adams Traditional Ginger Honey Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Boston Beer Company;Bottle split at RB Best Encomium share, Santa Rosa, 30/01/16 - Many Thanks ! Hazed golden orange with a moderate off white covering. Nose is orange peel, ginger, wood must, light spice. Taste comprises toasted grains, honey, floral notes, musty, light spice, oxidised trace. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, semi drying close. Pretty much as I'd expected ... aging probably hasn't done too much damage!
Samuel Adams Traditional Ginger Honey Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Boston Beer Company;"From Jul 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a hazy light gold with a large head of foam that dissipated slowly leaving about a 1/4"" layer for the entire session. The smell has a pungent nose to it along with some earthiness. The taste has a honey sweet flavour mixed with a ginger tartness that is *definitely* different...for me, it's a bit *too* different from what I expect in a beer. I'm not going to slam Sam Adams for coming out with this traditional brew, I'll just say that in this case, it's not for me."
Samuel Adams Traditional Ginger Honey Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Boston Beer Company;Golden with a fizzy head. Smells of spices, clove with a little caramel.

Samuel Adams Traditional Ginger Honey Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Boston Beer Company;12 oz. bottle in the hotel lobby after the RB Best Awards. Thanks to whoever brought these four old Sam Adams - never expected to see them, as they must be just about exctinct in the wild by now. Pours a barely cloudy gold with a head that only amounts to a small ring. Plenty of ginger left, with honey, tea, lemon, grass, and a faint toasted malt. Light-bodied, with low carbonation and a sweet, smooth, tea-like mouthfeel. I�m sure this was much better a decade ago, but the remnants still add up to something interesting.

Samuel Adams Traditional Ginger Honey Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Boston Beer Company;An interesting beer.....light, fresh aroma of ginger and honey, along with some lemon. Flavor is primarily ginger, but the sweetness of the honey is detectable, as is the malt and lemon, but that is more in the background. Quite carbonated. A unique brew that is not altogether unpleasant.

Alround rating: Marzipan(subtle), nutty, very carbopnated, cherry is key, not overly sweet but very thin. The light aspect seems to have taken the sugar and body out of the beer.

Distinct aroma of cherry sauce and almonds. Light body, a somewhat artificial sweetness and then again these very distinct notes of cherry sauce. No bitterness.

Monte Carlo Belgian Wit;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;This one was served with an orange. Had the standard Belgian White aroma and flavor. For some reason I remember this reminding me of Blue Moon. I remember this being nice and pleasant although I prefer my beer to be served without fruit.
Monte Carlo Belgian Wit;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Smells wheaty. Faint color. Taste is pretty dry throughout, so the wheat isn�t too much. A pretty decent beer of the style.
Monte Carlo Belgian Wit;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;On tap at the Monte Carlo and served with a lemon wedge. Golden straw color with a white head and a nose of orange, apricot and soap. Lots of curaco orange peel with peach and apricot fruit flavors. Mostly orange with some soft spices. It was tastey but clumsy for a wit.
Monte Carlo Belgian Wit;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Tap, Monte Carlo. Fairly clear golden color. Sweet yeasty aroma with hints of peach. Sweet slightly grainy flavor. Alot of spiciness with a sweet fruity flavor.
Monte Carlo Belgian Wit;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;"Draught @ The Brewpub: My first Monte Carlo pint at this brewpub inside the hotel. This was their ""Brewmaster�s Special"" on my visit so I figured I should try it while I could. Poured excellent with a cloudy yellow body, brown edging, and a foamy head of perfect size. Aroma rich in wheat, lemon, and orange that oddly lost potency the warmer it got. Taste is strong at first, heavy in yeast and citrus. It pales a bit as it warms and adds an odd nuttiness. All told it�s a bit of a citrus-heavy bland flavour for the style, but not at all offensive. A good effort."
Monte Carlo Belgian Wit;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;On tap @ Monte Carlo poured a clear pale yellow with a small dissapating white head. Aromas of wheat, coriander and light citrus. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of wheat, coriander and light citrus with a crisp lightly sweet finish.
Monte Carlo Belgian Wit;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Monte Carlo Brewpub at the Monte Carlo Casino;Hazy light gold in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of grainy wheat, coriander, flowers, and a bit of chlorine. Very lemony flavor, along with an interesting lactic sour vs. slightly sweet thing. Medium bodied... but more like its underattenuated as opposed to wheaty thick. Overall, it�s a fairly middle of the road wit. Perhaps a bit too straightforward and lacking in a bit of the funky yeastiness of its Belgian counterparts.
Lauterbacher Kristall Weisse;Lauterbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Privatbrauerei Lauterbach L. Ehnle;Pours a gold yellow color with small white head. Aroma is a sweet sour banana, orange, clove and wheat malt. Test of 24.08.2008.

Lauterbacher Kristall Weisse;Lauterbach, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Privatbrauerei Lauterbach L. Ehnle;Bottle. A clear, golden beer with a too small, off-white head. Not small, just too small. The aroma has banana, some caramel, notes of hops and spicyness. Flavor-wise it is the pale malt and banana that dominates, but there�s also spicyness, and it finishes quite estery. Watery and quenching. Decent beer, refreshing, but I sure prefer the hefe�s.

Buntingford Captain Cuttle;Royston, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Buntingford Brewery;Cask Handpump at The Wellington, Birmingham. Red-brown appearance, with a short off-white head. Scent is very caramelly, with some citrus. Perfumed in the front of the mouth with bitter hops on the end. Slightly watery, but generally very good.
Derby Johns 65th Birthday Special;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Derby Brewing;Cask handpump at The Wellington, Birmingham. Slightly gold, but not much colour at all. Caramel and citrus in the scent, but the main thing to talk about is what this beer does in the mouth: The first thing one notices is how alive it is on the palate. Then one is hit but a very fruity-perfumed set of aromas in the front of the mouth before one notices the bitterness towards the back. After swallowing, the perfumed aromas return as an aftertaste. Good stuff!

B�rgerbr�u Hof Edel Pilsner;Hof, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Scherdel Hof (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Herb und dumpf startet das Bier, dessen Etikett mit den wahrlos gezeichneten Schn�rkeln nicht gerade zu den sch�nsten z�hlt.

Outer Banks Vikings Liking Light;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at the brewpub. Clear bright golden in color with a smallish white head. The aroma is of pale malt, light smokiness, and juniper. Interesting flavor, rather light and mild with pale malt and bready notes but with a good smokiness and a touch of juniper. Medium-bodied with average carbonation. Enjoyable brew.
Outer Banks Vikings Liking Light;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Draft. Very good overall -- different with a complex taste and flavors - some spices and floral. Light and refreshing, cloudy yellow with a light head. Would have again.
Outer Banks Vikings Liking Light;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at the brewery. Mango. The mango flavor and nose stands out, but it was supposedly flavored with Juniper. Very drinkable, and a good beer for those non-beer drinkers out there.
Outer Banks Vikings Liking Light;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Had this one on draught in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina. Outstanding! Medium yellow and clear with effervescence, mango and pink lemonade in the nose, and a delicious fruitiness with notes of gin. Amazing!
Eichhorn Festbier;Forchheim, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Eichhorn Forchheim;Tap at Annafest Forchheim in a stone Masskrug - quite bland for a Festbier. Some cardboard, high carbonation. weak malts. left me quite disappointed.

Eichhorn Festbier;Forchheim, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Eichhorn Forchheim;Bottle. Clear golden color with small white head. Aroma is green apples, straw, cardboard. Taste is green apples, cardboard, paper. Low carbonation, mineralic finish. Very, very unimpressive.
Eichhorn Festbier;Forchheim, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Eichhorn Forchheim;Clear golden with little white head. Aroma is green apple, chalky herbs, some toasty malts. Taste is fruity sweetness, some chalky sour stuff. Medium finish, medium heavy, not so drinkable. Still ok.
Eichhorn Festbier;Forchheim, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Eichhorn Forchheim;Bottle. Bright red-tinted gold, with some wispy foam seeping up out of full body and low carbonation. Sweeitsh, nutty-malt smell edged with caramel and hint of zest. Rich, nutty, malty sweetness met by a pretty firm and welcome bitterness, some orange-fruit flavor in there too. Really a lovely, full-flavored, bittersweet lagerbier.
Eichhorn Festbier;Forchheim, Bavaria, Germany;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Eichhorn Forchheim;Draft at keller: Pleasant aroma of lemony Spalter, toasted hay, flowers, and a touch of mineral. Soft and snug carbonation. Initially snappy with light minerals coupled with a crisply defined punch of nutty toffee-kissed Munich malt fused with haylike pils. Vague kiss of woody Spalt pokes through, as does a hint of licorice. Fruity esters offer dense slickness while the minerals and light tastiness delicately scratch at the tongue. Quiet lemony oiliness accentuates the nicely layered malt. Well-integrated maltcentric finish features toasted bread and a bouncy fusion of pecan and honeyed hay. Perhaps a bit straightforward, but it�s mostly clean and exhibits proper balance.
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);A fairly insipid lager designed to take some of Corona (with a slice of lime) and also Smirnoff Ice market share. The taste is typically sweet Fosters lager with a synthetic lime and lemon after-taste. It�s not unpleasant, just bland. It�s very easy to drink and not too strong so makes a good session beer.
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Fairly bad citrus spin-off from what is already a terrible tasting lager beer.
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Bottle 33 cl. Pours a clear golden with a white head. Lightly sweet malt with a twist of lemon in the nose. Medium body, odd bonbon accents, some brewing cereal and cardboard. Rather tart lemon accents. Ends dry - almost astringent. 160110
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Is there any point in this beer? It�s a fairly common trick to put a lime in some poor lager to disguise the stale nastiness of the experience, but substituting the lime with an odd, artificial lemon/lime flavour is just bizaare. Taste is pretty much standard musty grain lager, and some bitterness from the lemon/lime but no freshness.
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Bottle 33cl. Clear glass. Clear light yellow color with a small to average, fizzy, fair lacing, mostly diminishing, white head. Aroma is moderate malty, grain, toasted, cardboard, light hoppy, lemon. Flavor is moderate to light light heavy sweet and light bitter with a average duration. Body is light to medium, texture is watery, carbonation is soft. [20081231]
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Clear with no carbonation. Not a lot of body just a kind of sickly citrus taste. A novelty beer and not a very good one at that.My first Fosters rating and hopefully the last for a long a long time.
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Bottled. An anaemic hazy and very fizzy diluted urine coloured beer. The aroma is plastic. The taste is chemical with hints of lime. Harsh nasty flavours. Only useful in a heatwave.
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Lemony pissy watery acidic. Better than the normal Foster�s though. maybe for a really hot day and big thirst
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);Bottled(330ml). -Malty, lemony and corny with soft carbonation and sourish finish. Crap.
Fosters Twist;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Royal (Heineken UK);330ml bottle @ Cardinal (sampled from someone else�s bottle, not the kind of beer to purchase when visiting Cardinal). Golden body with a foamy white head. Aroma is to much citrus/lime and no beer. Flavor is not balanced at all, its sticky, sour and vapid. Rather thin body and not much reminding of beer at all.
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;Bottle - pours dark brown with a tan head - nose and taste of molasses, licorice and sweet chocolate - lighter medium body
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;Bottle split at RB Best Encomium share, Santa Rosa, 30/01/16 - Many Thanks ! Light black with a decent tan swirl. Nose is toffee, spice, oxidised notes, light roast. Taste comprises dark fruit rinds, spice, soy sauce, toffee, light cocoa, brown bread. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close. Has lasted fairly well for a 5% aged porter.
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;"From Jul 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a dark brown with a huge tanish head of foam that shrunk over a few minutes but stayed as long as the beer was in my glass. The smell is really sweet...molasses dominates my nose. The taste is black licorice and molasses to the nth degree and I'm *not* a fan of black licorice. I mean, I can taste some sweetness from the malt but that's way overpowered by the 2 flavours I mentioned. Not my kind of Porter at all and I'm wondering right now if I'll be able to finish the contents in my glass. Bottom line: I'm glad Sam Adams is constantly experimenting with new beers and when you do that, there's bound to be some misses. I'll take *that* chance as long as SA wants to. ;^)"
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;Darkish brown pour. Aromas of roasted malts with a little chocolate. Flavor is kinda mellow compared to other porters. Starts roasty and finishes with a little mocha.
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;12 oz. bottle shared by someone in the hotel lobby after the RB Best Awards. Thanks! Never thought I�d see these four pop up. This one pours a cloudy brown with a small khaki head that settles into a ring. Notes of tobacco, black olives, earth, and chocolate. And plenty of cardboard and dead leaves. Light-bodied, with low carbonation and an oxidized, earthy mouthfeel. Rotted, but I bet this was once a fine porter.
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;[1/30/16] Bottle sample at the Encomium bottle share, after RateBeer Best awards ceremony at Hyatt Vineyard Creek Hotel in Santa Rosa. Thanks everyone who shared bottles! Dark brown. Oxidized, rotten fruity aroma, caramel, nuts. Sweet.
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;Bottle. Pours a clear brown with small beige head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is dark fruit and cardboard. Very oxidized, wood, raisin, nah.
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;"""this was another solid effort from the Sam Adams historic line of beers that i apparently just liked more than everyone else. stands out from other porters because of the licorice and molasses...i�ll buy if they make it again."""
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;24th July 2009 BBE Oct 06. Opaque dark brown beer. Crisp palate. Lots of bitter toffee and molasses and unsweet licorice. Finishes crisp with some carbonated bite and more unsweet licorice. Another unusual beer in the Patriot collection. Very drinkable and rich.
Samuel Adams George Washington Porter;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Boston Beer Company;bottle from stfun on 1/16/11 with a bb date of october 2006. not really sure why this was laying around and even less sure of why i wanted it in the first place! porter colored with a soft beige head. typical. odd aroma... vanilla, roast, lactose, molasses, raisins, vegetals (green peppers), sweaty yeast and card board. the flavor is the same only turned down a notch. there are also notes of dates, wood, herbaceous-ness and BTF iodophor. it is creamy and slick yet sharp. clearly it is past it�s prime... sadly, it is still better than a lot of fresh stuff on the market! 6/3/5/3/15
Samuel Adams James Madison Dark Wheat Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;It just feels out of place if you�re drinking it without a steak or onion rings.
Samuel Adams James Madison Dark Wheat Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;Bottle split at RB Best Encomium share, Santa Rosa, 30/01/16 - Many Thanks ! Dark mahogany brown with a decent light tan cap. Nose is light soap, dark fruit rinds, brown bread, light spice. Taste comprises dark malts, light yeast, clove, trace of oxidisation, peppery spice, toffee. Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close. Not too bad for the style ... age hasn't done much damage here.
Samuel Adams James Madison Dark Wheat Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;From Jul 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a hazy reddish brown with a huge head of foam that shrunk but stuck around from start to finish. The smell is on the subtle side for me. I note a sweetish malty nose and that's about it. The taste is quite sweet from the malt and there's some chocolate there too but a bit of a citrus bite in the background helps balance out the sweetness pretty well. Not a big beer taste wise but it is decent enough so I'd be tempted to try this one again if sold by itself.
Samuel Adams James Madison Dark Wheat Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;Pours a dark hazy brown color. Aromas of bread, malt, and some fruit. Flavor has a touch of sweet malt and clove, I think. Overall, not to bad.
Samuel Adams James Madison Dark Wheat Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;12 oz. bottle that I tried in the hotel lobby after the RB Best Awards - thanks to whoever brought these four long-retired Sam Adams treasures. Figured they were extinct. This one pours a cloudy amber with a small off-white head that settles into a ring. Notes of wheat, caramel, cardboard, tea, toast, and brown sugar. Light-bodied, with low carbonation and an oxidized, smooth mouthfeel. Not a ton of character left in this one, but I bet it was fine in its day.
Samuel Adams James Madison Dark Wheat Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;[1/30/16] Bottle sample at the Encomium bottle share, after RateBeer Best awards ceremony at Hyatt Vineyard Creek Hotel in Santa Rosa.

Gourmetbryggeriet Piney;Roskilde, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Gourmetbryggeriet (Harboe);Can, 50 cl. Clear light copper body with a bubbly white head that soon dissipates. Visible carbonation. Moderate malty aroma with a hint of caramel, but way too many metallic notes. Moderately malty and sweet taste with light bitterness and some acidity. Some vague hop flavours. Watery taste and mouthfeel. Light body with average carbonation. Dry, slightly astringent and unpleasant finish. Most of the bad beers I have been foolish enough to buy are simply dull and generic. This one, however, is bad. There is absolutely nothing to appreciate here, and the rest of it will be poured into the drain. According to the deScription, it has been brewed using Amarillo hops, and I am saddened by the thought of all the great IPAs that have not been made because of this waste.

Gourmetbryggeriet Piney;Roskilde, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Gourmetbryggeriet (Harboe);Top fermented beer with honest, persistent foam. It hangs nice on the inside of the glass and smells promising ofboth peach and orange. The flavor is only dominated by the hops (Amarillo), but the fruity and malt flavor mixes quickly and together form a very mellow taste. Carbonation is nice and bubbly and dots pleasant on the tongue, while the taste slowly fills the mouth. After taste is lengthy and also mellow.
Gourmetbryggeriet Piney;Roskilde, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Gourmetbryggeriet (Harboe);Copper color with grayish head. Aroma is of metal, pine, fruit, toffee and caramel. Taste is malty and bready, metal and piney hops. Decent!
Gourmetbryggeriet Piney;Roskilde, Denmark;Pale Ale - American / APA;Gourmetbryggeriet (Harboe);American Pale Ale is a bit of a stretch. Sure there�s Amarillo and it kinda smells like an APA. As far as taste and palate goes, this has to be one the more confusing brews I�ve ever tasted. Too dominant malts, way too easy on the single hops and it taste most of all like elderflower cordial with brown sugar thrown in for the fun of it. The harmony is all off. Head vanishes within ten seconds, and the beer feels somewhat oily and fat in your mouth, if you drink it at a decent temperature. Serve cold, and it�s drinkable. Pair it with a bowl of chili

De neus is zwak, ik kan er weinig uithalen maar mijn bier is nog te koud. De smaak begint honingzoet overgaand naar een lichte bitterheid, kruidigheid en droge afdronk. Matige sensatie. Alcohol komt minder tot uiting. Matige volmondigheid, medium carbonatie. Middelmatige sterke ale dus.

Shoreline Sum Nug IPA;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;IPA;Shoreline Brewery;Bomber pours a clear orange with small soapy white head but good lacing. Aroma is mostly floral hops. Taste is bitter and sometimes dank, with a bit of apricot malt and medicinal flavor in the middle before a bitter finish. Texture is watery with a medium body. I enjoyed this one more on tap with a good dinner at the brewery the first time than bottled at home.
Shoreline Sum Nug IPA;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;IPA;Shoreline Brewery;Hazy golden-amber color with a medium off-white head that recedes gradually. Partial rings of lacing on the glass.

Shoreline Sum Nug IPA;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;IPA;Shoreline Brewery;Bottle: Pours cloudy, orange-amber with a short beige head. Orange/tangerine scent. Creamy, sticky fruit flavour with a very strong, grassy hop bitter...malty... Pretty well done.
Shoreline Sum Nug IPA;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;IPA;Shoreline Brewery;Nice floral hop aroma and nice complex hops when it hits the tip of the tongue, but it went downhill from there. Once it got to the back of my mouth, all that was there were harsh bitter notes and quinine. Edit: I�m not sure if it was due to warming over my hour drinking the bomber or just acclimating to the beer, but it was significantly better at the end. A mild sweetness emerged that balanced the hop bitterness and made for a nice beer. I�m not sure it�s worth a bomber, but it�s a solid beer.
Shoreline Sum Nug IPA;Michigan City, Indiana, United States;IPA;Shoreline Brewery;This was courtesy of Strykzone. Thanks Dave. From the 22 oz bottle poured a copper color with and off-white head and good lacing. Nose of pine and citrus hops on caramel malts. Medium in body with a resinous mouth fee. Flavor is big on hops and moderately bitter. Finish dry, bitter, and flavorful. Good beer.

Capitol City Apricot IPA;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;Sampled on tap on 7/15/06 at the Capitol Hill location: Pours a clear golden bronze with a thin-lacing wispy white head. Fresh, fruity apricot aroma floats above a subtle crystal maltiness and some mild floral hops. Body starts with some crisp fruitiness turning more muddled and very buttery toward a dry finish. The fruit character is nice, but the buttery flavor has got to go.
Capitol City Apricot IPA;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;On tap at the Postal one of these pubs. Deep golden color with a sticky head. The nose is all apricot with a pleasant fresh fruit smell. Apricot dominates the flavor as well with the apricot sweetness balanced in the finish by a long hop bitterness. This is one of those fruit beers where the fruit feally just takes over the beer. If you like apricots, here�s one for you.
Capitol City Apricot IPA;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;Draft @ Capitol City Capitol Hill Amber color, thin head and nice lacing. Nose of apricot, bright and up front with a bit of citrusy hops complimenting it. The flavor is nearly overpowered with the fruit, a bit of malt shines through. Tart finish, a bit too much extract perhaps? Even apricots don�t taste this...apricotty.
Capitol City Apricot IPA;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Capitol City Brewing Company;A dark orange beer with a nice beige head.

District ChopHouse IPA;Washington, Washington DC, United States;IPA;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);Disappointed. Color too amber for an IPA that can be tasted with too much malt flavor.

John Harvards Manchester Hop Chronic IPA;Manchester, Connecticut, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Manchester;Pint on cask at Manchester, CT location. Sticky, caramelly malty aroma with subdued mild earthy hops present. Rather disappointing hop-less aroma. Mildly hazy amber-copper color with a frothy off-yellow head and gorgeous lacing. Dry, earthy hopped start, turning roasted and malty in the middle. Just a very mild amount of hempy hop flavor follows with a burnt popcorn diacetyl buttery finish. Yuck. Maybe I got overly spoiled with all the hempy IPAs in the PNW?

Rock Bottom King of Prussia Grand Cru;King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rock Bottom King of Prussia;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark golden, very cool! About an inch of head which sticks around a while leaving some lacing. It�s spot on for a Grand Cru, yeast, bread, slight orange/citrus tastes predominate. I have to say, it was a little thick and sweet for me. It could have been lighter in body and a tad bit dryer and it would have been out of the ball park. That being said, I really like this style and RB KOP really made a good one! Keep up the good work guys!

The pour was hazy dark straw colored, with some fruity aromas, such as pear, melon, and some hopcitrus. The flavor was malty and on the fruity sweet side up front, with notes of pear, melon, orange, berry, and some chardonnay palate feel. It tasted almost like a fruitier version of a maibock.

Stary Krakow Pale Ale;Krak�w, Poland;IPA;Browar Stary Krak�w (2005-2007);actually not brewed! I think, isn�t classical IPA, because small bitternes, and intensive fruits aroma locate this beer outside IPA style. thick gold ale tasty at the and of the brewtank.
Great Waters Stingo;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Yellow, corn-like color, slow moving carbonation, little head. The first whiff was butter, then lemongrass. Very muted spices in tehh flavor. A bit of mid-palate warmth from the ginger, and the a lightness that I didn�t predict from the visual carbonation. Refreshing in feel and the danger is going to far with such a recipe (too much ginger sucks)...but here it might be accused of not going far enough. A lemon-ginger mineral water? Not bad though. (on tap at brewpub)
Great Waters Stingo;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Clear yellow color with a thin head. Very strong lemongrass aroma and dang does it ever pour on strong in the taste! The wheat is just barely detectable and the ginger is completely buried by the lemongrass. A little floral hop is there. I like lemongrass and all, but the amount in this one tends to make it one dimensional. Still, it�s damn good as just a �lemongrass beer�.
Great Waters Stingo;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Waters Brewing;Hazy straw yellow in appearance. Spicy wheat aromas. Champagne, lemon meringue and butterscotch. Sparkly flavors like candied lemon, almond and dry wheat. Light bodied but packs a powerful flavor.
Great Waters Stingo;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Waters Brewing;"Lovely hazed golden look...big, fresh bone-white head...pretty in the glass. Spicy, wheaty aroma...I forgot for a moment that this is ""a wit with a twist""...heavy spice on top of refreshing wheat...ginger and lemongrass are used, they tell us, but it feels like more... Taste: brisk, refreshing, goes down with exceptional ease. Lemongrass is in there, citric taste, grassy texture, ginger spice sparkles. Just enough grit in the swallow for interest. Lightish body, long, citric. spicy finish. Delicate at heart, but substantial in flavor, and quite memorable. A unique accomplishment, a growler I�ll enjoy emptying. And I�ll make a note to stop into St. Paul more often if they keep making intriquing brews like this."
Great Waters Stingo;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Great Waters Brewing;"On-tap at the brewpub: Darkened lemon yellow color. Small, frothy white cap of dusty white foam sits briefly. Broken spotty lacing sticks across the glass. Aroma is a fairly rounded in lemony citrus and wheaty tang with a stirring of ginger spice added to the mix. Much like the �Skip and Go Naked�, minus the lemongrass, add the ginger. Not as much oatyness or bread tone to it though. Taste is about the same as the smell. Quite wheaty, fresh, snappy, with a milding dullness that keeps it under a decent control as the lemon tones are soothingly set. Ginger spice is evident and makes for a decent blend along the way. Highly herbal and kinda minty with a glossy leafyness in its ginger spice. Not all that captivating as the ginger is there with a presense thats not overbearing, but bearing enough for it to be a skad unbalanced. Fans of ginger will like it, those who don�t like ginger won�t like it. Feel is about a medium body; smooth, fresh, round, and tangy, with a certain lemony punch, and the mix of ginger to spice it up. Ginger beer is not my favorite, this ain�t half bad, the ginger presense is enough to either push or pull one in directions the palate may not enjoy all that much. Drinkability is drawn within the likeablity and tolerance of ginger as it tilts away from its wheaty base."
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;Pours amber with a nice off white head. Smells of caramel, spicy, earthy. Tastes full bodied and sweet with a nice spicy finish.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;2008 vintage unnumbered because they grabbed it out of the cellar at the brewery and gave it to me in September with the promise that I would let it age until Christmas. I kept my promise and it is my first beer of 2009. Just a really great amber ale. Malt and sugar play very heavy in the profile, but that is fine with my tastes. Hopefully with their bigger brewery they can brew this more often.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;2008 Vintage. Appearance: Pours a hazy, amber body with a thin, wispy, white head. Smell: Sweet-smelling, malt-driven aroma of caramel squares with accompanying fruit notes. Taste: Chewy caramel maltiness along with tastes of honey candy and sugar-crusted apricots and pears. There�s never much of a showing of hops or bitterness and they struggle to provide balance. Finishes as sweet and fruity as it began. Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A fine, malt-forward amber ale. So yeah, it�s worth a try.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;22oz bottle, Vintage 2008. Deep amber, off-white head. Aroma of sweet caramel, sugar, toffee. Floral nose, nice hop. Flavor of sweet malt. Very well balanced. Nice calming hop bitterness. I�d love to brew this one at home. Easy drinking.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;From a 22oz bottle - Pours a somewhat cloudy orange/red color with small quickly dissipating head. Below average carbonation. Smells super sweet with an excellent balance between the hops and malt. First sip is very mild but extremely tasty. Great and welcomed bitter finish. Medium light bodied. A very nice amber.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;Clear copper with white head. Aroma is somewhat perfumy and piney. Toffee-heavy flavor at first then comes notes of pine, some orange and a little wood. Ample bitterness. Robust/full-flavored. Full, round body with moderate carbonation. Solid.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;2008 bottling. 22oz bottle, purchased at the brewery. Pours deep amber, capped with a moderate-sized beige head. Aroma is primarily malt, with some grapefruit and caramel. Flavor is on the sweet side, with caramel malt and honey up front, which are gradually joined by piney hops. Hops linger on the palate. Very smooth mouthfeel. Not bad, but too sweet for my palate.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;2008 vintage 22 0z bomber poured into my pint glass produced a good two fingers worth of head that turned to a thick lace. The body of the brew was a great amber color. The aromas of hops were the first thing to hit me. Followed by a nice biscuits and caramel malts smell Flavors are toward the sweet side caramel malt is upfront but there is a slight bitter finish. Really more of a barley wine feel to this brew. A medium mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation The drinkability was good on this but the bomber was enough for one sitting. A little sweet for me.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;Great for long summer days. It�s light and better than mass produced American light beers.
Bar Harbor Special Amber Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;Pours from the 22 oz. bomber to a reddish orange, with thick off-white head that lingers well into the glass and leaves good lacing. Nose is malty sweet with a hint of hoppiness. Mouthfeel was of this full-bodied beeer was complex, almost bittersweet, as the malt and hops collided. Flavor was more of the same, and this all led to a long, pleasant finish. The unique thing I noticed about this beer was that unlike many qualitly beers that taste better as they warm, this was actually better served cooler (not ice cold). Still one of the more enjoyable ambers I�ve had.
Santa Barbara Picadilly Pale Ale;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;"(Draft: O�Brien�s in San Diego, CA) One pseudo-word comes to mind when drinking this: Meh� Right off the bat, I�m getting that vegetal aroma, not classic hops, not citrus, just plants. And this carries over into the flavor, but to a lesser extent. It�s mildly bitter with some citrusy hops in there sitting on the grainy malt base. Medium body, well, barely. Carbonation is a little less active than the ""typical"" beer. Dark golden color and moderately cloudy. Very small, off-white head is almost filmy when poured from the tap and fully dissipates quickly. Nothing interesting here to me, glad I didn�t order a full size pint."
Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;22oz bottle shared courtesy of Ughsmash (thanks for yet another beer off my wish list!). Poured a medium golden color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of some citrus, toasted grains, and some fruitiness. All on the softer side. Tastes of tropical fruits, caramel, toffee, and some citrus. The hops definitely mellowed out, but I�m glad I had the chance to try this one!
Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Bomber. Poured clear, bright lighter golden with a fluffy cap of off-white head. The aroma picked up sweet lighter fruits and toasted grains with dry floral and shadows of juicy grapefruit.. softer than expected and very well received. The flavor lost a lot of its hop power, but was still quite nice.. toffee and other paler malts surrounded by grapefruit, grassy, and pineapple bitterness that rose as the drink progressed.. finished bitter with some juicy remnants. Medium-bodied and increasingly bitter on the palate.. a little raw and a little past its prime, but still quite good.

Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;This DIPA screams at you from the glass. A fiery blood orange/red. Full of miniscule floaties and some stray carbonation bubbles. The head is thick, white, and coats the glass with sticky, resiny lacing. Overall retention is superb. Sweet citrus. Lemon, grapefruit, lime, hints of tangerine, and star fruit, with a nice touch of toffeed malt to integrate things a bit. Very sweet smelling hops somewhat floral. Man this is a great beer. Thick with resiny, citrus fruity hops that finish on the piney side. Grassy on the finish as well with toffee malt at the mid. Prickles the taste buds on entry and through the long finish. Very citrusy again but not much grapefruit in the mouth more led by tangerine and star fruit with a lemon/lime twist. Nicely carbonated, medium mouth. Drinkable as hell, no signs of alcohol. If anyone from Midnight Sun is reading this. Please start distribution in Ohio. Your beer is outstanding.
Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;"December �06 bomber drunk on 4/18/07 Large, foamy white head shows moderate retention, light lacing and tops a deep golden body with some peachy tints. Fine-bubbled carbonation rising sporadically. Deep simcoe nose shows tons of pine, though it�s not horribly acidic or bitter (there�s a punch to it though). Hop oils are quite fat and push aside much of the malt, though some moderate toasty, lightly sourdough-like malts fight back (munich maybe?). Pine sap and wintergreen sit starkly on the end, with a clean yeast and very minimal malt sugars. With warming and breathing, the carbonation lessens and the effect is to allow the hop aromas to spread out more and become a little more ""fuzzy"". Not as concentrated, thick and oily, though still displaying plenty of conifer and white grapefruit. Alcohol is lightly felt and the strength of the beer hangs on the end, with a bit of doughiness and dextrinous heft. Fruitiness is immediately apparent, but it�s a light pineapple-peach flavor that gives way quickly to strong pine and very dry white grapefruit notes. Some breadiness from the malt, maybe, and definitely moderate dextrines. Carbonation is kind of a let down. For a bottle conditioned beer, it�s a bit loose and prickly. Acidity constantly and inevitably builds up, but enough brisk pine and citrus flavors hang on to keep it enjoyable all the way to the end. You know what else? This beer is about 4 months old. No doubt it has lost a lot of its hop flavor and aroma, showing more bitterness than was intended by the brewer. Still must be incredibly bitter fresh, but with that fresh simcoe that still shows through strongly even now."
Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Bottle shared by cquiroga on 12/1/06: Lightly effervescent golden bronze color with a frothy off-white head. Fresh, grainy sweet toasty caramel malty aroma has some earthy piny hop character. Body starts sweet and with some sugar cookie doughiness and piny grapefruity hop balance toward a crisp, drier bitter finish. Needs some more big aroma hops, but otherwise a pretty nice IIPA.
Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Big fruity nose and powerfully grapefruit-esque. This one is simultaneously smooth and bitter (not palate burning)on the finish. Hazy, clouded tawny/copper color with a small, well-centered white head. Prominent and columnular lacing. Exceptional IPA!
Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Draft: Pours an etremely cloudy orange with a small tight head. Not a huge aroma, but definitely some hops and malt honey aroma. Flavor is a little sweet but with a huge hop bitterness and floral citrusy flavors. Medium to light body goes down pretty easy, quite tasty. Hop bitterness lingers.
Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;This is a truely awsom Doulble IPA! It is like jack hammers on the tongue. A much have for any true HOP HEAD!
Midnight Sun 11th Anniversary Double IPA;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;December 2006 Bottling. Light peach color. Ample froth. Ok hop aroma. Lemony and grapefruity, but not overly citrusy like I like, and a bit medicinal. Nice malt sweetness melds with the hops well . The hops are fairly nice, I�m just so used to Dreadaught which is so bright and citrusy, and amazing I might add. But this does have some positive aspects. It has some very nice lemon oil flavors that are fairly lasting, with a few citrus fruits. This is a good Double IPA worth seeking out. Drink it a little warmer than usually recommended for this style.

Earle Estates Pear Mead;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Sampled from a 750 ml bottle this mead poured a dark golden color with no head and no lacing.

Earle Estates Pear Mead;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;750ml Bottle. Pours translucent pale yellow. Aromas of canned pears, tart apples, and fresh pear juice, with the slightest waft of alcohol. The flavor is similar with sweet apples and pears, tart green apples, vinous alcohol notes, combined with semi-sweet and boozy honey. Body is thin yet slightly sticky, going down smooth and sweet. Things I didn�t enjoy is the lack of a nose (really had to search for it), and watered down mid-palate taste that cut the fruity notes off from the honey and alcohol. Not bad. but nothing special.
Earle Estates Pear Mead;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Double blech...Aroma reminds me of Libby�s Fruit Cocktail, maybe even canned pears. Not appealing in the least. Odd part is, the aroma is really only present when the glass is swirled. The flavor is as bad as I have come to fear, sweet apple juice. I admit I am new to mead, but I think the honey needs to have a more noticable presence. I have to agree with boboski in questioning if this even needs to be on the site as it is 70% pear wine. After this one, I might even have to re-visit the cherry mead from the same producer.
Earle Estates Pear Mead;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Courtesy dsnowden. Pours a clear light yellow color. A little syrupy looking, but not too much. Smells like apples or apple juice in the nose. I guess I get a little pear in there, but its been so long since I smelled a pear that it might not be. The taste has alot more apple than pear in my opinionm but very subtle and crisp. The sweetness isnt overbearing and it goes down really smooth. The pear flavor comes out more in the finish and the aftertaste. Pretty nice citrusy mead. Refreshing and great for desserts. Thanks Dan!
Earle Estates Pear Mead;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;750 mil bottle. Pours a clear, pale gold with no head. Very pleasant sweet aroma of pears and honey.

Founders Two Guys IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);First IPA out of the NorthWest, sticky hop nose, super hop presence in the flavor, very tastey, seems to need a little bit more malt balance and character to realy pull it off, I didn�t even know they were calling it a dub until just now, oh those two
Founders Two Guys IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);on tap at the brewery. The waitress said that this was made by these two guys in a brewing contest. The prize was that the winner gets to have their beer made by founders. She said that it was supposed to be ala dreadnaught and I really really wish that she wouldnt have said that because it really doesnt compare to that. Standing alone this is very good. Clear copper with a thin white head. Nose is faint copper and hops. Taste is copperish hoppy and again thin. There is a sweetness with the malts that comes out more in the middle followed by some pine hops.
Founders Two Guys IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders, the winner of a local brewing contest, and a damned good one at that. Hazy orange body, medium cream head. Bitter piney, resiny hops dominated the aroma. Caramely, sweet bready malts provided a fine backbone for the bitter, piney hops. Rich body, somewhat sweet, and well-balanced for an I2PA. Long, bitter finish. Excels in competence, if not creativity.

Newport Storm Rhode Island Blueberry;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Newport Craft Brewing;"This a light, refreshing beer. It�s crisp and fruity, but it isn�t too sweet. It�s not particularly memorable, but it�s good! It toes the line between ""fruit beer"" and ""carbonated fruity drink you consume by the pool,"" but there is enough ""beer"" flavor there to not write it off as a Mike�s Hard Lemonade type drink."

Newport Storm Rhode Island Blueberry;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Newport Craft Brewing;Bottle. A more or less clear one, dark golden in color and with a small, off-white head. The aroma is dominated by blueberries, unfortunately it�s in a quite artificial way. Some generic fruityness and a biscuity malt touch too. The flavor is pretty much the same, artificial blueberry and biscuity malts, but there�s also some piney, grassy hops and bitterness. Medium to thin on the palate, with a soft carbonation. Fake, grainy finish. Not actually bad this one, but way too artificial for my liking. 150609

Newport Storm Cyclone Series Derek;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Imperial;Newport Craft Brewing;Bottle drunk on 7/8/07, at about 1 year of age. Dark chocolate body is medium-clear, with a medium-tan head atop that is one finger high and slowly fading to cover, leaving moderate lacing. All sorts of chocolate notes in the nose hold back much of the roast, while juicy, green hops add a pleasant complexity, despite being your average C-hop and aged 1 year. Some peanut brittle-like oxidation is noted on the end, but remains the only real sign of age, while some very dark coffee notes slowly give way to a more abundant fruitiness, as it warms. Low alcohol warmth and though it is a lighter, more manageable version, I dont think it suffers from this fact and dosent seem thin or washed out in the nose. No flaws that I could find, that�s certainly something new for this brewery and probably points to more aging for their beers being needed. Chocolate and biscuits collide with a very sweet, marshmallow-vanilla creaminess, while bitter hops and bitter roast are soaked up well by this maltiness and downplayed by the low carbonaion (though it isnt too low). German chocolate cake, splashed with some old coffee about sums up the flavor, but hops continuously evolve and work with some of the fruitiness that emerges with warming to create a modest complexity. Alcohol is not perceived, no flaws. Pretty impressive for a 12 oz, filtered, non-bottle conditioned bottle of its age from this brewery. As with the aroma, there�s only a small amount of flabby, peanut-brittle-like oxidation. Alot like 2 Bros. Northwind Impy in its mellow presentation, though I think this one adds a bit more bitterness.
Newport Storm Cyclone Series Derek;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Stout - Imperial;Newport Craft Brewing;"12oz bottle, freebie courtesy of argo0. Thanks, Aaron! Pours a dark brown color; khaki-colored head with good retention and fine-bubbled lacing. Dark chocolate, roasted malts, and marshmallow in the aroma; hints of anise and alcohol. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: burnt malts and dark chocolate upfront; moderately dense and chewy, with lots of burnt / charred qualities, but not much depth; slightest herbal hop presence. A one-dimensional imp stout. Lengthy, burnt malt and dark chocolate finish; slightly dry."

Pours an opaque black with a moderate, frothy, tan head that left heaving lacing down the entire glass. Pleasant aroma of malt and caramel with maybe a hint of chocolate.

Millys Tavern Birthday IPA;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;"Growler (originally from a cask); pours a dark amber/brown/orange color, little to no head or carbonation. Aroma is seriously hoppy with grapefruit/citrus elements. The flavor is sharp with hops, yet smooth and sugary, almost a hint of toffee or molasses... but still dominated by hops. I�m usually scared off by serious I.P.A.s, but this one wasn�t too deadly despite all its extreme hoppiness."

Millys Tavern Birthday IPA;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;[cask @ brewpub] Murky amber color, with a subtle, bubbly head. Aroma is HOPS, loads of citrusy, fresh hops. Flavors are a very complex- barleywine sweetness, IPA bitterness and glorious fresh hops. The dry hops are certainly front and center, but the bitterness doesn�t overpower the other characteristics of this brew. Mouthfeel is soft, due to the cask conditioning. Overall, this is an outstanding brew, one of the most memorable I�ve had.

Flavors are about the same. Undercarbonated, soft, wet, and mushy. I just can�t get a good hefe flavor out of this. Lacking a refreshing quality and with an unfortunate yeast experience.

Great Waters Stonehenge Pale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;Fresh from the cask pull, this beer is a beautiful deep amber, brightly clear, and topped by a couple inches of creamy off-white foam. Good head retention and lacing. Green hoppy aroma. This beer is mainly about the hops, fresh and green a tangy with a little bit of unripe peach. The malt is well hidden, but reminded me a bit of Boddington�s - mild and slightly honeyed. Very creamy texture to this beer.
Great Waters Stonehenge Pale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;On cask a little while back. I didn�t concentrate to heavily on this one, which is an approach that tends to fit GW�s brews pretty nicely on most occasions, i think. Yellowish, caramel colored brew with a slightly lagery aroma, nutty tones included. Somewhat bitter flavor with a more pronounced sour character, tart like lime or lemon juice. Not nearly as interesting as TH�s pub ale or as Stonehenge - each recommended over this brew.

Simon Prestige;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Specialty Grain - Other;Brasserie Simon;Bottle: Had this beer many many times in the past. Every vacation in or around Luxembourg we had several of the Simon beers and some other beers from local or even Belgium/German brewers. As a matter of fact I got one bottle of this beer cellared which past it�s prime about 12 years ago.. Not sure if this would still be drinkable and more than just some honey... Old rating, spiced up a tiny bit: White head on top of a yellow golden beer. Smell dust, malts, older flowers and grains. Taste bitters, malts, hops, grains, plants and some yeast. Quite easy drinkable and enjoyed it on several evenings. The No�l is the best from Simon! But this is quite an easy beer, nothing complex, strange or great, but just a fine beer what you exactly know what to expect from...
Simon Prestige;Wiltz, Luxembourg;Specialty Grain - Other;Brasserie Simon;Dec 2009: Brown 33cl bottle best before 20th May 2010. Poured into my huge �Judas� glass. The beer was a misty, cloudy dull lemon colour, the head pure white and fading in size before I had taken a sip and sniff. To be fair though, the collar did produce some good lacing as I downed the beer. Real yeasty aroma, with some citrus notes in there too, grapefruit and lemons, but not a sour feel or smell to it. Very fizzy and light in both taste and texture. I have read this is 92% beer and 8% local sparkling wine, the taste backs this up. Different that�s for sure, not overly impressed, but glad I�ve had one. In the right place and circumstances this could/would be a great drink to bring out. Sadly my house tonight isn�t either.

Buzzards Bay Pilsner;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Bottled@The Chriso Gaylord Tasting. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is quite dry pilsish (a.k.a. bready malts, some grassy and hayish notes along with some slight saltwatery notes). Flavour being much the same.
Buzzards Bay Pilsner;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buzzards Bay Brewing;A Mes rate. Bottle at Chris O�s Night of the Gaylords. Clean gold with a thin white head. Nice and fruity plus some decent sherbet hoppage. A little hint of card but not enough to spoil it. Straight forward and drinkable. A pleasant pils.
Buzzards Bay Pilsner;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Bottle at the Chriso Gaylord tasting 09. Clear gold, lasting white head. No great aroma, at least no cardboard. Cold, soft and some hop on finish.
Buzzards Bay Pilsner;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Bottle I picked up at Julio�s back in October. Never got around to rating the BB stuff figuring it was local enough that I�d get to it all eventually. Then they went out of business, so only managed to get a couple of what was left out there. Pours a slightly hazy treacle hued amber with a medium sized white head. Loads of citrus and grain. A bit thicker and sweeter than I�d think for a pilsner, with a bit more grain. Really grainy and bitter on the finish. Papery. Seems like it might have been a really good lawnmower beer at one point, possibly nice and crisp, but time has probably killed that.
Buzzards Bay Pilsner;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Bottle. Pours a hazy orangish color with a small foamy white head. Nose is sugary with grassy hop notes. Palate is full and sticky. Flavors or bitter hops toasted malts and grassy notes.

Aroma is moderately sweet, grassy, flowery, berry, light bread. Taste is medium sweet, grass, some bread, light berry. Soft light-medium body, light acidity.
Buzzards Bay Pilsner;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buzzards Bay Brewing;Pours deep gold into a shaker. White head pancakes and recedes leaving spider lacing. Sweet caramel malt and saaz hop aromas. Crisp with upfront caramel turning astringent in the lasting metallic and pepper hop finish.
Buzzards Bay Pilsner;Westport, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Buzzards Bay Brewing;12oz Bottle - Downtown Liquors, Somerville, MA. Very subtle and light, herbally-influenced mineral nose. Pours a brilliant, shining clear pale gold, with a tall frothy mauve with good lace. Flavor is distinctly herbal and kind of flaccid. A bit wet and sticky. I�m digging here, but just not finding much to get excited about. Hop bitterness is tentative, metallic, tinny, and thin. It definitely has a characteristic Bohemian Pils ring, but it�s lacking good malt character and nice fresh hoppy snap. I suspect this bottle may be a bit older, unfortunately. However, it�s one of the last. I get the feeling I will miss Buzzard�s Bay, even though I don�t full appreciate that right now.
Sandlot Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Bomber labeled Opening Day Brown Ale 1995 vintage poured a clear reddish brown with a lingering ring of tan foam. Aromas of caramel, sherry and light fruitiness. Palate was light bodied and smooth. Flavors of caramel, sherry and light fruitiness with a smooth lingering sherry finish. Held up surprisingly well for the style.
Sandlot Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);on tap-pours a tan head and brown color. Aroma is medium malt. Taste is sweet medium malt, secondary hops. OK carbonation. Nice-smooth.
Sandlot Brown Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Sandlot Brewery (Molson Coors);Draft at Coor�s Field. Not all that impressed with this one, although I am generally not much of a fan of Brown Ales. Brownish red pour, with very thin head that dissipated immediately, and virtually no lacing. Aroma of nuts, and malt, with touch of honey. Honey-nut was also evident in the flavor, although not real pronounced. Enjoyed the Right Field Red (just prior to this) more.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;On draft at the source. The beer is light yellow with a thin white head. The aroma offers a bit of banana and spice. A bit weak. The flavor is better than the aroma, with banana and clove character more present. Light in body with solid carbonation. One of the better offerings from Flat Branch.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;On tap at brewery. Pours light golden color with white head. Wheat, yeast, banana clove aromas and flavors. Average, nothing special.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;It poured a reddish color. The aroma was malts and spices. The flavor was weak hops and spice. An ok Weizen.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Pour is a clear gold with a large white head. Aroma is a little clove and spice with breadyness. Flavor is a dull wheat and none of the cloves show up in the flavor. Kinda finishes dry but uneventful. My samples of this style are few and far between so i would not even know of this is close to being spot on for the style.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;The pour is mostly clear with a nich white cap. There�s an odd sour/tang in the nose. There�s some clove, but the odd character detracts. The flavor is much better though. Bavarian yeast character balanced with herbal hops and a crisp, refreshing finish.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;PIlsner-ish offering. Almost tasteless except for a lingering carbonated staleness. Weak all around.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Sampler @ brewpub. Comes to me with a completely clear, dark straw color. The carbonation is visible and strong. Has a thick head that leaves a lightly sticky lacing. It looks very nice, I am surprised I could find beauty in a filtered beer but this works. Aroma is surprisingly a thick white bread maltiness with some lemon and herbal hops. Definitely comes off as a filtered hefe but it actually works great. The esters are so reduced that these other aspects shine, especially since they are so vibrant and clean. Taste is similar where the lemon aspects are stronger. A beautiful execution of a clean wheat beer. It is easy drinking and fun, I never thought I would say that about a Kristal Weizen.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Tap at the restaurant. Kind of a hazy reddish pour. No head. Aroma is malts and spices. Flavor is some weak hops and spice. An ok beer. Very medium to light body. No real aftertaste.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;The beer is very clear, and slightly hazy from being served too cold. Has alight spice nose, with almost no flavor on the palate, very light wheaty notes, but lacks body and is slightly watery in the finish. Disappointing.
Flat Branch Kristal Weizen;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;A little bit weak, but tastey. Hop in the front and an almosty malty flavor at end. Very mild, but very good. Quite a smooth palate.
Flat Branch Strawberry Lager;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;I got to say, as far as fruit flavored beer in the summer time go, this is actually good. Most brewpubs just phone it in but this is not your generic wheat with fake flavor added. This was straight strawberry puree which can be seen in the murky pinkish color of the beer. The strawberry puree comes out marvelously, not sweet but just real berry fruit. The base lager serves as the perfect platform for this concoction. Sampler at the brewpub.
Flat Branch Strawberry Lager;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Draft, 8/4/07. hefe hazy with just a tinge of red in the center. Definite strawberry smell. Taste shows more body than the Pete�s Strawberry, but here the strawberries and malts are just fighting each other instead of blending smoothly. Nice dry finish, though a bit gassy.
Flat Branch Strawberry Lager;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Not overwhelmingly strawberry. Smelled fruity but tasted like any good lager with a bit of sweetness. My wife loved it.
Flat Branch Strawberry Lager;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;A very real strawberry aroma, like actually berries, maybe a little of the frozen variety, but real berrries, not extract like many others. It looked like a wehat beer with a tint of pink, like a shot of peptobismal was dropped in a mixed. Minimal beer flavro though.
Alchemist Mortal Sin;Stowe, Vermont, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;The Alchemist;"A very aromatic dark beer ... not very familiar with Black IPA�s but i must say that this rocked me! Slight resiny hops with a hint of citrus laying on a bed of sugary toffee caramel with no intention of ever getting up... A nice semi persistant white foam covers the beer as the carbonation is very light and ""fluffy"" ... hard to describe! In the background there�s a faint fruitiness, too faint for me to try and name any particular fruit, but it just rounds up perfectly the experience!!!"
Alchemist Mortal Sin;Stowe, Vermont, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;The Alchemist;"My Bottom Line: This cushiony and ever-so-aromatic Black IPA hypnotizes with its gorgeous leafy hop resins, their citrusy tips and the jazzy nutty caramel malt character which accompanies them throughout. Further Personal Perceptions: -A thick sheet of foam bobs and laces atop the hazy reddish-brown. -The body is a feathery pillow of malt and soothing carbonation. -Malts are also a tad chocolatey. -Some fruitiness seems to come from the malts as well. -John Kimmich is the east�s king of the dry-hop. Know that. ;) On tap at the brewpub."
Alchemist Mortal Sin;Stowe, Vermont, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;The Alchemist;Dark ruby body topped by a long-lasting medium beige head. Powerful aroma of roastiness dominated by citrusy hops. Tasty and original beer. Cleverly blends tasty american bitter hops (pine-tree and citrusy) with lots of roastiness and caramel wrapped in chocolate flavours. Brings together an American IPA and a dry stout and it works. Assertive hops (Simcoe?). One of the most darkly roasted of this new trend of India Dark Ale I�ve had. Nice body that mixes dry roastiness and juicy hopping. At the pub, described as having 6.66% alcohol and 66.6 IBU !!! Mortal Sin, the Decimal of the Beast.
Alchemist Mortal Sin;Stowe, Vermont, United States;IPA - Black/Brown/Cascadian Dark;The Alchemist;"Draft - 6/23/07 update - Surprised to see this one. This batch was particularly hoppy with lots of grapefruit/citrus. Truly delightful!! = Original rating - A new entry for the master brewer from Vermont. Pours a quite dark, almost brown, amber in color with a thin whitish head that faded quickly. The strong aroma of hops only begins to prepare you for the *big* hop flavor that is to come. HOPS is what this beer is all about, but there is a balance with some malt that removes some of the ""bite"" that hops sometimes can give. Nicely strong piney/grapefruit hop flavor that fades to a fairly long and bitter finish. Very clean on the palate. A wonderful addition to John�s offerings and one that hope to experience again and soon!"
Breckenridge Honey Bock;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Breckenridge Brewery (AB InBev);Had a 2 ounce glass of this draft as part of a 6 beer sampler at the brewery. This was one of the two special seasonal brewss they said they were offering on the sampler. Had a light orange color (almost like a pale ale), with little head or lacing. Hops and honey were evident in both the aroma and flavor. The palate was slightly bitter, which led to a nice finish.
Dominion Herrschaft Kolsch;Dover, Delaware, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at the brewpub. Probably the only decent beer there. Typical dry, bitter and refreshing kolsch style.
Dominion Herrschaft Kolsch;Dover, Delaware, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at the brewpub, RBSG 2006. A hazy orange beer with a thin white head. The aroma has light citrus notes on a good malty back ground. The flavor is sweet with light malty notes with a nice amount of citrus. A very refreshing beer with a light body.
Dominion Herrschaft Kolsch;Dover, Delaware, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draught at Old Dominion for breakfast - RBSG DC 06 Yellow, misty light head and lacing. Nose of citrus and pale malt, light grass and hop. The flavor is snappy, cold, a bit hoppy (bitter) and tart. Thin body and a lingering malt sweetness. Forgettable.
Dominion Herrschaft Kolsch;Dover, Delaware, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);(Draught) Pours a clear yellow body with a small white head. Aroma is skunky with some sourness. Flavor of sweet malt, honey, light lemon, and skunky hops.
Dominion Herrschaft Kolsch;Dover, Delaware, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Clear straw body with white head. Aroma is medium sweet, straw/grass, some bread. Taste is medium sweet, straw/grass, apple, sone honey, bread. Light body, some crispness.
Dominion Herrschaft Kolsch;Dover, Delaware, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft at Old Dominion before RBSG. Gold bodied. Aroma is grassy, buttery and biscuity with soft lemony notes. taste is grassy and slightly hoppy, soft biscuity or toasty malts, light lemony flavors, and a touch of honey. Body is crisp and medium with a smooth carboantion feel. Finish with more grassy notes, light buttery biscuits, soft honey, and lemon.
Dominion Herrschaft Kolsch;Dover, Delaware, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);(Draft at the pub) Clear sparkling golden body topped by a thin white head. The aroma is grassy lightly metallic. The flavor is more grass with a light bit of sweetness. Light crisp body. Not bad especially for an oft abused style.
Dominion Herrschaft Kolsch;Dover, Delaware, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Sampled at Dominion Brewfest �06. I was told that this was Dominion�s first Kolsch. Clear golden with quickly fading white head. Zesty lemon, grassy hops in the nose. Flavor has notes of grain, citrus/lemon and a very pleasant grassy, herbal noble hop character. Moderately sweet, the hop bitterness is pronounced in the finish but not overdone. Medium bodied with a smooth texture and medium/lively carbonation. I found this one to be quite enjoyable.
Browarmia Imbirowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;Dark amber with rich creamy beige head. Strong pleasant fruity ginger aroma. Medium bitter with strong ginger notes, not sweet. Metallic notes.
Browarmia Imbirowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;Draught, at Browarmia, September 2005. A clear, brown to amber ale, with malt and sweetness the main flavours here. A hint of licquorice and aniseed. Although these flavours are not to my personal taste, I appreciated on drinking that this is a well-crafted beer with all the flavour and textures intentional, and I can see why others would enjoy it, therefore I am marking it upon its merits.
Browarmia Imbirowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;This is a beer not commonly available at the excellent brewpub Browarmia in Warsaw. They usually have a lager, a wheat and a stout. In addition they have this ginger ale, a cherry beer (very dry just as it should be) and they have plans for a pale ale or a bock. This beer has a strange metallic aroma with some cherry. It looks like a pale cola. The taste is very sweet of malt, with no appareant ginger. Newcastle Brown Ale springs to mind. In the finish, the cherries felt in the aroma turn into sherry. Very foamy palate.
Holts Golden Boot;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Joseph Holt;Cask@The Market Porter, Borough, London. A horribly thin watery bitter. Some grainy malt, maybe some hops, but pretty much nothing.
Holts Golden Boot;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Joseph Holt;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. Gold with thin white head. Refreshing summer golden bitter. Easy drinking with good citric hop. Hop on finish is spikey. Needs more malt.
Old Mill Three Lions;Snaith, East Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Mill Brewery;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. Copper colour with thin off white head. Yeasty bitter. Yeasty in mouth. Apple acid and hop on end. Yeasty, and undeveloped bitter.
Hanby Summers Coming;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wem Brewing;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. Copper colour with no head. Rubbery hop aroma, quite malty with a hop finish. Oh wow. A not very good bitter. Oh Joy!
McGuinness Summer Tipple;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;McGuinness;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. Deep chestnut colour. As unlikely a summer beer as you�ll find. Lots of choccy malt and yeast on aroma and earthy choccy malt on end. Someone is having a gag here. But there is some citrus too. Bizarre, odd. A lemoney choc malt hop beer. Not your usual summer run of the mill beer.
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Spic hop malt aroma. Cloudy pale yellow colour with good head and lacing. Sweet malt hop flavour with floral undertones. Fizzy palate.
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Looks quite good for a beer from this producer; glowing orange with lemon coloured edges and a nice thin creamy head. I think it does have a Coopers-esque nose; sweet citrus and faint estery notes. Palate is ok, more citrus fruity notes (albeit mild) but the sweet syrupy adjunction, corn syrup flavours do detract. Fizz at a good level. Easily the best LN beer I�ve had in recent timees."
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);From a 330ml bottle. I have to agree with the other posters. Reading the label, it says balanced flavour and aroma.. I�d agree there. If you call bland balanced.Something I expect at the work Christmas party to keep people somewhat happy.
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Hmmm, don�t quite know what to make of this. Slight citrus on the nose and some slight skunkiness. There are some apple and pear flavours with light malts that finishes well with some pleasent light bitterness. It is quite an innoffensive quaffer and a lot less work to down than a vic or for that matter a coopers if you were on a night out with the lads. I don�t see this as a rip off of Coopers at all except that the naming of it as Pale Ale, so what? When I bought it, I didn�t know if it would be IPA, American Pale ale, or old fashioned aussie pale ale and coopers didn�t come in to play at all. On Merit, I�d consider buying more at a bar, but would not be the first choice to buy at home. Now that the tasting bit is out of the way, what do I really think? It is a bit like Hahn is being used to push the James squire Boutiqueness to the masses. There are plenty of people that will drink hahn, but not JS etc. I don�t think this is aimed at the Coopers drinkers at all since they are all too loyal for something like this, but at the same time,
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled: as everyone points out its a attempt at cashing in on the popularity of the Coopers Pale Ale. Naturally, instead of being bold, thet�ve opted for bland. Bland light citrus aroma, bland body, bland half-assed faint malt flavour, bland finish and bland packaging. A very boring beer in total, but at least it wasn�t skunked I suppose. Re-rate I guess I was a bit harsh since there is an appreciatible citrus flavour in the body. It is also an easy drinker which is the plan I think. Still pretty bland
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Don�t know why they bothered. Looks like Bundaberg Ginger beer in the glass with just as much head as one of those could raise (none). Little bit of seaweed and celery in the otherwise metallic aroma, and also, as aforementioned - it smells of skunk. Damn, that�s some bad shit! Just returned from Germany to this, my first beer back in Oz. Bloody woeful. It tastes like I�d imagine a bar-towel tastes when wringed out after a Sunday session. It�s got just a percentage of VB, EB and Swan Draught all mixed into one gassy, metallic and zingy mess that just turned my stomach. Second mouthful had some watery pear and apple with some fizz-whizz thrown in for complexity. What are these boys thinking at the top. It becomes pasty after a few swills, and that bastard celery comes through again. I can�t finish this..... no more notes! (33cL, 22/02/07, Morley Liquor Merchants)
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);�Classically Cloudy�. As indicated by my esteemed colleagues (all 3 of them but all great blokes to share a beer with) there is a clear perception of ripped offedness and petty nyah nyah, we can do one too. There is no distinction between this and the Cooper�s beer in appearance either, which by a number of criteria would probably score at the lower end of the scale. Cloudy indeed with a soapy look to it. The nose is certainly citrusy and it lacks the estery freshness of the Coopers beer. The flavour balances rather too subtley in both hop and malt but I would have to say that it appears to at least be a clean and possibly well brewed beer. I think we would expect a little more control over the beer to appease Hahn drinkers, as oposed to hardened Cooperites who expect and accept a slightly dirtier beer. For all the cloud in the glass it is odd not to see any noticeable sediment in the bottle. Not as bad as others consider even though mine only has a 3 day longer life than the laddie�s. Like a lot of the old report cards sitting in a box somewhere, the comment is �could do better�.
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Absolute Coopers Pale Ale rip off, as has been pointed out and will continue to be. Some zesty sour lemon in the aroma, which translated into the flavour very subtly. A bit creamy in the mouth, leaving the flavour feeling rather bland. The finish was pretty vacant (a la the sex pistols), having me picking up the glass again quite soon so that I could remember what it tasted like. Not too bad, but it�s blandness leaves it (and me) wanting.
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"This reeks of petty revenge. Lion Nathan�s take-over offer for Coopers was rebuffed, so they shove out knock-offs like this to compete against Coopers� leading brands. Laughable. This is a pale imitation (pardon the pun) of Coopers Pale Ale, which to be honest isn�t great anyway. How does Chuck Hahn expect to be taken seriously as a brewer when his products are so prone to being light-struck, thanks to the stupid green bottles? This is a brand-new line, so this sample has been corrupted in just a week or two. The aroma is all skunk, with some distant bready malts and metallic POR hops. In the glass, it was a cloudy pear-juice colour and raised a thin head. Great - it tastes skunked, too. I can�t pick any of the subtleties that the reliable Bluevegie found in his sample - all I get are sour watery lemony juice, a nasty coppery finish and SKUNK. Pretty fizzy and burp-inducing, too. Thank fuck Lion Nathan didn�t get their hands on Coopers if this represents the future. (330ml bottle from Randwick Village Cellars; best before 22/2/07)"
Hahn Pale Ale;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);The label on the bottle reminds me of a Coopers Pale Ale, Coopers was the company that Lion Nathan tried unsuccessfully to acquire recently so is this Lion Nathan�s response? Cloudy straw coloured body with an average size, mainly lasting white head. Some grapefruit on the nose but mainly yeast. Easy drinking and better than their Vienna Red. Good carbonation, yeasty, soft lemon, zesty, light to medium in body, drinks alright for a Hahn product just not a lot to make it outstanding.
Browarmia Pszeniczne Ciemne;Warszawa, Poland;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Browarmia Krolewska;Keg (BrowArmia, Warsaw) Rich cloudy brown. Rich nutty aroma. Slightly dusty or smoky palate, rich malts, and a touch sweet, but well within the bounds of a dunkelweizen. Hops gentle, but pleasant. Toffee finish, and plenty of roast grains - great example of the style!
Browarmia Pszeniczne Ciemne;Warszawa, Poland;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Browarmia Krolewska;On draught at the Warsaw brewub. Poured a hazy dark amber with a white head. A big clove aroma. Light-to-medium body with a dry, wheaty flavor matched to a mellow dark malt character along with caramel, coarse hops and a graininess. No apparent traditional style.
Browarmia Pszeniczne Ciemne;Warszawa, Poland;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Browarmia Krolewska;[On draught at the brewpub in Warsaw] Hazy brown colour. Sourish, lactic nose. Lactic acidic mouthfeel, with loads of Co2. Light light mouthfeel, with dark, roasty flavours and notes of chocolate and banana.
Browarmia Stout Swiateczny;Warszawa, Poland;Stout;Browarmia Krolewska;Watery with sour after taste. Roasted coffee present. Color and aroma were quite ok, but after a few sips it became a chore to drink
Northumberland Northumbrian Fayre;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);Cask Stillage from the Cellar at the Crescent, Salford 27/05/2005 Clear golden coloured fruity and hoppy with a hint of bitterness in a crisp and floral malt finish.
Northumberland Northumbrian Fayre;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);Cask gravity at Red Lion, Snargate. My 1900th beer and actually a pretty good bitter. Copper colour with thin off white head. Nice herby hop. I like this bitter. Good hop/malt balance
Pioneer Bavarian Wheat;East Haven, Connecticut, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pioneer Beer Company (Connecticut Valley Brewing);Sample at the brewery and from a growler. Pours opaque gold with a rich white head. Initial aromas of coriander and oranges quickly give way to grassy hints, lemons, and some yogurt. Tastes lemony and grassy with some decent banana hints. Pretty solid.
Pioneer Bavarian Wheat;East Haven, Connecticut, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pioneer Beer Company (Connecticut Valley Brewing);on tap-pours an offwhite head with cloudy yellow color. Aroma is clove. Taste is raw clove, tart, wheat. A work in progress is my understanding.
Round Barn Brewery Moersch Pale Ale;Baroda, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Round Barn Brewery;Sample in the tasting room. Classic goldenlook with thin head given it was served in a plastic cup. Nose was lovely citrus crass with a hint of basil or rosemary. Slightly toasted in the mouth with orange and green flavours. Hopping tasted like cascade or amarillo. Malt flavours included vinnena or munich. Dry finish and a wonderfully refreshing treat after tasting brandy for an hour.
New Holland Rauch Hatter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Holland Brewing Company;Draft @ Maproom. Clear amber with a thin, white head. The nose shows the true IPA style it�s based upon. The pine and grapefruit come through in full force with the smoked malt evident, but fairly subtle and hiding in the mix. Some caramel sweetness comes out from time to time as well. The body is on the light side of moderate with active carbonation. Again, the flavor rears it�s IPA base and shows an influence of smoke. It�s not to say you can�t pick up on the smoke, but this is no German Rauchbier, for sure. The smoky and caramel malts start the flavor profile, but the hops are substantial enough to dominate from the middle on. This one took about a third of pint to get into as the flavor combo is a bit unique. However, I thoroughly enjoyed it by the time I was finishing the pint. Good, but not something I�d want all that often.
New Holland Rauch Hatter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Holland Brewing Company;on tap at NHBC...amber body with small white head...aroma of flowers and pine, with a strong smoked backbone...flavor is what you would expect when u added smoke to an already good ipa...smoke is dominant, yet the aftertaste is purely piney and bitter...nice palate
New Holland Rauch Hatter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;New Holland Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. No head and no visable carbonation. Amber in color. Nose is smoking and flat. Taste is initially bacon greases followed by some apple smoked bacon. Just a bit of hops towards the back but the smoke is really dominate. I try hard to get to like this kind of stuff but it is just a style that I can not tolerate easily.

New Holland Belgian Hatter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Holland Brewing Company;I have this named as Belgian imperial hatter as well. Similar to every other damn hatter (outside of the rauch hatter). Copper pour. Piney, grapefruit aroma with slight belgian yeast (I think). Ditto on the flavor. I question how different their hatter beers are from eachother. This was pretty good, but very similar to their other offerings
New Holland Belgian Hatter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Holland Brewing Company;Draught @ New Holland. Pours a clear amber color with a small off white head that leaves specks of lace. The aroma is fresh citrus (mainly grapefruit) with some herbs and pine and the slightest malt influence. The flavor was much of the same with the malt component being a bit more prominent. There is also some yeast that works its way into the flavor as well. Medium bodied.
New Holland Belgian Hatter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Holland Brewing Company;"On tap at New Holland. AKA Belgian Imperial Hatter. Caramely red body, thin creamy off-white head. Piney, grapefruity hops and toast in the aroma. Not too distinctive from the regular Imperial Hatter. Flavor was the same, resiny and strongly citrusy, with a subtle yeast component that I suppose makes this ""Belgian."" Rather thin body with an alcohol bite."
New Holland Belgian Hatter;Holland, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;New Holland Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Thin white head, amber to brown in color. Nose is hoppy and clean. Soft yeast followed by bright crisp hops. Good. Very enjoyable.

The creamy body is well balanced with moderate bitterness and a solid caramel back. Continues with rose petals, perfume and fruit rinds. A great starter IPA that is nicely balanced and keeps the bitterness in check.

The nose is strong pine with hops and greapefruit. Nearly sour. Taste is strong with grapefruit and hops with a big kick. Would almost think that I am on the west coast with this thing.

City Steam Chet Baker India Pale Lager;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;City Steam Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Nice copper pour with a bubbly tan head. Odd, candylike nose - sweet, but tart. Like a jolly rancher crossed with a SweeTart. Notes of orange powdered Kool-Aid. Sweet orange citrus notes, orange rind and pepper in the finish. Too powderey tasting for me. Not good.
City Steam Chet Baker India Pale Lager;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;City Steam Brewery;Pint on tap at the brewpub. Citrus, orangey aroma. Man, is this orange-nectarine-like. Quite aromatic. Smells tasty. Transparent dark copper color with a small, off-white/khaki head. Starts very hoppy, with citrus and orangey hops. There is also some distinct hempy hop notes later on as this finishes. There is a nice, pleasant chewy malty body. This is tasty and very well-done. I wish they had this stuff regularly.

Rock Bottom Warrenville Hair of the Tongue;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Bottom Warrenville;On tap Brewery 7/20/06-This was a great double IPA. Had a nice orangish color with a good head. Taste of hops and citrus. Great beer.
Rock Bottom Warrenville Hair of the Tongue;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Bottom Warrenville;On tap. Rosy orange color with a frothy head that lasted well into the drink. Super-Charged with hops that carry a nice grapefruit aroma with them. Good balance with a malt backbone that is substantial. Alcohol is abundant and welcomed. Finish is nicely bitter and long. Probably the best effort that I�ve had from this particular RB.
Wyre Piddle Piddle over Monnow;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;On tap in the Kings Head, Monmouth, Wales. Great appearance in glass, very good head. Bronze in colour however just a slight haze in appearance. Very smooth taste with a slight bitterness. Quite sweet and hoppy. Overall a an easy to drink ale with a little tangyness.
Spinning Dog Pickles;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hereford Brewery;On tap in the Boat, Penaullt. Zesty aroma with a clear dark copper appearance. Slight head but dissipears totally. Fruity ale with a good bittness. Overall this beer is rather fruity, but suprisling not to sweet with it.

Hong Kong Beer Co. Porter Ale;Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Porter;Hong Kong Beer Co.;[Draught at Hong Kong Brew House, Lan Kwai Fong] Dark brown with minimal head. Sweet and light bodied with mellow mouthfeel. Pleasant coffee dominates together with pine needles. The near watery body gives way to a light salty metallic bitterness. Highly undeveloped malt character.
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Bottle, from a fancy supermarket in a fancy shopping mall in HK island. Not easy to find this beer. Usually most stores will have a vast assortment of chinese crappy lagers. This one tastes a bit like an ale, malty, with a honeyish tinge and some spice, mainly cloves and ground coriander. Interesting beer. Rating would be better if it wasn�t for the atrocious nose of eructation and flatulence. Now, having said that, it is still worthwhile as compared to the Chinese options.
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;"(bottle) clear amber with small off white head; faint aromas of soy sauce, fruit; generally simple flavour with long, medium bitter and mineral finish; not great but better than most asian beers"
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;It�s a refreshing beer from Hong Kong and a nice touch to bottle it. A good drink and far superior to the Tsing Tao / San Miguel macro rubbish, but not as nice as the AB
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;35 cl bottle, 4.7% thanks to a friend who brough me from HK. Pours amber color, clear, average offwhite head, looks like a Vienna. On the nose sems malty. Aroma is softly malty, slightly roasted, a bit of caramel and a metallic\copper hue, mineral notes. Hop is not shining thru, but there�s some. There�s something else i can�t define what it is, somewhat citrusy and spied, but very faint and difficult to get. Taste is softly bitter, palate is watery and finish is dry. Has a tough life compared to the EU standard, but i guess on the asian maket this has some interesting features.
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Clear dark caramel color. White ring head. Light malt aroma. Cool and clean. Taste is fruity and has a strong bite. Light body. Nice amout of flavor and body for such a light beer. I like that style.
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;"330ml bottle bought from CitySuper in Habour City, Tsim Sha Tsui. Copper colour; No head, foam or lacing - absolutely zero! No carbonation either! This really took me by surprise. Medium to light body; Light smell of malt, some bread and sweetness; Taste is very weird - a mix of light malt, some unpleasant chemical used in oral medication, and a hint of fruitiness - not revolting but it doesn�t makes me feel comfortable. Only slight trace of bitterness, close to none most of the time. Slight dry after taste. Comments: I thought I bought it as a gesture to support Hong Kong�s micro scene, instead, this is a bottle of liquid called �beer� with no obvious characteristics of a half-decent macro lager, and its taste so weird I thought this is straight out from a hospital pharmacy. Tasted just half of it at the rest is drain pours. Prime candidate for RB�s �Worst Beer of the World�. Avoid."
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Pours yellow and fizzy with a white head, No lacing. Malts in the aroma. Light body. Carbonated mouthfeel. Flavor is light hops and some spices,

Aroma of some citrus and malt sweetness. Taste of malt sweetness with a bit of fruit mixed in. Nice bitterness and a clean finish. Light body, crisp, quite smooth and refreshing. Not a bad beer. Good for a couple.
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;The better of the two HK beers I tried. There�s a prominent hop element here. Quite nice. Almost a pilsener.
Hong Kong Beer Co. Hong Kong Beer (-2013);Chai Wan, Hong Kong;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hong Kong Beer Co.;Tried at a super upscale drinkery on the top of one of those Hong Kong Towers, poured quite chilled. Nice aroma of fruitiness on the nose, and malty sweetness. Charming orange-bright brown body with no head, even when poured by an expert waitress - thusly it should be poured headless, one would assume. Taste is a pleasant mix of sweet malts with some fruity touches. Okay mouthfeel. This is a decent beer, worth seeking out if you�re in the city.
Goose Island Saison du Monde;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Courtesy of BBB, growler, July �06. Pale yellow, semi-bright, minimal head. Aroma is all funked out. Huge horseblanket, farmhouse, dustiness, faint spice. Flavor has a bit more spice up front but hard to determine. Maybe staright pepper? Thins out through the middle, fades to skunky bitterness and harsh floral bitterness. Not bad just altogether doesn�t mesh well.
Goose Island Saison du Monde;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap: It poured out a hazy yellow body with a respectable head that didn�t linger for long. A good sniff brings you a nose of yeast, lemon & tart orange, a light malt, hints of wheat, and some hot spices. First up in the taste is a mouthful of citric tartness. This mellows out somewhat, allowing the malts and a floral bitterness to come through with some coriander, grasses, and white pepper tagging along. Nice lingering bitter finish. Goose Island - Clybourn, Chicago, IL
Goose Island Saison du Monde;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Growler: Provided by BBB63. Flowery aroma with light fruit and spice. Pours a hazy pale golden-orange with a small white head. Lightly sweet and yeasty up front with a nice flowery bitterness in the finish with some light spice. Flowery bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.
Goose Island Saison du Monde;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Rerate from Growler served at Styles place: I like this more now, getting some sharp grapefruit and very herbal finish. On tap at Clybourn and served in MBA pint glass, like most times it is way too cold at the start: Hazy golden hue topped by a small frothy head. The aroma has notes of coriander, orange zest, juniper berry, lemongrass, wheat, biscuity malt and dusty yeast esters. The taste starts spicy for sure with a lot of fruit tones in the background. A touch acidic and woody with some pepper and herbs on the finish. It could be a bit cleaner and dryer for my tastes but is quite drinkable. The mouth feel is smooth yet has some bite near the edges, a tad sticky too. An okay beer (more a wit than Saison IMO) and with a bit more refinement I would really dig it.
Goose Island Saison du Monde;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);clybourn tap. not too bad. pretty mild aroma and taste. served too cold. hazy light urine color. little head. kinda sour, a bit of belgian funk. actually pretty good at first, but mere ounces later it�s cloying.
Goose Island Saison du Monde;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Draught, Clybourn: cloudy, incredibly opaque pineapple; pretty thin, quickly diminishing ivory head that leaves a thin film...mildy hoppy, mango flesh aroma, thick with mashed grains and spent wort. Flavour is very mild with some underlying black pepper and herbal spice. Smooth, creamy palate with a subtle tingle...finish is fairly fruity with orange zest bitterness, pineapple sweetness and wet yeast...perhaps the next �saison� can be a dry farmhouse style...this one just didn�t have as much character as I was hoping..."
Goose Island Saison du Monde;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);A sour, grassy yeasty Belgian style summer beer. Cloudy yellow body with a small barely visible head. Taste of orange and small levels of sweet spice (coriander?). Not expecially sweet for an orange and spice Belgian, and this works well, especially for a low alchohol version of a style that is usually bigger.
Goose Island Saison du Monde;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Super hazy and murky dull golden orange beneath 8 bubbles passing as a head. A fruity nose of orange, sweet lemon, mild coriander, some tropical fruit esters of melon and mango, subtle earthy hops, fresh dough, more light spice, floral perfume and a hint of light grain. The body is moderately think with seemingly mild carbonation and a lasting tingle. The flavor is definitely yeasty with some moderately sweet fruit, bitter earthiness and tart wheat-esque notes. The finish is crisply bitter and lasting, especially for the lower alcohol and carbonation. In many ways this is more like a Belgian Wit than a Saison, but with much more spice and ester content and less straight-ahead fruitiness. Enjoyable, but I wish Goose Island would try a Dupont-style, unspiced Saison. More of the same can be a little repetitive.
Longwood West Coast Pale Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Longwood Brewpub;Dark amber colour. Earthy hop nose. The flavour is well-balanced and multifaceted...fresh woody, mossy hop, lightly toasty, earthy malts and subtle yeast accents. About as good as an EPA can get, really.
Longwood West Coast Pale Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Longwood Brewpub;(Draught) Sampled at the brewery in a 6oz glass. Dissipated white foamy head with a well-carbonated copper body. Nose is as distant from what a member would consider a West Coast Pale Ale as possible. Nice malted flavour and doubled-up hops. Good enough beer but not the PNW variety.
Custom Brewcrafters Rye Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;On cask at Tap and Mallet. Supposedly dry hopped but that fell a little short. Also noted it was an unfiltered beer and I got a bit more of that than I did the dry hopping. An earthy and distinct grain presence. A slight citrus aroma but the cask conditioning mutes and muddles the dry hopping here. There�s a slight bitterness on the finish. Overall an ok beer but needs a bit more character from a bigger hop presence or better malt profile.
Custom Brewcrafters Rye Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;I liked this - we had it on a night others in our dinner were having cider, and the 2 drinks looked identical. Aroma was honey, malt. Palate was sweet. Better as it warmed. Not overly complex. Growler purchased at CBC by my brother-in-law.
Custom Brewcrafters Rye Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;They don�t seem to understand what �unfiltered� means. This was listed as unfiltered but is crystal clear gold. Nose is light lemon, slight butter, a little frutiness. Flavor is light butterscotch, fruit, artichokes. Odd and I get no rye. Decent body.
Custom Brewcrafters Rye Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Custom Brewcrafters;(cask @ The Old Toad - Rochester, NY) I had this one a while back, but I�m not sure what the style is. If anyone else knows, please feel free to correct me. Clear yellow with not much head. Aroma is slightly dry and grainy. Taste was a little dry and a little sour. Finished clean and the flavor quickly disappeared from the palate. Very watery and a little unusual.
75th Street Weedwhacker Light Lager;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;75th Street Brewery;Golden color. Sweet malt aroma. Taste is biscut and herbal hops. Clear, lingering bitterness but very balanced. This is not a beer style that I love, but this is a great example.
75th Street Weedwhacker Light Lager;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;75th Street Brewery;I have a sample of this while hang with the KC Crew. It was pale yellow with some good white foam. Typical grainy aroma and flavor. The thing is, there where some hops. And even some bitterness. Really kind of tastey.
75th Street Weedwhacker Light Lager;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;75th Street Brewery;"Lightly fruity, citric aroma, some pale, lightly grainy malts as well as a faint touch of yeast. Light golden in color with an initially foamy head that subsides. Lightly grainy malt flavor, fruity and very lightly bitter with touches of leafy hop, lemon and perhaps some corn. Has some heft and flavor for its style, and is fairly clean. Described to me by the bartender as their ""Bud Light clone"", as well, but really is much better than that."
75th Street Weedwhacker Light Lager;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;75th Street Brewery;Re-rate. In all fairness to my local brewpub, I have to bump this up after trying a few beers since this one that have sucked in comparison but come out ahead of it due to appearance and other factors. (Bumped up overall and flavor.) Originally 4/2/3/2/4 Aptly named, this is a beer that I can only see myself drinking again if it was free and I have been out in the sun doing yard work all day. Pours a light yellow with a small, white, diminishing head. Looks like the crap we drank from plastic cups in college. The aroma was slightly better than expected with strong, sweet corn backed by faint notes of cookie and citrus. Light, thin and soft, this one is brewed to please all of the BMC fans in the joint. The flavor is sweet, corny and very light, with the slightest hint of citrus in the background and a faint hop note at the finish (very faint). Meh. Waddya want? Its a lager.
75th Street Weedwhacker Light Lager;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;75th Street Brewery;informed by my server that this was their answer to bud drinkers (yes, there actually are plenty of those mindless humanoids who frequent this place, inspite of the fact that it�s a brew pub!) however, this light brew fares far better than any mass produced american lager, it lacks the chickenfeed harshness that chokes the drinker, instead is, well, if you�ll allow...light and easy drinking, goes down smooth...it is very light on the palate, nothing to disturb the uninitiated drinkers, a simple, straight forward pale yellow lager with a hint of sweetness. this is a passable brew that probably would taste nice following an afternoon of lawnmowing and weedwhacking.
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle to stange, the appearance was a deep hazy red/ brown color. One finger white foamy head that dissipated at a decent pace. The aroma takes on some graininess, deep and sweet with some light grassy hops. The flavor has a strong sweet maltiness to it. Grassy hops provide a light bitterness. Light malty aftertaste with the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Low carbonation allows a nice smoothness rolling all around. Overall, decent as a beer that one just wants to just throw down their throat. It�s not much of an altbier but just decent for what it is.
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;5/9/12. 22oz bottle thanks to Arin! Caramel and bready aroma with a hint of something slightly sour. Bready and malty flavor with a bit of caramel and a certain lingering grainy, tea-like aspect. A bit sweet - crystal malts abound. A bit toasty and tea-like. Slightly fruity and plenty smooth. Not bad.
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;22 oz. bottle from Miamilice. Pours clear dark amber copper colored with a off white soapy head that fades to a film and collar. Aroma is malty and earthy bits of nuts and grass with a faint mix of sugars. Taste is more semi sweet malt and grain some grass and subtle bitter hops for the finish and slight metallic notes. Palate is slick a little sticky and drying. Easy drinking beer with no standout characteristics.
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;Poured from a 22oz bottle shared by AirforceHops. Dark tea color, with medium carbonation. Thin off-white head. Aroma is of sweet grain. Which mirrors in the taste along with malt in the background. Decent brew. Love Portsmouth Brews. Haven�t had one I didn�t like. Thanks for sharing bud.
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;22 oz bottle label as Dusseldorf Alt. Bottle purchased about 9 months ago. Deep red/ brown, like Mahogany wood. Real hazy and dark. Thick, full creamy white head. Good amount of carbonation for this brew. Lots of grainy type smell. Taste follows suite. Strong malt base with grain and a corn like taste. Pretty easy to drink, flows smooth. Well worth a try if you�re at the brew pub.
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle shared by doulos/goodgrief as Dusseldorf alt. The pour was copper brown in color, thin off white colored head. The aroma was caramel, nuts, not enough hops, smelling kinda sticky. Flavor was better than the aroma, more balance in there, but still in need of more hops, too malt imbalanced for an alt that I prefer to be full in both. As with the Kolsch, not as clean and crisp enough, slight astringency in there too. The mouthfeel was very full for the style, moderate to light carbonation. Would like a crack on this (and the kolsch) on draft one day.
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle. Beautiful amber-brown color with one finger head and some lacing. Pretty. Funky grainy aroma that was not altogether pleasant. Smelled like it was going to be too sweet...it wasn�t. Grainy, caramel malts with a toasted/nutty presence. I was liking this. Good level of sweetness/toasty balance. Enjoyable.
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;Brown glowing pour at the brewery. Aroma is caramel, fruity esters on the nose, some spiciness. Mouthfeel is very smooth, a bit slippery. Flavors are robust fruitiness, caramel toast. Decent
Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;Labeled Dusseldorf Alt. Pours deep copper into a shaker.

Portsmouth Altbier;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Portsmouth Brewery;Deep copper/light brown in color with a small white head.

Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;(Note: tasting the 4.2% ABV 2012 version) Pours rather uneventfully flat without much head, thin ringed retention, a few visible slow streams. Burnt coffee and malts on the nose, not the good kind of burnt either... Attack: thin-bodied and watery mouthfeel, light fizzy CO2, Mid-palate: crisp 4/10-sweetness, persistent wateriness, half-roast/half-burnt coffee, malts, minor breadiness Finish: med coffee bitter finish, mostly clean but not much carry/length Average I�d say. It lacks depth and body for my liking (too watery and basic).
Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;"Deep brown, almost black colour with a small tan head. Roasted malty aroma with a heavy coffee and chocolate sweet note. Coffee bitter flavor with a vague chocolate sweetness and a hoppy note. Dry finish. Not a fan...unfortunately this suffers from the same thing as most of Big Rock�s recent offerings - no attempt to really ""own"" the style. These styles are meant to be polarizing. You either love stout and espresso or you don�t. They need to stop trying to please all the people all the time. Results in weak ass beer."
Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Pours a dark with thin white head. Aroma is mild coffee and a roasted. Taste is not really that great, some coffee but not a pleasing stout.
Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Thought this was better the first time I tried it. Smell is of roasted dark malts and moldy coffee. Taste is dark roasted malts and coffee. It�s was kinda acidy when it was cold and now that it has warmed it is far more smooth.
Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Ugh. So, you know how most stouts taste better warm? Not this one. Drinking it cold from the fridge is okay - the coffee isn�t too bad. But let it warm up, and it�s nasty. Acrid and bitter.
Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Originally reviewed Feb. 15, 2007: whoa. i had hopes for this brew for some reason. poured with no head. no lacing. aroma reminds me of dust. stale coffee bean dust. taste is reaching for the sky with an enormous amount of dull. aftertaste? it has to taste first. it wetted my mouth, but now makes me want a real beer. thats about all i can say about this. k bye.
Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;341mL bottle poured a dark brown color with thin beige head and no lacing. Aroma was espresso coffee and some chocolate. Taste is a little malty sweet with prominent coffee flavors and a trace of chocolate. Body is a little thin for this style of beer and carbonation is light. This beer would have been much better with a heavier body.
Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Bottle. 5%. This was given to me as a Christmas gift. Aroma does the job, espresso, coffee beans, mild chocolate. Pours is a dismal, earthy brown with a weak brown foam, disappointing for a stout. Flavour is fairly bland, not undrinkable but fairly unsatisfying. A novelty beer at best.
Big Rock Espresso Stout;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;The magnificent combination of coffee and stout is mostly forgotten in this Big Rock Brew. Aroma of coffee and malts. Taste is burnt coffee and malty. But overall, very bland. Dry and medium bodied. Overall, very average.

Wigram Vienna Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wigram Brewing Company;A lightly malted lager which is nice and clean. Good length (for a lager).
Wigram Vienna Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wigram Brewing Company;I�ve had this beer a couple of times before, but never rated it. I�m sorry. This is me trying to be a better person. I�ve always enjoyed that particular authentic marmitey Germanic yeast aroma that gives warm buttered toast and tangerine citrus. It�s intriguing and an aoma I would be quite happy to have as the last thing I ever smell. The colour is a gorgeous amber that lets off a rocky, fluffy white head. The fist flavours are al mandarin, tangerine and pink grapefruit and then soter tones of fresh bread and roasted hazelnuts. For all intents, this is quite a simple beer, but of a style that you don�t see terribly much of here in New Zealand. A thoroughly enjoyable drop made more enjoyable by its rarity.
Wigram Vienna Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wigram Brewing Company;500ml bottle. Rich golden orange colour, sunset in a glass with a solid level dirty white head and strong caramel malt aromas that beckon and invite you in. Well balanced malty flavour that hits all parts of the mouth. Robust and moresish . A good effort.

Wigram Vienna Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wigram Brewing Company;Tap. Nice aromas of apple and nuts. Taste is sweet, with average duration. Palate is oily, with a thin-to-medium body. Yellow, with a frothy white head.
Wigram Vienna Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wigram Brewing Company;Aaahh, the good old Vienna Lager. I wonder how many people have really tried a true Vienna Lager? This is a nice beer, well made, and would go quite nicely with a bratwurst.
Wigram Vienna Lager;Christchurch, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Wigram Brewing Company;Bottle. Clear toffee amber, medium off-white head. Initial aroma made me think of toast with maple spread. Nice toast & toffee flavour, medium bodied, nicely hopped finish of medium bitterness. Tasty, and a nice take on the style (even if they don�t use Munich malt).
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On tap at the St Louis Microfest. Not sure this is the same IPA rated by others here, since other ratings are from long ago. Pours a clear golden amber with plenty of sweet caramel malt and smooth yet assertive hop bitterness. A little grapefruit evident as well. once again, proof that aB can make a quality beer of any style, when and if the choose.
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Sampled this on two different occasions while visiting Anheuser-Busch in Merrimack, NH. This is by far my favorite beer from them. Nice copper color with an off-white head and some nice lacing. Citrusy hoppy flavor with some crisp bitterness. Nothing too great but heck, it�s pretty darn good for AB.
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Got this from a freind whos father is a distributor. Was not expecting much, and was not dissapointed. Orangey, clear pour with little to no head. almost accrid taste, mild to no hop aroma. Only thing good about this was that it finished a bit bitter which i enjoyed a bit. Not For Sale.. Good
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);(draft @ The Old Toad - Rochester, NY) Clear orange pour with not much foam. Aroma is very floral and hoppy with a light touch of sweet malts. Flavor is nice and hoppy at the beginning with a smooth and floral middle and a bitter and lightly sweet finish. Quite nice.
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);the best beer available at the n.h. brewery, nice and hoppy but the hops actually lend itself wdll to the almost spicey flavor. a slow drinker.
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Has some pretty good hops in this. The bottle says not for sale all over it. Flavor is not complex up front at all, but has a quite nice bitter finish. Quite a pleasant surprise from AB.
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On tap at the Great Lost bear. Saw a devil�s hand holding a beer and i had to try it (being reminded of Victory�s hop devil) BUT being made by AB i knew i may be in for a disappointment. This isn�t a bad beer though by any means. It�s just nothing special. It�s mostly citrus style hops, and yeah for AB it�s pretty hoppy, but not anywhere near what a hop head would be looking for. Get some cascades in here. We need more hops!
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Draught: Guest tap at Cambridge House: OK, I did go into this with an open mind. I actually didn�t mind the Winters Bourbon Ale. This was a different story. The beer pours an absolutely clearamber with a twinge of orange to it. The head was very small, and left no lacing. The aroma was a bit weak. It was mainly grassy hops, with a hint of citrus. The taste is a bit off. There was a bit of a bitterness to it, but it was definitely dumbed down. The malt body was a bit thin. There was a dryness to the aftertaste. There was also a bit of a staleness and harshness to the taste. This had to be part of the profile and not being old, since this was tapped last night for a tasting sponsered by A-B and had never left the refrigerator. I have heard that the production recipe is different from the prototype that they put out earlier. What happened to the days of when AB put out Elk Mountain, which actually was half decent. I definitely won�t be buying this one again.
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);On tap - Barking Crab. Pours clear amber into a shaker. Micro head slowly dissipates leaving no lacing. Mild bread and citrus aromas. Very little flavor -- what is there is a mild hop with a lasting off-bitter finish. Sort of non-descript...didn�t order a second.
Anheuser-Busch Demons Hop Yard IPA;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;IPA;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I was disappointed that I did not hate it ... given that it is from A-B and given that the name was originally offensively close to some beers that I really do like, like Victory Hop Devil. Looks good ... a clean, clear golden ale with a small white head. Tastes good ... malt, bitter hops, with some orange citrus. Mouth is thin, but not offensively so. Bitter finish. Not great, but the best Bud I�ve ever had.
White Marsh Nut Brown Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Tap at the brewpub. Pours an amber woody brown with an ok head. Aroma is a big ass butter-bomb- diacetyl is fairly strong in this one- light nutty roasted malts, chocolate and biscuit-. Flavor is light char, nutty, toast, roast, too much butter, slight mineral and toffee in the end. Slick finish from the diacetyl. Eh.
White Marsh Nut Brown Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Brown Ale;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Definitely brown but not particularly nutty. Was ok, had a little bit of malt and caramel flavor, but was overly watery and boring. Got tired of it after a few sips.

Kelburn CaCanny (Bottle);Glasgow, Strathclyde, Scotland;Old Ale;Kelburn Brewery;Dark red with thick head which obscures the aroma. When it dissipates, the aroma is of molasses. Sour and thin, with a hint of lactose on the back. It is strangely thin for such a dark beer.

Cedar Mountain Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;12 oz. can into plastic cup. No need to go crazy upscale! Aroma: None.

Town Hall Palisades Golden Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Draft, 2006 GTM. Mild hop aroma.

Town Hall Palisades Golden Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Nice Gold Color with White Head. Light Herbal/Floral Aroma. Clean Crisp and Lightly Sweet Tasting Brew...Nice Dry Hop Bite with Good Malt Foundation. Great Summer Session Ale.
Town Hall Palisades Golden Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Light hazy gold. Nose some pine, rather grassy, smells like I�m sitting in a field. Nothing particularly unusual, some floral and pine hops, very sharp and dry at the end.
Town Hall Palisades Golden Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;GTMW 06. Cask sample. Hazy pale with white head. The aroma is herbal and bready. The flavor is floral, spicey and bready, fairly dry. The mouthfeel is light and soft.
Town Hall Palisades Golden Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;The colour is pale gold with some murkiness. The aroma is thin but what is there I felt was mostly a gin like pine. The flavour was pretty up front with the hops, there wasn�t a big mix of malts in there but I felt the tilt towards lght malts did a good job of keeping up. I think that overall this beer is much better than its individual parts. Good mix of flavours with a nice twist on a standard style.
Town Hall Palisades Golden Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Fresh Growler: Lighter shade of gold, clear body and bright with a stark white firmly set foam of about a finger high. Super nice lacing with droopy sheetings and broken stringy tentacles. Aroma is not as forward as it could be as its light to medium in tone with a high pine wood tones laced with a dry parching-like citrus. Wow, this has some big time hop bite. Hold on to your taste buds cuz they won�t last long with this stuff. Flavorwise its not the greatest as its unbalanced with very light malt. Toasty and quick, with dry, woody, brittle, bitterness ensuing largely through the finish with a parching, acidic dryness of wood carving scraps, dust, and the metal bits from the dremel. Overly hoppy and thensome. To those who can handle it, all the best; as for me this was far too unbalanced for my tastes and actually not all that flavorfull besides its dry woody parched stuff. The thinnest of thin citrus pith makes up some of the parching soured action but this is uncomplexing and not a whole lot of balance. Feel is dry, and quick to it at that, hard to enjoy it when it squeezes every corpuscle of your mouth dry within the first third of the glass. Body is medium and fluffy and tends to get lessened a bit in its hoppy girth as it sits as far as how fast it enters in. But the finish is built upon one very hoppy foundation of mouth quenching soured, dry bitterness its nearly unsippable. Not a fav of the single hop pales from Town Hall. Give me more balance and I would probably like it more. Its a bit too hoppy, even for this hophead. Scary stuff."
Town Hall Palisades Golden Pale Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Once more into the single hop series, this time with Palisades and again eschewing caramel malts for lighter varieties. From a growler, after several pints at the pub. Pours a lightly hazed golden tone, with an ample serving of snow-white foam on top, lasting long into the life of the pint. Sharp pine and prickly citrus in the nose, but not too loud, rather refined. On the palate, it�s crisp, dry and terrifically hoppy. A bit brittle up front, some grit and grab in the texture, plays well in the mouth. Some citrus and tropical fruit, mingled with grassy feel. Considerable malt, too, but not adding to the flavor, as far as I can tell. Besides the fierce hop presence, this is a remarkably light and refreshing pale ale. Goes down easy, but the hopheads are more than happy. Fresh, vibrant hop attack starts at the lips and glides down the throat. This is another excellent ale...you�d think we�d get complacent from Town Hall�s consistently solid output, but it�s still astonishing how many great, great brews come from that tiny room back there!
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle. Golden yellow in color with no head. Spicy boozy aroma. Fruity appley flavor. Very hot. Dry. Not good. Finish is appley and dry. Ok.
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle shared by EDA. Pours golden yellow. Extremly astringent on the nose, with honey and apple coming out. Apple? I don�t get it. Anywho, this one was very boozy and somewhat buttery, to go along with that odd apple taste. Where did the honey go in this mead? Minerally as well with no carbonation at all. Not a good start for the mead category.
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle shared by EDA. Boozy, clove aroma, way too hot. A bit of an odd bite, stinging bee honey. Totally dried out. As it warms, it becomes worse and worse, and eventually becomes undrinkable. Yuck.
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;"Bottle, thanks EDA. Clear, soft yellow in appearance; like white grape juice. The aroma is earthy honey, and the flavor is the same. Dry kind of like white wine."
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;Pale straw colour. Absolutely still. Aroma is mostly of wildflower honey. Dusty, dry palate. Light astringency. Flabby and flat. Buh.
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;Thanks to EDA for sharing - Wow, even the name of this stuff sucks - clear gold - alcoholic aroma, with medium honey sweetness and not much else - apples and alcohol in the flavor - some dry white wine character tries to make it interesting, but this is mostly astringent and medicinal.
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle. Smells like fermented apples. Taste is worse with a medicinal rotten apple taste. Fuckin awful.
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;At the pub. This stuff was terrible. Mead is one of my favorite styles and this is simply a poor example of this wonderful drink. Light yellow in color, with a faint honey aroma. The flavor was very thin and the taste was musty and stale. A horrible experience.
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;Bottle from the brew pub: Pours a clear light goldish color. Aroma is of honey and some spicing. Flavor, has a weak honey character, dry, but suffers from being thin and boozy. Listed as 10% I believe, and for a mead I wouldn�t think that would be over powering, but it is.
Dragonmead Dragons Mead;Warren, Michigan, United States;Mead;Dragonmead Brewery;Cidery type of mead, a little lace, thinnish body and light honeyish colour. Advance tasting at the pub since I am Canadian. Some honey in the smell and alcohol, though not too bad

Tennessee Valley Winery Attitude Mead;Loudon, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Tennessee Valley Winery;Bottle from Nachlamsie, a very generous trader and nice guy. Must visit Tennessee someday. Light pale yellow color. The appearance would be terrible if it were a beer, but OK for a mead. Light sweetness, similar to most meads. Some honey in the aroma. A hint of sulphur. I have a huge sweet tooth, and thus I love meads. Very nice. Great with some Brie.
Tennessee Valley Winery Attitude Mead;Loudon, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Tennessee Valley Winery;Pretty darn tasty stuff. Pour pale yellow, with some legs on the side of the glass. Aroma is honey, as one might suspect, mixed with subtle vanilla and, I don�t know, pear? Flavor is honey, again, but not cloying or tedious. Surprsingly dryish finish. Pretty good.
Tennessee Valley Winery Attitude Mead;Loudon, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Tennessee Valley Winery;Bottle split with Tronraner. Pours still and yellow with a noticeable viscosity. The aroma is honey (duh) delivered in a tart, musty scent. I�m most impressed with the flavor. Behind the honey is a rounded oak note. Any tartness in the mead moves gracefully from the front of the palate to be covered by a very appropriate level of honey-sweetness. The alcohol is not apparent at all. Amazing. This is my favorite mead so far, but I haven�t had that many yet. [Sept 17, 2007] Revisited this one. It�s still as good as I remembered. It doesn�t have the deep floral complexity found in some central European meads, but it has its own nuances. I found more subtle vinous notes and strong suggestions of muscadines this time around. The honey is appropriate and this never cloys. The alcohol is completely hidden.
Tennessee Valley Winery Attitude Mead;Loudon, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Tennessee Valley Winery;Bottle. Pours a crystalline yellow, very still. It leaves well-defined legs, but they fall quite fast. The aroma is that of a musty cellar and wildflowers, with some clear wafts of sweet honey. The flavor is quite well-blended. Lots of mild oak character balances the sweetness of the honey and a very delicate floral character lurks behind everything. The finish is tart but subtle and fades slowly into a warm aftertaste. The palate is particularly smoothly textured. I like this mead a lot.
Bluegrass Pappy VanWinkle Bourbon Stout;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout;Bluegrass Brewing Company;On tap in Louisville, I forget the name of the pub. Nice, creamy thick body with rich sweet flavors of molasses, caramel and vanilla. Oaky, boozy aroma and finish. Nice thick head, a lot of fun and a nice change.
Bluegrass Pappy VanWinkle Bourbon Stout;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout;Bluegrass Brewing Company;tap at the brewpub. Pours black with red on the edges & a fat gray head that had a large clear bubble sticking out of it like a big fish eye that I watched for a few minutes until it popped. Smells of chocolate syrup, licorice, raisins, a bit of alcohol. Taste is strong raisin, with chocolate, and some fudge notes. Very sweet. Sticky finish with a cocoa & raisin finish with a lot of licorice. This is too cloying for me. Ap-3 ar-6 tas-5 pal-2 ov-11
Bluegrass Pappy VanWinkle Bourbon Stout;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Opaque black with foamy tan head. Complex, attractive nose with vanilla, brown sugar, chocolate, and bourbon. Kind of like chocolate chip cookie dough with a bit of bourboun mixed in. Flavor is equally alluring, again with the chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla, but also an assertive, but not cloying, oak note. Roasty and slightly sweet finish. Good to the last drop.
Whats Brewing Pale Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Whats Brewing Company;Straw coloured body with a fluffy white head. Some lacing. Fruity aroma with sweet malts. A little yeast in the taste along with some apricot, a little too unbalanced for me to have more than one.
Whats Brewing Pale Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Whats Brewing Company;Had this on tap at a couple of places around Melbourne now, pours cloudy golden... much like a coopers pale. Creamy white head. Soft, fruity aroma... quite generic bit you cant really fault it. A touch of green hops, a light splattering of sweet cereal malts and some herbal notes too. Body is as middle ground as you can get, its one you could drink all night, soft, hoppy enough to be interesting and herbal, and malty enough to give a light grainy sweetness on the back of the tongue. Maybe its drier in the finish, a touch of dried apricot or something. Not going to win any awards for creativity, but overall its pretty faultless and gets a very high drinkability score from me.
Whats Brewing Pale Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Whats Brewing Company;19 Jul 2006 - (Victorian Microbrewer�s Showcase) - Very light sweet fruit malt aroma. Amber colour, OK head and lacing. Simple light sweet malt hop flavour. Plain malt and hop finish.
Whats Brewing Pale Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Whats Brewing Company;"Another decent effort from What�s. glowing orange apricot in the glass with a thin patchy head. Fruity note with added complexity via spicy ginger / nettle note - nice. Steps down a notch in the palate as the malts don�t really make their presence felt. Quite dry with decent hop input, again herbal and spicy, although I should stress ""elegant"" in terms of flavour intensity. Medium length finish with some confectionary like malts finally making an appearance."
Whats Brewing Amber Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Whats Brewing Company;Good size fluffy white head on an amber body. Pleasant aroma, I mainly notice the hops which seem to carry well through to the taste, on a fairly thin body. After just having a JS Amber after work I found this easier to drink.
Whats Brewing Amber Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Whats Brewing Company;Hazy dark golden with a large off-white head. Very nutty/estery aroma, bit of solvent alcohol too. Also had some biscuit and sugary sweetness, a bit strange really. Pretty abrasive mouthful, extremely tannic, not sure if its too bitter... its so hard to tell. Flavours of toffee and nuts and those little sweet corn treats. I didn�t really enjoy it too much, especially compared to their pale.
Whats Brewing Amber Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Whats Brewing Company;don�t know if it is the rating bottle, but it is not as nice as i remember from the microbrewers showcase. Anyway, very simple nose, pours with a nice white head and amber body as one would expect. Flavour is quite straighforward with toffee/caramel malts upfront and some decent bitterness in the finish. Not bad, but nothing too memorable either. there was also a slight hint of sourness. perhaps worth re-rating later as this may be a slightly sub-par batch.
Whats Brewing Amber Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Whats Brewing Company;19 Jul 2006 - (Victorian Microbrewer�s Showcase) - Light sweet simple malt and fruit aroma. Amber colour with a tinge of red colour, ordinary head and suds lacing. Wierd hop and light sweet ordinary flavour. Bitter hop and thin malt finish. Overall - I�d like to try this again in a better surrounding.
Whats Brewing Amber Ale;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Whats Brewing Company;Uninspiring upon pouring with effectively no head. Amber / light brown in colour. Soft malts with a touch of sweet caramel on the nose, not unlike a English bitter. Quite appealing. Very similar to taste although the malt weight doesn�t really get out of 2nd gear. Some firming bitterness on the finish. Quite low in fizz and probably all the better for it. Had I drunk blind I would definately have picked it as a UK bitter. Not bad for a relatively new member on the Melbourne craft scene.
Whats Brewing Porter;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Porter;Whats Brewing Company;Compact tan head on a dark muddy brown body. Notice the alcohol in the aroma then dried fruit. Rich dark chocolate in the taste with not too much else.
Whats Brewing Porter;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Porter;Whats Brewing Company;Pours a very muddy brown with a tiny tan head. Aroma of chocolate malt, quite dominating with some high plummy esters and herbs (rosemary?) underneath. Full enough body, flavours of cheap cola, nutella spread, and more beer nuts, doesnt really work for me... but could go down as the nuttiest beer I�ve ever tried. Full roasty (nut) finish, like a rich chocolate cake. Not bad by any means.
Whats Brewing Porter;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Porter;Whats Brewing Company;19 Jul 2006 - (Victorian Microbrewer�s Showcase) - Roasted malt and sweet aroma. Nice dark brown colour, good head and sheet lacing. Weird roasted malt start, medicinal flavour an I am not convinced. Finishs with a roasted malt and sweet tangy aftertaste.
Whats Brewing Porter;Geelong, Vic, Australia;Porter;Whats Brewing Company;Perhaps the least impressive of the 3 What�s Brewing beers but this is no disaster. Dirty tan brown in colour like filthy dish washing water, kinda unique and certainly different. Milk chocolate roast nose, a touch smokey and acidic (ie burning wood). Like the other beers the palate doesn�t quite live up to the promise of the bouquet. In this case some mild roast notes are offset but a faint metallic, iron like note. Needs a lot more omph (ie obvious sweet notes) although I do appreciate the beer is not necessarily chasing stout-like palate weight.
Burton Bridge California Dreamin;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Cask @ Chelmsford BF06: A bit thin and flat. Copper colour. Fruity, mild citric hops. A bit boring really. Certainly lacks californian hop flavours.

Curious Brew Cobb IPA;Ashford, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Curious Brewing;"33cl bottle from Chapel Down Winery, Tenterden. Gold with a fast fading white head; fresh, delicate spicy hop aromas; rich a nd syrupy in the mouth without being sweet, some good chewy malts, spicy hops and some warming dry alcohol. Excellent."
Curious Brew Cobb IPA;Ashford, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Curious Brewing;A Mes rate: bottle thanks very kindly to Vicky. There is no denying it is a good looking beer. Rich amber with a good off white head and really well conditioned. I�m pleasantly surprised to find I actually rather like this. Good Kentish hoppage with some delicate spice and a solid malt base. Faint sweet bready notes too. A very slight hint of cardboard but the hops kick it out of the way without any fuss. Good length to the dry bitter finish. Drinkable and balanced. Thanks V!
Curious Brew Cobb IPA;Ashford, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Curious Brewing;Bottle thanks to Mes shared with the both of them. Aroma is balanced, smells slightly pasturiesed cardboard character, but mainly earthy grassy hop with balancing malts. Taste is similar, quite drinkable stuff.
Curious Brew Cobb IPA;Ashford, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Curious Brewing;Bottle. Poured a light amber colour, with small white. Plenty of hop aroma with notes of fruit. Clean and sweet in the mouth, with a dry finish. Not sure if i liked this beer.
Curious Brew Cobb IPA;Ashford, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Curious Brewing;Bottle at home ... Rich amber ... sweet orangy little hop nose ... little fizz ... fruity orangy medicinal tones ... quite rich ... bitter hop linger... seems unbalanced.
Curious Brew Cobb IPA;Ashford, Kent, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Curious Brewing;Bottle. Pours clear & deep amber with a medium off-white head. Quite ordinary toffeish malt aroma with some mild and herbal hop character. Medium bodied. Well balanced and a long bitter finish. Ok but not very interesting.
Bastone Red;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bastone Brewery;On-tap at the brewpub. A new addition by Rockne, with craftmanship and good yeast and hop ingrediants.

Taste: crisp, clean, light malty feel, bready, but plenty hoppy too...and still missing something in the mouthfeel, something substantial lacks in the body...not bad for a not-bad beer, but I�d want something extra...an easy-to-drink beer, custom made for a all-purpose gathering...not the sort I�d choose for a beer for my own, but a nice brew to share with those of less driscriminatin� tastes...crisp, hoppy, malty, dry...that�s the order...a clean, lean, stripped-down brew....does taste rather like an alt, but an extra-hoppy version...not that I mind."
Glentworth Chinooker;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;Cask. Aroma of hops. Not much else, but a nice balanced hop nose. Taste is not much, but some citrus in the taste, bitter hoppy finish. Nice blonde if there�s nothing better on offer.
Glentworth Bobby Dazzler;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;On tap at the Clangers, Waddington. Now at 4.3%. Pale golden colour with a crisp white head. Fruity, and slight citrus aroma. Taste sweetish fruit. Slight hoppy bitterness.
Glentworth Bobby Dazzler;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;Not a great ale. Some slight carbonation. Pours blonde with a small white head. Hoppy, summer fruity ale, dried fruits. Taste is fruity, summer fruits, not a great deal of it. Some slight hoppy bitterness. I should try this again at some point, as I don�t think this was the best pint.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle shared by jimmack at Paul�s Thanksgiving weekend bash. Poured a marmalade orange body with a small foamy off white head. Aroma of rye bread, bread crusts, orange citrus and dough. Thin watery body with some astringent carbonation. Flavor of rye seeds, bread, bread crust, orange and lemon pulp. Solid beer and actually pretty darn good for how old this one was.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle at Paul�s tasting. Pours a lightly hazed golden orange with a thin white head. Caraway and rye, toast and oxidized malt. Toast, spicy citrus and rye. Sweet and toast. Lots of rye. This has held up very well.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle shared by Jimmack at Paul�s gathering. Pours light caramel color. Nose and taste of literally a slice of rye bread - pumpernickel, rye, bread and caraway seed. Very solid for its age.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle shared by JCB. Nice! This beer was a bit past its prime but still very fun to drink. Nose showed some light tartness (sour apple), fading rye malts, bread, a bit of caraway, mild oxidation. Flavor is a bit more tart than the nose, slightly bready, but this has lost most of its unique character in my opinion. Would have loved to try this fresh.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;750ml from Cornboy - thanks, John! Man, I am so happy to finally try this beer. Thankfully, it�s held up far better than other HWs of this vintage (Cornboy must have stored it perfectly!). Nice dingy brown pour, kind of like an oud bruin if not for the bits of orange at the edges. Cloudy with yeast, tart nose with mild oxidation. Tart sour apples in the nose, some mild berry. Taste is lovely sour brown with the rye and caraway giving a still detectable twist to the bready goodness. Medieval beer, yo.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Bottle shared by JCB, who is the king of rounding up retired Heavyweight beers and sharing them. And he thinks we hang out with him because we actually like him! Pours bright amber orange with an active off-white head. Nose is like sticking your face in a bread bag. Inhaling inside that bread bag (only once or twice so as not to suffocate), some caraway notes add to the rye malt nose, and there is quite a bit of tart yeast. The taste is quite tart. Odd, but still complex. Bet this was awesome when a bit more fresh.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Thanks JCB for sharing. Pours a hazy amber with a one to two finger frothy offwhite head. The nose was showed some caraway, malty, mildly sweet, some oxidation, bready for sure, malty, Held up better to age than I thought it would have. The flavor is a little tart/sour, oxidized, malty, crisp/spicy, bready, some sweetness. Palate is crisp and spicy. Nice.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;Thanks to JCB for sharing this gem. I have to admit im quite surprised by some of the low rates here. I also think this was stored at optimal conditions because it was holding up extremely well! Hazy dull orange pour with a fluffy tan head and spotty lace. Bread, juniper berries & some slight signs of oxidation on the nose. Bread, yeast, spice, and slightly acidic
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;[Bottle] shared by Tyler. Pours a cloudy orange with a large beige head. Aroma is bready yeast, slight orange, a little fruity, minerally, gravelly hard water, and some spices. Flavor is really thin and remarkably absent. There is a touch of tartness and yeast on the finish followed by the minerally hard water taste.
Heavyweight Slice of Bread;Ocean Township, New Jersey, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Heavyweight Brewing Company;(bottle shared by tytoanderso, thanks Tyler!) Pours hazy orange with a white head. Aroma is certainly muted, but what is there is some spicy rye, ample must and staleness. The flavor is almost non-existent until the mid-palate reveals a spike of tartness that settles into a lightly dry and bread-like finish. The mouthfeel is medium and that carbonation is very lively. A neat idea for sure, but this bottle is past its prime.
High & Mighty Beer of the Gods;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;High & Mighty Beer Co;With Z, pours a hazy light golden yellowish color with a foamy white head. Wheaty and grainy, and honey like nose. Taste is very grainy and salty with some honey notes. This reminds me to stay with IPAs and stouts. Quaff Score 4 / 10
High & Mighty Beer of the Gods;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;High & Mighty Beer Co;Bomber. Pours a golden yellow with a white head and aroma of grains and malt. Taste is of grains and malt, with some honey and bread notes leading to a malty finish.
High & Mighty Beer of the Gods;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;High & Mighty Beer Co;Pours pale gold with a quickly vanishing head. A grassy, hoppy aroma.

High & Mighty Beer of the Gods;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;High & Mighty Beer Co;Bottle. Clear golden, small head. Hay and grainy notes in aroma. Grainy notes, some bitterness and subtle garden fruityness in taste. Unpleasant bitterness in aftertaste at first, got slightly better later on with some fruityer notes though.
High & Mighty Beer of the Gods;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;High & Mighty Beer Co;12 oz. bottle 2014. Light, endearing touch. Firm but fair mouthfeel. Mild friction in the mineral bed body. Soft pineapple water spiked with dried apricot. More oval than round.
High & Mighty Beer of the Gods;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;High & Mighty Beer Co;Pours a slightly hazy golden body with the yeast appearing a distinct heavy clumps on the bottom of the glass. The head is white, nice and frothy and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Nose is mild with some citrus fruits, wheatand yeast. Taste is bitter with some sourness to it, the finish is mildly bitter and decently long. Carbonation is lively and the palate is average. Overall decent but lacks a little character and distinction.
High & Mighty Beer of the Gods;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;High & Mighty Beer Co;On tap at Battleship. Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a medium white head that lasts. Aroma is of straw, bread, grass, minerals, clove, and perfume. The flavor is absolutely identical. Has a big earthiness flavor.

Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Pours a hazy orange. Nose and taste is almost all citrus and peel. Overall, a pleasant beer, but seriously lacking any kind of complexity. Also, not very bitter for an ESB.
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Bottle and one your would only buy if you were ticking. Pours a golden body with a white head. Some light fruity tones, citrus and lemon accents. Dusty and with a dank wood note. Finishes tart and spicy with a pepper and lemongrass finish. okay.
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Hazy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Apple cider nose. Flavor is sour apple cider without the expected hops from a bitter, one has to question if this bottle has gone bad but after reading other reviews apparently it hasn�t, even though it hasn�t been brewed since 2006. $4.49 for a 500ml bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT.
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Pint bottle - Poured a hazy light ice tea color with little head. Citrus on the nose and a sour bitterness on the pallet. Yeast and hops with a grassy sourness that makes me want to kick this Jezebel out the door. Not a Premium Bitter for me!
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Bottle. Aroma of flowers and grass. hazy red color with a yellowish head. taste was mostly sweet and earthy.little bit of orange peel and lemon. Also a bit sour. Thought this was odd for the style but I liked it non the less.
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);1pt+ bottle from 6-Pack And Subs, Lancaster, PA...pours cloudy amber color, no head...faint mustly floral aroma, taste was sour, some citrus notes, tart, fizzy...first few sips were pretty good, kind of refreshing, but the whole bottle was a bit much...can�t say I liked it too much.
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Half liter bottle (bottle conditioned!). Slightly sour citric aroma. A belgian? Less than clear amber tinged gold color with a decent white head. Medium body with fizzy carbonation - but soft carbonation. It�s a bit lactic. Earthy. Must be interesting hop, cause there�s a fair amount of bitter. The sour smooths into the finish. It�s now that the fruity ESB comes forth to balance against some roasted malt. But such a strange journey to get there. As consumption continues, the sour works out, and becomes a background thing. Wicked it is.
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);500 ml bottle. hazy golden beer with a thick tight white head. There is a fairly leathery aroma that first presents itself. A fairly tart citric acidity along with lots of dry dusty leathey aroma. A herbal tartness with strange notes of lemongrass and a hint of oak/wood. Quite sweaty. I�m not sure if this is supposed to taste like this, or if it�s infected. Sometimes these infections work, but I don�t think this one does. There is a bit of earthiness and a pithy bitterness. Lemon skin tartness. An indescribable fruitiness (maybe kiwi or gooseberry?). Strange brew here.
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Bottle sampled. Pours golden with an average-large beige head. Aroma of fruit, yeast, spices, and herbal hops. The flavor is citrus, spices, fruit, herbal, and finishes with a slight bitterness.
Brewster's Jezebel;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brewster's Brewery (UK);"Note: I love this label and Brewster�s ""Wicked Women"" Series. Mid-golden, lightly headed in off-white on a vigorous pour. Fuggles come sharply off the top with cut grass clippings (wet grass that has been sitting in a plastic bin for a few days). Very sour flavor, I believe from the hops and not from yeasts, which is usually the case. Very lemony... lemongrass... lemon iced tea. Dry bitters in the finish. Takes some getting used to, but it can turn out to be enjoyably unique. Pint bottle from Oliver�s Beverage, Albany, NY 12208"

Lord Nelson Royal Red;Sydney, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel;"on tap at the hop factory in newcastle, as lord nelson royal red. i wouldn�t have picked this as an altbier - ruby red with a modest head; plenty of nougat in the aroma, slightly tinny hop character, modest bitterness; disappeared without me noticing it much which isn�t all a bad thing"
Lord Nelson Royal Red;Sydney, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel;Taster at GABS Melbourne 220515. Not sure if this is the same beer that I had as it was listed as an Irish Red Ale and weighed in at 4.2% ABV.

Lord Nelson Royal Red;Sydney, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel;On tap at the Local Taphouse. Intense malty nose, with good hop support. Aromas of caramel, nuts, with hints of smoke. Taste is sweet, with bitter notes, and average length. Palate is oily, and medium bodied. Orange, with a frothy head.
Lord Nelson Royal Red;Sydney, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel;On tap at the Lord Nelson. Arrived hazy copper with a small, frothy white, head which was mostly lasting. Aroma was of black berries and crane berries with light earthy notes, biscuity malts and toffee. Flavor was similar to aroma with a light earthy hop bitterness, dry biscuity malts, caramel, cranberries and a nutty/dry finish. Light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, a dry/creamy mouthfeel and an ok finish.
Lord Nelson Royal Red;Sydney, Australia;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Lord Nelson Brewery Hotel;Following a meeting in the city I decided it was about time I made the trip down to the Lord. A good walk to build up a thirst for a pint before returning to work. So, to my delight, prior of course to drinking the beer, I found a new offering. Look, to be fair, this is one of the old stagers of the craft brew scene here in Sydney and so we need to be thankful that they were pioneers of a sort. Brewers, regrettably, have come and gone, and so there is a little inconsistency that has crept into the brews. So, to the new beer. The first hurdle is of course procuring the relevant information from the bar staff. What style is this? �Errr beer (duuuhhh)�, said pretty young brunette with preppy hairdo and an attitude to match. No, I assume its an ale but what style? �Ale style, like you said�. OK, forget any further inquisition think I. This is a beer with a reddish hue and crema head that suggested an Irish red with its biscuity nose and understated hop aroma. The flavour is similar but the most noticeable aspect of this is the unpleasant sharpness in the finish accompanied by a harsh bitterness. In attempting to tie this style down I asked one of the longer serving people there who at least recognises me on a tip of the lid basis. He pointed me out to the brewer Damon, who should be able to help. Well, at about 1:30 in the afternoon I felt that he had at least been diligent in ensuring quality control of his craft as he was certainly emulating one of the brews there by being at least 3 sheets to the wind. He babbled something about challenger, saaz and fuggles hops being in the mix and that this was a sort of an altbier, but he was just having a play around. A bit. Uh, yeah cheers sport, you have made an ordinary and confused beer which goes to show you are who brewed you.

Orlando Brewing Organic Blonde Ale;Orlando, Florida, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Orlando Brewing Company;It is essentially as tasteless as a Budweiser. Their website lists it as 6 IBU. Coors Light has more flavor than this beer. Might be good for summer BBQs and such where one would normally consume macro-lagers. I had some Lagunitas IPA on hand, so I did this- To one bottle of this swill, I added in 1/3 a bottle of Lagunitas. It wound up tasting freakin� great after that. That easily doubled the flavor. Try it out, You will freak out on how good it tastes. Come on Florida, you can do better than this! Weak.

Jack of the Wood Merlin Tripel;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Tripel;Jack of the Wood Brewpub;Draught. Pours fairly dark for the style. It�s orange with a nice looking white head. The nose is full of apple, honey, and bubblegum. Man, this stuff is sticky sweet and heavy on the nutmeg. Coriander, cloves, apples are present. The sweetness is gummy. The alcohol is hidden well. I would not say this is the best Tripel ale.
Jack of the Wood Merlin Tripel;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Tripel;Jack of the Wood Brewpub;Draught at the brewpub. Pours orange gold with retentive white head.

The flavor is a bit bland, with a medium hoppy finish that has nothing to back it up.
Green Man Extra Pale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Green Man Brewery;"Draught. Pours a golden copper color with no real head. The nose is quite meek, but some apples and corn are noticed. Though it is darker and maltier than most ""extra pale"" ales, it is by no means robust, nor tasty for that matter. Vegetal notes are abound in this brew. Some pea-taste and stale hay are noticed. This is not good. Jack of the Wood is fairly inconsistent on their brews and I certainly wouldn�t seek out anything titled ""extra pale ale"" anyway."

Cains Creamy Stout;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Stout;Cains;Cask at GBBF 2006. This was actually my rating number 7000, if I�d put them in chronologically. A pitch black beer with a brown head. The aroma is sweet malty and quite roasted. The flavor is sweet with a strong dry malty roasted note, combined with light notes of chocolate, but the body is thin. Nice flavor - but lacking body.
Cains Creamy Stout;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Stout;Cains;Cask, Turf Tavern, Oxford. Brown high-lighted black, small layer of dark tan bubbles. Toffee and butterscotch aroma, some coffee that sat around cold a bit long. Coffee flavor, some cigarette butt and ocean. Starts okay, but gets less good with further exploration.
Cains Creamy Stout;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Stout;Cains;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Near black with a bubbly beige head. Sweet malty aroma, slightly fishy. Taste certainly isn�t �full-flavoured�: there�s some sweet malt with a resiny sort of background, and a faint bitter finish. An unusual stout whose component parts don�t really work together.
Cains Creamy Stout;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Stout;Cains;Cask (handpump), GBBF 2006, Day 2, August 2006. Deep mahogany colour. Not the darkest stout I�ve seen. Creamy alright, with a big head.

Grand Union One Hop: Aurora;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask (handpump) at the Market Porter, Southwark, June 2006. The usual Grand Union One Hop pale gold colour. Moderate citric aroma. the citrus really kicks in on the palate, with lashings of grapefruit, coupled with a subtle underlying dry malt touch to provide balance. Finishes sharp and quite bitter. I thought this was an excellent summer quaffer, although not the most complex (although I wouldn�t expect that from this concept). It would indeed, as the brewery suggests, be interesting to compare and contrast beers in this series side by side, but that�s not really on option because of the monthly release format. Still, its an interesting, and largely successful, concept.
Grand Union One Hop: Aurora;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask @ Market Porter: Hoppy, grassy aroma with some grapefruit there. Very refreshing juicy grapefruit and citric hops. Almost a touch of pine. Nice golden ale.
Grand Union One Hop: Aurora;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask conditioned at the Market Porter, Southwark. A standard issue golden ale with some malt upfront and a slightly brash late bitterness. It�s quite good but there�s not an awful lot going on.
Fernandes Explorer;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fernandes Brewery (Ossett);Cask (handpump) at the Market Porter, Southwark, June 2006. A light, golden bitter - style that Fernandes is rather fond of. Very pale straw colour in fact. Distinctly hoppy aroma, with the emphasis on herbaceous, grassy character. Light tangy, spicy notes beneath. Less on the palate. Dry, but rather short of flavour. This leaves the mouthfeel a touch thin. A decent enough summer quencher though.
Fernandes Explorer;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fernandes Brewery (Ossett);Cask @ Market Porter: Thin, dry feel. Light golden colour. Simple grassy hops. Drinkable, quite refreshing but a little thin.
Fernandes Explorer;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fernandes Brewery (Ossett);Cask conditioned at the Market Porter, Southwark.

Okells Honda Blade Brew;Douglas, Isle of Man;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Okells;Cask at The Red Lion, Cricklade 09-06-07 Wiltshire. Poured amber colour with reddy hues. I tended to note more malt than fragrant floral aroma, then it was more malt vinegar as Butch our bus driver sat near me drowned his chips in the stuff. This was a tasty beer with good bitterness and some nice toffee undecurrents but not for the first time today was one of many beers that were far too safe and a bit boring.
Okells Honda Blade Brew;Douglas, Isle of Man;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Okells;Cask (handpump) at the Market Porter, Southwark, June 2006. More amber, tending towards copper, than gold in colour. I didn�t find much evidence of the fragrance referred to in the commercial description. The hop element was rather moist and clammy with some sulphurous notes. Perhaps a bit green. Better definition on the palate. Tangy hops, dry and fairly bitter. Tends towards astringency on the finish, but doesn�t stray too far in that direction, leaving a crisp and quite sharp aftertaste. A decent, relatively straightforward bitter.
Okells Honda Blade Brew;Douglas, Isle of Man;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Okells;Cask conditioned at the Market Porter, Southwark. Disgusting rotten egg aroma at first, which half burns off but still is rather unpleasant until the bottom. Cloudy orange appearance. Sweet malt with some beef and hops. Better than the aroma suggests.
Hogs Back Englands Glory;Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask at Swan, Farnborough. 4.4% ABV. Vague malty aroma. Amber brown. Creamy White head but blotchy. Hmmm... surprisingly sweet and fruity. A definite sugar hit. Some sourness I to the finish. Light bodied. Thin but benefits from a soft carbonation. Abrupt finish. Actually rather enjoying this. Not the bland bitter In was expecting - where are the twigs?
Marston Moor Gamekeepers Glory;York, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rudgate Brewery;Cask (handpump) at the Market Porter, Southwark, June 2006. Marston Moor was one of the earlier UK micros but ceased brewing in about 2000, contracting out its brews to Rudgate. In 2004, Rudgate bought the company, but the beers live on in name only. This was a mid brown beer, rather cloudy, with a big creamy head. Whether it was down to the head or the beer itself, I struggled to get any aroma whatsoever. On the palate there�s some bitterness, but not much else, and the finish is dry with some tart acidity. A rather nondescript basic bitter which seemed rather tired (a trait I�ve noticed before at the Market Porter) and not in peak condition .
Marston Moor Gamekeepers Glory;York, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rudgate Brewery;Cask conditioned at the Market Porter, Southwark. A brown bitter with thick white head. Lacks almost any aroma, there might be a tiny bit of sweet dishwater. To taste this IS sweet dishwater, with the slightest hop character. It looks like, smells like and tastes like John Smiths. It may as well be John Smiths!
Put-In-Bay Ole Cotton Top Irish Red;Put In Bay, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Put-In-Bay Brewing Company;Draft @ PIB: To its only credit, this beer was a beautiful reddish-amber. Perhaps soapy glass, but there was virtually no head here. Aroma of apple, some bready malt. Highly carbonated with only traces of toasted malts and a syrupy finish. Wouldn�t really ever buy this.
Put-In-Bay Ole Cotton Top Irish Red;Put In Bay, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Put-In-Bay Brewing Company;I am usually afraid of micros with no head and few bubbles and this one confirmed my fear. It had a funky taste that reminded me of Malto.

Put-In-Bay Ole Cotton Top Irish Red;Put In Bay, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Put-In-Bay Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brew pub 8/10/07. I LOVE Irish Reds. This one poured a nice amber color, with a nice foamy head. Sweet smell of malts and grains. Taste was sweet caramel right away, then followed by another bad funky taste that was present in all three beers from this brewer. It really tasted as if the beer was contaminated. Left a horrible after taste in my mouth. I did not finish this beer either. VERY disappointed in this brewer.
Put-In-Bay Ole Cotton Top Irish Red;Put In Bay, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Put-In-Bay Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub 6/26/06 - Pours deep copper in color with a light tan head that faded pretty quick. Aroma of light grassy and floral hops over light caramel malts. Flavor is caramel, some light peach flavor, a bit of the wet cardboard, and some more light hops on the finish. Medium bodied and light carbonation. Drinkable but not something to seek out.
Put-In-Bay Fat Man's Friend;Put In Bay, Ohio, United States;Stout;Put-In-Bay Brewing Company;An ugly stout. Brown with little head. Roasted malts, sweet caramel, little chocolate, and nutty in both the aroma and flavor. Not all that great, but I did take down the entire pint so it must not be that bad, either.

Put-In-Bay Fat Man's Friend;Put In Bay, Ohio, United States;Stout;Put-In-Bay Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub on 6/26/2006. Pours very dark brown with a creamy tan head that stays pretty well and laces some. Aromas of roasted malts, some nuts, and oddly enough some floral hops. Flavor is of chocolate, roasted malts, light coffee, and some light hops at the finish. Medium bodied with some pretty lively carbonation for a stout. Pretty smooth throughout and delivers a pretty clean finish just as the description states. This was the best of the 3 that the brewpub offered but it was still pretty average.
Domus Frambosia;Leuven, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Domus Pub and Brewery;Very dark appearance, pink head which i suspect might glow in the dark. Very sour raspberry flavour which lasts and lasts. Now that could be a good thing, however i really dislike raspberry flavoured beer, so i�m out of luck i guess. Very thick mouthfeel. Not my cup of.. erm glass of beer.
Domus Frambosia;Leuven, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Domus Pub and Brewery;Tap, Domus, June 2006. Very dark purple color, purple lacing. Aroma of raspberry, quite sweet. Strong sweet and sour taste, very very fruity of raspberry, very thick body also. Slightly sticky mouthfeel. Don�t know what to think of it, good brew, very fruity, but a bit too much of raspberry for me.
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;"bottled. wish i�d made a note of whether jacob or rene is to thank for this one. aroma of lychee, watermelon and doughnuts; plenty of bitterness and rumcake; finishes quite dry"
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;Poured amber with a small head. Hice hoppiness with floral notes. Good flavor and a solid IPA.
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;Based on tasting notes from 2006. Redbrown with a low head. Hoppy aroma on a malty base. The flavour is full of hops: citrus, orange, elderflower, and some caramel.
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;(on bottle)Hazy brown, white head. Hit of fresh hops to the nose, all US. Soft-right on carbonation. Slightly malty, and not at all, metallic finish. Steady and wellmade.

Sweet aroma of fruits, caramel, yeast and hops. the flavour is fresh and very hoppy with a good frutiness, pleasant sweetness, with pine, good dryness and bitterness. Exelent brew! bitter and fruity dry IPA with a full body.
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;Bottle. Pretty hoppy, but felt a little bit homebrewy, i.e a little unbalanced and rough around the edges. Some sweet lychee flavours from the hops and caramel sweetness from the malt. Finish shows some light acidity and then a decent bitterness.
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;Orange unclear golden with bubbly off white head. Aroma is citrus, yeast orange, hops & hops (again) Taste of hops, caramel & fruity..hops. Finish is nice & punchy bitter. Somehow one dimensional but very enjoyable!
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;Thanks to Beermouth for this nice trade! This nice beer is mahogany red, the head is limited and the aroma is absolutely wonderful:�Lots and lots of aroma hops and a hint of caramel. The flavour has loads of aroma hops, fruit, gentle citrus and hints of caramel. IMO this is a very nicely balanced beer, one that makes me say uhmmm, mhhh etc. every time I take a sip. Truly nice!! 1877
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;"Hazy dark amber body, yellowish creamy head; Alright nose but nothing special to it, it needs quite a bit more aroma but what there is is pleasant pine and orange backed by a little to much yeast aroma; Pleasant carbonation in a soft and a little to thin body, bitter but should be bitterer; Quite long a bit thin finish, the bitterness grows a bit and it is a little harsh, simple hop and malt aromas. Alright beer, but it needs a lot more character to really be something. Thanks Beermouth."
Bullerup 101 IPA;Denmark;IPA;Bullerup Bryggeri;Copper beer with a medium lasting white head. Hoppy aromas of roses, citrus plus some plum. Sweet caramel flavour that soon turns to bitterness, but seems far from the theoretical 101IBU.
Wernesgr�ner Lemon;Steinberg-Wernesgr�n, Saxony, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Wernesgr�ner Brauerei (Bitburger);23/06 A 0.33 l bottle courtesy of Marko, thanks for sharing! It poured clear pale golden body with medium sized head. A bit sweet, artificial lemony nose. Beer is actually felt in the flavor equally as that poor lemon juice, but this time didn�t help at all. Thin bodied, grainy and dusty crappy beer with fake lemon, well, can�t say it mixed up well. Sourish finish makes it even worse. Really bad.
Wernesgr�ner Lemon;Steinberg-Wernesgr�n, Saxony, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Wernesgr�ner Brauerei (Bitburger);Bottle, from Hungary. Paale golden body, small white head. Mild sweet nose, touch of lime, meh. Damn this is bad, honeyish malty background and some dustiness make this one of those few radlers with evident beer taste. Light notes of lime, acetic. Not balanced, not interesting, not too good.

Wernesgr�ner Lemon;Steinberg-Wernesgr�n, Saxony, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Wernesgr�ner Brauerei (Bitburger);A typical representative of the unfortunate mix drinks group. Sure you can taste here through the entire chemistry laboratory but not in the competition is different. Unfortunately, the beer is tasty enough to bear. Below average.
Wernesgr�ner Lemon;Steinberg-Wernesgr�n, Saxony, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Wernesgr�ner Brauerei (Bitburger);Bottle. Pale gold with a thin head. Aroma reminds me of a fruit drink when I was a kid. Lemon flavour, refreshing. Finish of lemon and a little sugary acid
Wernesgr�ner Lemon;Steinberg-Wernesgr�n, Saxony, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Wernesgr�ner Brauerei (Bitburger);Bottled. A light golden beer with a white head. The aroma has notes of lemon and straw. The flavor is sweet with notes of lemon and cardboard and a very artificial feel. The body is light.
Vermont Pub Rauchbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a rugged looking semi-dark brown almost dark orange/red sort of color. Thin cap of a little white head. No lace. The aroma has some smoke underscored by some bitter grassy hops. The flavor is basically the same with a light smoked malty aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a sly sessionably smooth feel about it. Carbonation runs fairly under but good. Overall, definitely a smoked beer and not a rauchbier despite what the name suggests. Decent for what it is, perhaps again? Not sure.
Vermont Pub Rauchbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Vermont Pub & Brewery;On-tap in Burlington. (Half pint) - Nice option. I wish more places had half-pints. Light amber color. Thin head fades fast though. Light smoky aroma, but the flavor is more hoppy than smoky. Finishes dry like a pale ale.
Vermont Pub Rauchbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Draught pint (or 2) at the brewpub. A faintly hazy/mostly clear light amber body with a decent dollop of lasting off-white head....faint smoking grasses and herbs, charred woods and a bit of toasty caramel malt in the intriguing but somewhat underpowered nose....the body is a step up, lovely bitter-sweet burnt sugars, smoky-funky cheesiness appearing in the middle, fruity tartness faint at the end and contrasting with some appropriate mineralic/burnt wood bitterness....a lovely, very drinkable and easygoing concoction reminiscent of some of Dieu du Ciel�s session smokeds.
Valley Brew Summer Soulstice Wit Beer;Stockton, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Valley Brewing Company;NorCal tasting Feb 07 - Interesting nose of marashino cherries, orange peel and coriander. A little phenolic as well. Appearance was hazy yellow, cloudy. Mouthfeel was smooth and clean. Flavors were coriander, orange peel and a little peppery. Nice beer.
Valley Brew Summer Soulstice Wit Beer;Stockton, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Valley Brewing Company;It may say Wit on the label but it immediately makes you think saison. Big white peeper and spice nose with a touch of honey. Good mouthfeel with amazing soft complexity.
Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;9/8/19 - North Little Rock, AR - on tap at Diamond Bear. Sparkling, light golden, tight, snow white head. Aroma has a hint of sour in it. Hint of honey sweetness some odd sour notes. Crisp mouthfeel.
Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Pale yellow color with a thin white head that evaporates quickly to an outer ring. Spotty lace. Wheaty aroma with fruit and malt notes. Light body with flavors of grassy wheat, fruit and grainy malt. The finish is wheaty and malty. Average overall.
Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;Neat! I�m the first one in four years to review this. The description mentions Petit Jean honey, which is neat. I haul the ol camper to Petit Jean at least once a year. Nice to see Arkansas breweries sourcing Arkansas ingredients. Pours a somewhat cloudy light golden color. It seems darker up at the top. Two fingers thin white head. Okay retention, decent lacing. Aroma...are you ready for this...three words....honey butter biscuit. I smelled it upon opening the bottle, even more after the pour. A huge honey aroma, and light butter. Yeasty...if any hops, it�s floral. Or honey hops... As good as the aroma was, the flavor isn�t quite as good. I still taste the honey butter biscuit, but the texture of the beer sort of throws it off. Yes, it�s honey, and it�s sweet. It�s pretty well carbonated, but I don�t think the carbonation helps the beer. There is some bitterness, but it comes in late. Mouthfeel is medium light. The honey does give it maybe a little stickiness to it. They used a lot of honey in this. Easy drinking, pretty smooth. Overall, this is really good. I can see myself taking a couple of these down to Cedar Falls. If you like honey, and I do, you should give this one a try. Absolutely I would recommend this, and I�ll probably go tomorrow to buy more.
Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of the one and only Butters! Pours a clear golden color with a thin creamy white head that fades pretty quickly. Aroma of big honey notes and toasted grain. The taste is honey and grainy malts. Faint hops in the finish. Medium bodied. Decent.
Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;120z bottle scored in Memphis. Lager yeast in a Weiss? Damn, this is another stone cold loser from Diamond Bear. Grainy devolved taste, gross buttery cardboard. Chock full of off flavors, this is quite disgusting. Complete nonsense beer.
Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;(12oz thanks to Lumpy best by 2010) pale yellow with soapy white head. Nose of paper, stale crackers, brown sugar, and light caramel. Taste of cracker, sugar, a bit hoppy, earthy, with decent carbonation and a linger of old.
Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;Review from notes, sampled 7/12/2008 Received 6 of these recently as part of the beer of the month club my wife purchased for me. Thanks for the opportunity dear. Deep straw color with a good sized rocky white head that laces some of my glass as it disappears. Smells a little sweet a little grassy and grainy with a bit of wheat. Taste is a little sweet, a little grainy, a little grassy, a little boring. Nothing really objectionable here, but nothing really great either. Medium to light body with ample carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Meh! Glad I got to try it, but probably wouldn�t want any more.
Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy bu11zeye. Pours a clear golden yellow with a small bubbly white head.

Diamond Bear Honey Weiss;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;12oz bottle. You know there�s gonna be trouble when the commercial description suggests adding a lemon. Bright golden color - off putting wheat and honey aroma. Taste doesn�t get much better, something is off here.
Kello Panimo Zetor III;Kellokoski, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Kello Panimo Oy;Keg (Zetor, Helsinki) Orange red, small head. Lots of interesting aromas - ranging from something a bit rotten to mashy malt, to sweet red roastiness.

Kello Panimo Zetor III;Kellokoski, Finland;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Kello Panimo Oy;Draught@Zetor, Helsinki. Dark brown colour, with a small brownish head. Very berryish and malty aroma with some weird sweetness kicking in. Flavour is malts and berries at first, but finish is very strong grassy hops. Some weak roastiness also notes.

Apis Tr�jniak Grzaniec (Grzany) Polski;Lublin, Poland;Mead;Sp�ldzielnia Pszczelarska Apis;Bottle, 13%. The aroma is vinous and citric at first, but quickly becomes sweet with a distinct honey note. There is also a whiff of beeswax. The colour is dark golden. It has a good, sweet honey flavour. The mouthfeel is thin, obviously, compared to the stronger types of good Polish mead, but the mead is flavourful and good.

La Jolla Brewhouse ESB;La Jolla, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;La Jolla Brewhouse;Tasted at La Jolla. Clear golden amber with thin creamy white head. Caramel and hops aroma. Roasty caramel taste with a crisp hoppy biterness to the finish.
La Jolla Brewhouse ESB;La Jolla, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;La Jolla Brewhouse;(Draft: La Jolla Brewhouse in La Jolla, CA) Cripes, what is it today with these beers at La Jolla Brewhouse? Another one that pours with absolutely no head. Bright amber and nearly clear, but with no heading whatsoever, this isn�t an attractive beer. The nose is grainy with some light English hops and isn�t inspiring. The malt is fairly roasty for an ESB, a bit too heavy-handed for the style if you ask me. Moderate bitterness really takes hold of this beer after a few sips. Medium bodied with more than ample carbonation, making this beer too burpy. Flavorful, but just not doin� it for me.
La Jolla Brewhouse Porter;La Jolla, California, United States;Porter;La Jolla Brewhouse;Tap at the Brewhouse. Pours cola brown with a creamy beige head that left some nice lacing. A good amount of roasted malts, cocoa dust and some nutty notes in both aroma and flavor. A tasty porter.
La Jolla Brewhouse Porter;La Jolla, California, United States;Porter;La Jolla Brewhouse;On tap @ the La Jolla Brewhouse brewpub. Pours a nice deep garnet with lasting light tan head and spotty lacing. It has a mild aroma of roasted malts and not much else really. It could use a bigger aroma. The taste is rich roasty malts that lean toward burnt malts that seem to grow stronger into the finish and fulfilling my interpretation of the style. I also get just a faint hoppiness in there too.
La Jolla Brewhouse Porter;La Jolla, California, United States;Porter;La Jolla Brewhouse;On tap at brewery. Copper brown with almost no head. Sweet roasty slightly caramel taste. Watery palate with a disappointing finish.
La Jolla Brewhouse Porter;La Jolla, California, United States;Porter;La Jolla Brewhouse;(Draft: La Jolla Brewhouse in La Jolla, CA) Most of the beers at La Jolla Brewhouse are okay, but not good enough to ever want to order again. However, this ulfiltered porter is quite nice. I�m not sure if they make a filtered porter, but they are making a point to say this is unfiltered. It�s dry, fairly roasty and moderately bitter, and the flavor of hops is easily distinguishable. Some chalkiness in the flavor as well. In the nose, it�s mostly just hops and roast, so it�s mirroring the flavor. Medium bodied, but very carbonated and burpy. The color is very dark brown at the edge and black through the center. Quarter inch of tan head settles to a wide ring and leaves lots of cobwebs and dusty lacing over much of the glass. Easily one of the best beers I�ve had on tap at this brewpub.
Batemans Alexanders;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;Pint on tap in Alexanders bar, Chester. Amber appearance with a good head. Lovely fruity sweet aroma. Tastes like a tropical fruit with a low bitterness, very smooth to drink leaving no harse citrus aftertaste. I enjoyed this beer alot, however was a little flat.
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;On draught at Barleys, Knoxville on 8 July 2006 (as Locker Stock Alt). Darkish copper colour. Biscuity malt prominent throughout. Seemed to have a little residual sweetness at first but finished quite dry. Had no idea this was 8.0% as it wasn�t at all boozy and drunk very easily. A decent example, even if way stronger than a typical German version.
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;Poured a deep amber color with a soft pillowy white head that left excellent lacing. The lacing came down in rings almost as if cask conditioned, which is weird because others have described little to no head. Smell was a bit floral and fruity, light citrus, and a hint of biscuit. Taste was very good. Had a nice malt backbone to it, caramel like flavors balanced nicely with the hops, still leaning towards the hoppy side though. Mouthfeel was a bit lighter than medium bodied, and somewhat low carbonation, but seemed to fit pretty well. Very drinkable beer, I plan on stopping by for a few more pints before it runs out.
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;Tap @ Charlie Mopps: Poured a clear very dark chestnut color with a small off-white head. The aroma was moderately hoppy with earthy and sweaty notes. While it was hop forward and not huge on the hops, it did completely cover the malt. The flavor was a mix of malt and citrus and earthy hop. Dry and moderately bitter. Light on the carbonation. Tasty.
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;On tap @ Coles Buffalo NY. Good version of the style. Malty toasty & enjoyable
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;"On tap @ Brew Kettle 8/3/06: Cloudy mogogany brown body w/a lasting off white head. Herbal & earthy hop aromas up front w/ a bit of citrus; For some reason the overall aroma when chilled reminds me of a wet dog until it warms? Odd...Anyway, very light toasty malt aroma gets stronger as it warms and also has a light sulphury yeast and clean of fruitiness for the most part. First flavor is an herbal/iced tea hop flavor, but becomes citrusy toward the end. Toasty malt flavor & well balanced for the most part, but finishes lightly bitter and dry. A bit of resiny hop flavor lingers into the lasting aftertaste of herbal and citrus hops. Clean flavor overall of any fruitiness. Higher carbonation, dry m/f, light but not watery body, well hidden alc.. I�m not a huge fan of alt biers, and this one has some decent flavors, but it�s not a favorite of mine. Not a bad beer, just not to my liking."
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;On tap at Mad Mex North, Pittsburgh as Rogue Anniversary Altbier. Light worty grain sourness, with a bit of cider. Fruity hops but weak, and with a bit of honey thrown in. Dark amber clear with a bit of haze, topped with slight off-white lacing head. Medium-heavy watery body with medium carbonation. Starts with good bitterness and medium malt profile. Not really any sweetness to it. Some caramel, mainly a chalky finushing bitterness that is quite heavy for the style. Mild acohol warming. Overall, kinda watery.
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;On tap. Ruby brown with tan colored head. Aroma is citrus, floral, and hops. Very similar to an IPA. Flavor is close to the aroma and very bitter.
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;[Had this on tap as Rogue Anniversary Alt at The Brickskeller prior to the RBSG 2006 - and since others visiting the Brickskeller around that time have placed their ratings here - I do the same] A hazy nut brown beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma is sweet and somewhat nutty. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of caramel and nuts - and it is quite carbonated.
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;Bottle drank at Max�s in Baltimore Caramel brown color, creamy off-white head, nose of light sweet malt, some hop and a bit of fruitiness. The flavor is lightly bitter, nice body and the typical blasse pacman yeast taste. The finish is a bit creamy, but resoundingly uninteresting.
Rogue AltBier;Newport, Oregon, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rogue Ales;Draught - It�s the right color with a huge tan head. Smells less roasted and more hoppy than traditional style but that is to be expected. Pretty hoped for an alt with a bit of roastedness coming through at the end. Not an alt except by color description and maybe grain bill. But still a decent beer that would also be a good session beer.
Bjeizelereke Blond;Meer (Hoogstraten), Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Scheldebrouwerij;Bottled (seems to be this, brewed at Scheldebrouwerij). Golden colour small white head.

Bjeizelereke Blond;Meer (Hoogstraten), Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Scheldebrouwerij;Bottle @ home shared with Thompson. Clear golden color, small to average sized white to off-white head. Aroma is lightly malts and a bit sweetish. Taste malts, sweetish, malty sweet, slightly grainy. Average body, medium carbonation. Pretty boring imo, but it�s drinkable.

Bjeizelereke Blond;Meer (Hoogstraten), Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Scheldebrouwerij;Blond session beer with a thick, sticky, cream white head and golden blonde colour with nice sparkling and loosely floating yeast particles. Strongly banana- or banana liqueur-like aroma, apple, vanilla, peach, honey, some grassy and floral hops. Fruity taste (banana, apple) with subdued bitterness and honeyish malt, sweet and even a bit sugary, but drying out towards the end and finishing in a long, aromatic hoppiness, with noticeable alcohol.

Too much carbo , but on the doable side . Taste is sweet , but doable . tiny amount of bitterness . Ok beer , but rather boring by being one amongst a few hundred of the ( almost ) same taste ...
Bjeizelereke Blond;Meer (Hoogstraten), Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Scheldebrouwerij;Starts with a nice white head but disappears quickly. Dark yellow unfiltered (?) colour. Smell of dry malts and spices. Sweet cirus and apricot taste, a bit dry aftertaste of smokey malts and bread.

Walrave Toverhekske;Laarne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Walrave;Laarne is a village with a witches� folklore and apparently, after decades of silently, almost secretly brewing solely their old school Pick Up �pils�, the local family brewery of Walrave decided it was about time to join in on the local folklore. This was the result, in 2006: a stereotypical �sp�ciale belge� style ale, with stable, regular, yellowish white head and copper, almost bronzish colour, clear. The aroma reveals pure nutty maltiness, subdued caramel, a lot of iron, some phenols, dried leaves, flowers, dried fruit, some peppery hops. Soft dry fruity taste, fresh, strong nutty and caramelly maltiness, clean with thinnish mouthfeel and a relatively long grassy and leafy hop bitterishness in the finish, which also appears a bit phenolic, even medicinal. Interesting, it seems as if the recent �wave� of beer attention in Belgium has awakened this sleeping brewery, prompting it to this shy attempt at joining the beer revolution. Needs more work, agreed, but the fact alone that Walrave created a new beer was enough to get me on a trip to Laarne to find it.
Walrave Toverhekske;Laarne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Walrave;Bottle. Pours red amber, lowish head. Light resiny fruit aroma. Dry body, light metallic on the palate. Light berrylike notes, demera sugar, fairly lightfooted. Quick finish.

""Chinese"" type, very expressly so, as well as some dark ""perfumed"" malts, and greenery. But the ""curry"" (probably including som meaty esters) is spot-on. Sweet, nutty taste, dark and sweet bread. In the finish again spicey, but I�d hesitate to call it curry any longer. It�s strangely sweet, near jam-like, weird for Marc Limet�s doings. Quite well-bodied, some restrained, but present alcoholburn. Sweet, long aftertaste. I happen to know quite some Kerkom beers I like a LOT more.

Founders Summer Wit;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. Tasted like an amped-up version of their Gold Sunshine. Hazy yellow-straw body, thin white head. Nose and body dominated by spicy, perfumey hops (Amarillo?), with a grassy backbone. Hints of spice and coriander. Thin-bodied. Not exactly a traditional wit, which would be preferable.

Draught House Guy Smiley Mild;Austin, Texas, United States;Mild Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Served a near black with a small amount of brown when held to the sun, extremely thin tan ring for a head. Aroma of coffee, toffee, a various malt blend (am I right Josh?), and great memories. That�ll suffice. Hits the mouth with a firm medium body, malt was roasted throughtly middle holds up well, finish is delightful with some lingering bitterness, sweetness, and a tiny amount of acidity- much like my wife- da da dump DING. Ever since douglas88 turned me onto Utah beers (below 4%) , I�ve been a big fan of small beer with a whole lotta flavor. This is no different.
Draught House Guy Smiley Mild;Austin, Texas, United States;Mild Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;(Draught) Pours a dark brown body with a medium tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, earth, coffee, chocolate, and grass. Flavor of earth, celery, baking cocoa, light citrus, and roasted malt.
Draught House Guy Smiley Mild;Austin, Texas, United States;Mild Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;The beer pours a hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is strong chocolate with some dark malts. The flavor is a mix of oats, coffee and chocolate. The oats are really obvious and very nice. The mouthfeel is a little watery and the carbonation is low. The beer doesn�t have all of the flavor of a good porter, but as a less than 4 percent ABV beer, this one has a ton of flavor and is outstanding.
Draught House Guy Smiley Mild;Austin, Texas, United States;Mild Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Tastes like really rotten bananas dipped in chocolate. Super strong alcohol flavor. Metal. Lots of metal. All that being said, I guess it�s good for its style. What do I know. This is my 3rd rate.

Draught House Guy Smiley Mild;Austin, Texas, United States;Mild Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Pours a rich deep brown with a light beige head. Smell is lightly roasty, nuts, and fruits. Pretty nice. Taste is light coffee, roasty malt some fruitiness and a gummy quality to it as well. Slightly full mouthfeel and lightly prickly carbonation. Very solid beer and an enjoyable one too.
Draught House Guy Smiley Mild;Austin, Texas, United States;Mild Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;A dark brown beer with a 1 inch tan frothy head that settles quickly to a thin film. Aroma of rich and slightly creamy dark malt. Flavor is pale bitter and dominated by dark roasted malt. Texture is slghtly creamy and finish is a little harsh. Mouthfeel is very fizzy and carbonated. Lacing is heavy and intricate. I give this beer a good rating because of the incredible amount of flavor for such a low %.
Draught House Guy Smiley Mild;Austin, Texas, United States;Mild Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Very fruity aroma. Served from the tap was a nice dark brown with a small tan head. Rich malt and nutty flavors along with some of the fruitiness from the nose. A very nice brown ale
Draught House Guy Smiley Mild;Austin, Texas, United States;Mild Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Milds could save my life. I could stop drinking things like barleywines. Sure. Like that�s really gunna happen. This was a mild, okay? and as such will have me hard pressed to rave, but it had some nice malt in there and was easy on the hops and came across as a VERY easily quaffable brew that could keep me happy for a bit until I started my usual bitching and wanted it to be prostituted for something with more and more and more until a mild it was no longer.

Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;A quality beer even if it�s been awhile since it�s been bottled. The aroma is quite sweet, grassy with a bready touch. Flavor is noble hops, with a soft citrus angle...extremely quick and clean finish. Looks a bit odd in the glass, almost like a watere-down lemonade...and odd pale yellow color and a big fluffy white head. Nice beer.
Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;Not bad, but not the best thing that I have ever tried from Deschutes. A very bready malt background, with some light lemony citrus zest notes, some earthy herbal hoppiness. A typical take on a pils.
Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;Bomber, courtesy after4ever. I have no idea how long this rating has been sitting around, before I entered it tonight. It has to be well over a year. But as A.A. Milne observed, �One of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly making exciting discoveries.� Pours clear gold with a fluffy white head. Aroma and taste of noble hops, fruit and biscuit. Yup, this is a Pils.
Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;Light colored straw-golden body with a decent white head. Bready, malty, hopped nose. Flavor was citrusy and earthy. Not like a standard pils at all. Tangy lemony finish. Not bad at all.
Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;For this style of brew I cannot imagine it coming closer to perfect for my taste. Ugly and pale in the glass with a nice, pure white h ead. Very sweet and dry with a grassy, hay, tart flavour that really works well. vey lemony with a slight malty, oat twist. The malt missing in most pilsners plays a strong role in this one and really makes it a fine drink.
Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;Off notes from 11/06. Pours a crystal clear straw color with some head. Nose is slightly hoppy, but tame. Flavor is excellent. Multiple characteristics coming together for a smooth ride. Starts slightly bitter with a tart lemon/citrus edge. Touch of a sweet edge. Very smooth. Mouthfeel has a good carbonation. Unsurpassed drinkability. Happy 18th Anniversary Deschutes!
Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;Pours a clear golden color with a ring of white lace. Decent but not great aroma of malt and honey. The flavor has honet, malt and hops with a mild bitter finish. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and soft carbonation. Decent but it lacks the crisp feeling I like in German Pilsners.
Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;"07-Jun-07 (22 oz bottle: Purchased 14-Mar-07 for $3.65 at Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) There�s nothing quite like the sight of a well-carbonated pilsener in an authentic pilsener glass. Tiny carbonation bubbles rise slowly through the crystal clear, golden body, gradually picking up steam as they get closer to their brethren waiting for them in the small, white head. A hops-dominated nose features notes of hay and grass, but the malt aromas are light and generic. The grassy, hay-like hops continues the theme on the palate, contributing a mild bitterness from start to finish. Grainy malts are pretty standard for an American pilsener, so this beer�s main downfall -- it simply fails to match the malty richness of its German counterparts. Light-medium bodied and well-carbonated on the palate with a bit of dusty dryness in the finish and a casual, refreshing crispness that makes this beer easy to drink. Overall, this is a decent pilsener that�s certainly drinkable, but the beer misses the mark because it just can�t mimic the rich, ""brew day"" maltiness of the classic German examples."
Deschutes 18th Anniversary Pilsner;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Deschutes Brewery;Strong honey with underlying malty sweetness and herbal, grassy hops apparent. Brilliantly clear blonde body is topped by a low but lasting partial cover of large bubbled white head that leaves some spotty lace. Moderate bitterness over sweet and lightly musty honey flavour. Straw and herbal hops offer counterpoint but are perhaps faded. Sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Thin, light body is somewhat lifeless in the mouth despite aggressive carbonation. Bottle sampled in Fall, 2006 with beerbuzzmontreal, Cathschlag, GlouGlouBurp, MartinT, Olivier_MTL, Rastacouere and Yowie.

ZEOS Black;Argos, Argolida, Greece;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;ZEOS Brewing Company;"Dark amber brew with a thick, toasty brownish caramel head. Interesting wheaty nose, full of grain character and caramel malt, and sweetened by notes of raisin and brown sugar. The body is a sweet mix of raisin cereal grain and caramel malt. Very interesting and enjoyable. Earlier Rating: 5/30/2013 Total Score: 3.2 Root beer colored with a thin head. Labelled as ""stout"" on the Greek restaurant beer menu, this came off as more of a porter in roast character. Now, seeing that this is a schwarzbier, it makes sense. Black patent nose with mild roastiness and mild hop flavor. Decent stuff."
ZEOS Black;Argos, Argolida, Greece;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;ZEOS Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours clear brown with reddish tint against the light, large spongy beige head, roasted malt-rye aroma, medium carbonation, mildly bitter roasted malt taste with slightly sour end, smooth body, medium finish. Not bad, there is an interesting sourish element that could be from rye or other grain.
ZEOS Black;Argos, Argolida, Greece;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;ZEOS Brewing Company;Pours brown with a medium, off white head. The aroma was practically nonexistent. I tried very hard and I found a bit of caramel, which was an altogether underwhelming result. The taste is dry and heavily earthy. Nuts, bread, caramel, and some licorice are also found, though these supporting impressions are all more subtle. An earthy finish is rather short. Its light in body and has a thin texture. Nothing distinguishes this forgettable effort.

St. - Barbara;Ertvelde, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Orange-gold; good white head, quite stable. No nose discernible. Agreed, the circumstances were far from ideal. My drinking companion claims this is Augustijn. Well. Augustijn has not a ""hint of malts"" but plenty of malts. I think of Augustijn as sweetish-alcoholic, this is SWEET. True, the freezing serving temperature hides a lot of flavours, but also sweetness... Pretty light MF for a 7+ abv beer. Little bit of metallic bitterness in the aftertaste. The idea being?"
Boelens Tongsneyder;Belsele, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Boelens;"Bottle from somewhere in Gooik - thanks to Frank! Beer 'commemorating' the Tongsneyders, an 18th century robbers' gang that had their hideout on the Kesterheide in Gooik. Apparently they cut off the tongues of their victims to maintain secrecy. Anywho, this one pours hazy ochre with a big, lasting, foamy, off-white head; lots of lacing; some floaties. Sweet & floral aroma of banana, pineapple, hay, honey, white bread, white sugar, flowers, hand soap even, juniper berries, garden herbs, some caramel. It tastes medium fruity sweet, some pineapple & banana, and light spicy bitter; hints of bread & yeast. Dryish, grassy & floral hoppy finish, lingering banana & honey sweetness, with warming jenever alcohol. Medium to full body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. Typical Boelens brew, quite the overload of herbs & flowers, but likeable, so please don't cut off my tongue while I'm drinking this."

Boelens Pikkeling;Belsele, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Boelens;On my bottle the brewery is Boelens and the strengt is 8% alcohol. But there is also the Paelman version. My beer was good until 2006. When i opened the bottle, the beer was coming out of it. Because of the yeast on the bottom i took a closer look to the botle and found out that it is an older version of this beer. Some bitterness and a lot of fruits are still there in the taste. The fruit you can also smell
Boelens Pikkeling;Belsele, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Boelens;"I have no idea what the relation of this beer is to the ""Pikkeling Tripel"" ""made"" by brewery Paeleman. Hazy orange with faint olive shine; very white, medium head. Diacetyl. Diacetyl. Dia - oh and coriander, to add insult to injury. Coriander and diacetyl in the taste. Then, there is more coriander. God knows what it is supposed to mask. Medium bodied, very slick MF. To paraphrase a big Belgian brewer in Britain: reassuringly horrible."

Poured out all the crud into one of the glasses. Got more of a head, but less of an aroma. 7 Lovely grainy body. Some sweet bitter almond retronasals. Very simple, but basically just what you want and expect from a heller bock. It�s all about the malts in this one. A bit of a sweaty 100kg wrestler but you know he�s gentle at heart, even though you�re in a headunder his sweaty armpit (on the presumption that you detect androsterone as sweet). In fact the cloudier pour is the more sophisticated face of this beer, so you�re in less of a headlock. Nicely - a mix of the two glasses finds a perfect balance. 4 Almost textbook heller bock. Smooth and full, gentle carbonation is pleasant. And my - what a finish, so very dry and bitter yet herby and sweet. This is odd - I even get mint in the finish. 14 Doesn�t completely hide the 6.5%, but there�s no booze in it at all. Just a bock how a bock should be.

Biggest head of any beer I had at this brewery. Aroma was light, wheaty, a little malt. Taste was crisp, clean, refreshing and light. Some hoppy notes, although it�s hard to taste them. I think this was my 2nd favorite beer here, and that�s sad since lights aren�t my thing at all. Pretty well done though.

Slopes Northern Maine Brewing Blueberry Wheat;Presque Isle, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Slopes Northern Maine Brewing Company;Tap. Yecch. I remember my last full day in Presque Isle. I stopped by for one more chance to try one of the beers I hadn�t already tasted at Slopes. Of course it would be their Fruit Beer. When I asked the girl who waited on us why not one of slopes beers have any flavor, and why this one just tasted like Blueberry sryrup, she showed me the pump bottle with the blueberry syrup in it that was kept behind the bar to put the final touches on this puke of a beer. Well done docter.
Slopes Northern Maine Brewing Blueberry Wheat;Presque Isle, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Slopes Northern Maine Brewing Company;Touch of sweetness? None of Slopes beers need a touch of sweetness, what they need is a little more alcohol to balance out all those sugars. Regardless, this was a crisp light maine blueberry like they all make. It�s similar to Blue paw, but slightly better in it�s mouthfeel as it�s a bit more crisp and smooth.

Bar Harbor True Blue Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;Bottle. Aroma: blueberry, hops, malt, vanilla. Taste is blueberry and sweet. Refreshing and drinkable. Better than most fruit beer, but it is still a fruit beer, so nothing about here.
Bar Harbor True Blue Blueberry Ale;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bar Harbor Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance had a clean copper colored body with a half finger white head, there was some sporadic lacing leaving no rings. The lacing gently slid down the sides of the glass. The smell was centered around the blueberries with just a bit of malt in the background. The taste was the same, blueberries followed by the malts. On the palate, it sat about a light to medium, sessionable, crisp and clean - very balanced. Overall, this is an excellent choice for a blueberry ale if one decides to go for one. I would definitely have this again.

A touch of pine tasting hops comes in at the very end. M - Medium to light body and quite smooth. D - Very good drinkability. Smooth and very refreshing with the citrus and floral taste.

Roosters Brewing Devils Grip Blackberry;Locations in Ogden and Layton, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Roosters Brewing Co. (US);Great Utah Beer Run � Summer 2007 On Tap � A special summer only beer this had a golden color with a light fruity aroma. The flavor was weak in fruit which was what I was hoping to taste. Needed more fruit flavor to be a great fruit beer. Had a sweet finish but that did not do the trick.
Roosters Brewing Devils Grip Blackberry;Locations in Ogden and Layton, Utah, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Roosters Brewing Co. (US);An interesting if overused fruity beer. An abundance of blackberry flavoring, leaves this beer almost cloying not from the sweetness but from overwhelming artifical fruit flavors. Light malty chracter in the background is not enough to save this one from being severely unbalanced. Usually it is the other way around.

Batemans Hop Bine Bitter (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;I don�t normally �do� organic, but because this is a Bateman�s beer I felt duty bound to try it. Brown 500ml bottle, best before mid Apr 2008, drank late March 2007. Poured into a Frankenheim Alt 0.2 litre straight glass two and a half times. It was a light copper, amber colour with a small white head on each pour. Smells of an English country garden, sweet pea being the overiding aroma, very floral indeed. Is this anything to do with the fact that it is made with organically grown hops and barley? I don�t know, but it smells sweeter than anything else Bateman�s produce (in my opinion). The label says it smells of freshly harvested grain, but it doesn�t to me. Toffee apples can be added to the sweet peas as the beer warms in the glass. The taste isn�t as exciting as the aroma, bitterness with a hint of pink grapefruits, but there is nothing to much in the taste at all. Mouthfeel is almost watery, a slight bitterness and citrus flavour clings to the back of your throat, but again there isn�t much of anything. I love Bateman�s beers normally, this one however is not up to their normal standards �in my eyes�.
Batemans Hop Bine Bitter (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;4.2% organic beer, amber colour with a thin head, don�t know what the aroma was if anything it was soapy, not as hoppy as the label would suggest, it was only an ok bitter.

Batemans Hop Bine Bitter (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;Bottle, Aldi, Birkenhead. Nice of the missus to think of me whilst cruising the aisles. This was lingering like a bit of a bad smell at the back of my stash cupboard for quite some time though. When the moment finally came to pop this open I was as suitably underwhelmed as I imagined I would be. Unimaginative and standard malty fayre. Drinkable, just. The thought that counts eh..

Batemans Hop Bine Bitter (Bottle);Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;Bottle bought at Aldi. Inviting copper colour with moderate carbonation and a decent, off-white head. Unfortunately. it went downhill from there...... Aroma of boiled sweets, oranges and tired hops.

The aroma offers up dark roasted malts, malt sweetness and some earthiness too. The taste is initially a mix of dark roasted malts and earthiness as well as some caramel malts creating a pleasing near robust flavor experience. It then heads into a dry finish created by the moderate level of roasted malts astringency. Tasty brown for sure.

Charlie and Jakes Nitro Pale Ale;Melbourne, Florida, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Charlie & Jakes Brewery & BBQ;Draft-Best Charlie and Jakes brew-by far. The beer comes to you with a medium size, frothy head that leaves lacing all the way to the end of the drink. You are hit with a nice portion of fresh hoppy aroma while you enjoy looking at the cloudy yellow-gold color of the brew. The taste includes enough hops to keep me happy, maybe not enough for hopheads, but plenty for my palate. One minor complaint, they could have served it in a bigger glass.

Cwmbran Nut Brown Premium Ale;Cwmbran, Wales;Brown Ale;Cwmbran;"Tasted by half-pint at the Pembury Tavern, Hackney, N. London, on 02/07/2006. It was just on when I ordered it, so it came just absolutely fresh~~ Appearance: dark russet-brown colour with great clarity, coming with a thin foamy head full of pancake-like large air-cells weaved together; very low carbonation. Smell: a slightly sour edge of pineapple-ish fruitiness comes with a delicious nutty-sweet flow of malts, accompanied by a little sulphur at the back; very low in hoppyness but fairly balanced and smooth overall, a bit like a cup of black-tea with nut syrup. Taste: a mouthful of malts, very much like caramel-coated nuts with a faintly roasty tinge of dark malts; slightly tangy at the back of the palate, but the hop entry is extremely low; a bit of sourness of raw nuts develops in the end. Short finish with a very restrained aftertaste. Overall: Fresh in texture but thin-ish in terms of the overall body. This brown ale gears towards the boring side, as without the contribution from hops, the maltiness is not sufficiently complex and couldn�t keep one�s interest for long."

Luther-Bier Original Dunkel;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Bottle, shared by yespr. It looks quite nice in the glass, with it�s clear brown body and a beige head. The aroma and flavor on the other hand isn�t much impressive. There�s burnt plastic notes, some roasted malt and coffee and a little note of cooked vegetables in the aroma. The flavor is slightly better, still some cooked vegetables and plastic, but overpowered by roasted malt, and with some coffee. Roasted finish. Medium body. Far from impressing, but luckily it tastes better than it smells. (080822)

Luther-Bier Original Dunkel;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Meininger Privatbrauerei;The bottle looks good, but not incredible. The beer in the glass is okay, too. Not much foam. The beer starts vapid. Turns then a bit spicy-malty. The finish is chemical - like soap. Very ugly! Not really a good beer!
Luther-Bier Original Dunkel;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Meininger Privatbrauerei;"Tap into Lager glass. Enjoyed at what is claimed to have been one of Martin Luther�s favorite haunts, the Kartoffelhaus ""Zum Schwarzen Baer"" in Wittenberg, Germany. Appearance was a beer bottle brown with a nice tan head that laced with some sportiness. Aroma was spicy and malty, plus touch of sweet. Drank alright, although not as distinguished as it�s namesake: a sweet malt, some grassiness, some hoppy character. Bitter on the end and somewhat thick around the mouth for a while after finishing. Not a bad brew, but really was overshadowed by the fact that I was sitting where The Great Reformer himself supposedly sat. I was, frankly, already drunk on the historical setting even before I took a sip."

Floral notes with a cut grass aroma, the taste sweeter than the nose hinted at, yet with a mild citrus flavour cutting into the floral traces from the aroma. Slight bitterness towards the finish.

BJ's Mollys Irish Stout;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Stout - Dry;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Backlog rating Tucson trip 2006: Dark red brown. Light metallic roast. Fruity base. Medium body. creamy mouthfeel. Fruity notes in the finish. Nice.
BJ's Mollys Irish Stout;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Stout - Dry;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Tap @ Papago. Had a decent chocolate aroma. Black body with decent head. A medium middle of the road chocolate flavor. Did have a creamy texture to it otherwise it would be just ordinary stout.. Smooth on the palate.
BJ's Mollys Irish Stout;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Stout - Dry;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On tap. Almost black in colour with a medium sized head. Very comfortable and round. Roasted malt with notes of coffee and chocolate.
BJ's Mollys Irish Stout;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Stout - Dry;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On tap: Once again I�m getting a big metal, almost penny-like aroma. I don�t know if it�s the beer or maybe the soap they use, but either way it�s a problem. Outside the metal there is a light coffee, chocolate, and faint cream aroma as well. Dark brown with no tranparency and a nice beige head with great retention and lacing. While the aroma has been a problem in both stouts I�ve tried, the certainly aren�t lacking in appearance. Flavor is a little light. Light and watery flavors of coffee, chocolate, and a touch of cream. Slight bitterness in the finsh. Lacking overall in any significant flavors and comes across as a little boring. Drinkable, but nothing special.
Gubernija Imperial Stiprus Alus;�iauliai, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gubernija;1l bottle (SOPP2009) Pale amber, brief head. Slightly sickly sweet aroma, malty, honey, almost miod-like. In the mouth there�s a big papery retronasal hit, however, it�s also a fairly full body. Some alcohol does come through. Paperiness too strong, alas. Quite schizophrenic - swimming pool water and paper versus rich sweet malts. Tough call.
Gubernija Imperial Stiprus Alus;�iauliai, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gubernija;Yellow colored, fastly vanishing white head. Sweet, slightly spicy, alcoholic and tangy fruity aroma with mild butterness. Medium bodied. Flavor is malty and mildly alcoholic with sweet and hopped tones. Aftertaste is mildly dry with butter and alcohol. Some plastic tones came from bottle.
Trys Lokiai;Ma�eikiai, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;UAB Brauer;Dark golden colored, no head. Sweetness, honey, mild hops, butter and cardboard with medium alcohol in aroma. Medium bodied.

Fruity malt aroma, red berry. Grapefruity hop. Nice enough bitter, red berry fruits and hop. Maybe lacks a little body in mouth. Still, a good beer.
Rebellion Stewed;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask conditioned at Merton Beer Festival Fri July 7th 2006. You have to hand it to Rebellion they do produce some solid, good quality beers and red and fruity is a very accurate description of this one along with a nice maltiness and some hops this really was a jolly decent beer.
Rebellion Stewed;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask conditioned at Merton Summer Beer Festival 06. Red amber beer with bubbly head.

Moonlight Toasted Wheat and Rye;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);While hopspicking at the brewery - ah the memories - in September 2006: Nice orange color, fizzy carbonation, lace like head. Huge rye nowe, also some hoppy tones - long lasting finish.
Moonlight Toasted Wheat and Rye;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Tap. A muddy brown color. RIch malty toasted bread flavor with a semi-sweet, chocolate and robust flavor. Rating from 11/05 notes.
Moonlight Toasted Wheat and Rye;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Grainy beadynose, brownish amber color, fluff head. Bready caramelly malt bas, spicy hop end. Big taste, bold. Interesting blend of malts and hops. Well done.
Moonlight Toasted Wheat and Rye;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Draft. Bronze beer with a nice off-white head. Earthy/spicey aroma that seems to be mostly from the rye. Spicy/earthy flavor - light citrus/slight wheat. Again rye adds most to the contribution. Some metallic tones. Light grassy finish. Didn�t get much toasty flavor.
Moonlight Toasted Wheat and Rye;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Thanks again to Fly. Very good lager with a nice toasty flavor that finishes clean.
Moonlight Toasted Wheat and Rye;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);This beer is a rather nice lager with a light to medium bitterness clean finish. Think that as much as I like this beer, I�m as much impressed by the brewing abilities of Brian in his creation of excellent lagers, his kindness and that of Joe in helping to get this beer to me. THANKS!
Moonlight Toasted Wheat and Rye;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Big and round with a substantial and lightly creamy body economically powered by light-medium effervescence. The hop mix yields some neroli bitterness tinged by agreeable phenolic hues. Some light even fruitless carmels, lightly toasty add to the experience in ample but subdued amounts. Alcohol seems wholly cloaked in taste and flavor by otherwise apparent. This is a surprisingly quaffable big sipper I�ll have to sit down with again. Another big winner from Brian Hunt.
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;Draft. Amberbeerw ith a cream head. Light grapefruit aroma. Light grapefruit and caramel flavor. Medium bodied. Decent-good bitterness. Light grapefruit and light pine linger with light caramel.
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;From my brother: pours copper with a thick frothy head. Aroma is pine and hefty grapefruit. Taste is fairly bitter... not sure how old this is but still packs a punch. Interesting to drink an old school IPA in this era of everyone dealing in haze.
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;A very red ipa with a lot of malt character on the nose. There is certainly plenty of bitterness with a lot of resinous pine in the finish. The hop aromatics however are pretty minimal. Not a bad beer, just a dated IPA.
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;Nice copper color and a slightly citrus nose. Flavor is citrus with much of it being grapefruit. The grapefruit takes over on the finish making it an unbalanced beer. No seconds.
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;From the can with no date that I can ascertain. Medium amber pour with yellow hues and a cream colored head. Good clarity. The aroma is subtle but I get some caramel malts and a little earth and herb or maybe feint tobacco. Medium and bubbly bottle. The taste has some modest toffee or caramel malt notes with a clean finish. More traditional and not super hopped up.
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;I had a few of these delicious IPAs on draft at the Fairways in Limerick. They even had it on the nitro tap! The body was silky smooth with an awesome mouthfeel and texture. I got a decent amount of hops with a light and bready malt flavor. This was definitely a great choice for a beer to enjoy on a night out!
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;Flight at CCB. Light amber full off white head. Musty aroma. Pine hop flavor, malt backing. To style
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;greg bonus can. hoppy but unappealing ipa. gummy taste. nothing clicks. so-so drinkability.
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;Draft at the brewery. Light brown-gold, small tan foam. Mild fruity hop, some astringent bitterness. Malt richness, nothing fresh here. Decent for E Coast style but still disappointing.
Cape Cod IPA;Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Cape Cod Beer;Growler. A dark golden beer with a beige head. The aroma has notes of hops, spices, malt, and toffee. The flavor is sweet with notes of hops, caramel, spices, and malt, leading to a bitter finish.
East End Session #04 - Single Malt Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;East End Brewing Company;Draught. At the Map Room in Regent square. Radio Star Kevin Battle,Dave E. and I enjoyed a few of these on a Saturday night out at the best brew spots in Pittsburgh. Poured in a nice dimpled mug, the bartender was an amazing trivia buff and the other bartender had a great converstation with us about relics in Pittsburgh Catholic churches (especially Troy Hill). Anyway, this beer was tangy and interesting, without a small head and a cool roasted, sweet flavor that made it an easy drinking beer. Scott has done some great things lately with different styles of beers and this one certainly adds to that great (although short) history.
East End Session #04 - Single Malt Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;East End Brewing Company;On tap at D�s. Golden pour with small white head. Palate is somewhat thin and a little sticky. Easy to drink but overall pretty boring. Aroma and flavor of grass, pine and lots of mint.

East End Session #04 - Single Malt Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;East End Brewing Company;From Growler. Poured dark copper, white fizzy head. Aroma piney and sweet. Flavor malty, with nice grassy, piney aftertaste with sweet caramel undertones. As it warmed the hop flavors were more present. Medium bodied, complex, well meshed flavors.
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;pours amber , thick head. big citrus aroma with hints of evergreen. flavor is grapefruit, lemon, orange, with a bitterness tha t lasts. hoppy anniversary. my home brewpub ==> Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Pours a clear golden color with a thin white head. Mild aroma of hops. Decent flavor of citrusy hops with a bitter finish. The body is light with an oily texture and gentle carbonation. It feels like there�s something missing in there, oh I know, malt.
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Growler from Rayboy. Solid APA with plenty of hops and even some spicy notes running through it.
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Growler from the pub: Pours a golden orange with a small head. The aroma is hops, oranges, and tangerines, the flavor follows with oranges, lemon, and malt balanced with a late bitterness that lingers in the middle of your tongue. It�s balanced and refreshing.
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;copper body with a lacing white head. the aroma was hops, i would guess columbus is one of the carieties used due to the grassy smell. this one is lopsided the hops alright. mainly grass flavors with the iron taste like the lingering taste of blood. a bit of honey, but the malt hides in this. a bit of lemon comes out in the finish. i can see this beer making some people happy, but it just did not work for me.
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;When I heard that the anniversary brew was going to be an APA, I was somewhat disappointed. But boy, did Matt & Andrew come through on this one. It�s a lighly hazed amber ale with a thick head that does some fancy lacing. There�s a caramel scent in the nose, but it�s somewhere beneath heaping piles of pine, grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine... a great blending of hops. The malt asserts itself in the flavor, a nice balanced blend with some intense hop bitterness that lasts way long into the finish. Most breweries would be greatful if they could come up with an IPA this good. Flossmoor Station, Flossmoor, IL
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"What Frankenkitty said! except I think the IBU""s might be pushing 80 or 90. Very, very sessionable! Citrus, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and pine...to the nines. And yet there is a substantial malt sweetness to anchor the whole thing. Very definitely a sessionable beer...in fact, I could use another one right about now! Great work Matt and Andrew!!!"
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at FSRB. Matt tells me they used 5 American hops in this: Cascade, Centennial, Amarillo, Simcoe and Summit, most of them late in the boil. And that�s what it tastes like. Big front load of piney hops with undercurrents of pineapple and orange. Oh, yeah: hazy golden beer under a thin lacy head. Smells like� oh, yeah, hops.And besides that, a caramel sweet malt base that tries to keep its strength up in the midst of all this hoppiness. Well, whether you like it depends on your mood for hops, and today, I�m in the mood. And if you wait a week, much those hops will be subdued.
Flossmoor Station 1906 Anniversary Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Served as a mid-hazed, copper/amber brew with a 3-finger, sudsy-yet-creamy head that stayed long and laced like a strip mine. Hops are highly evident as grapefruit in aroma and flavor, becoming a tad acrid in the latter. While we find a bit of a balance with an underlying thick base of sweet malts, I can still sense this approaching IPA territory. Mid-bodied with astringence to finish leaving the lasting impression of dried fruit on the tongue. Alcohol really crept up on me... two mugs before work was not one of my better ideas. Drinkable? Oh yeah. But I suspect the IBU�s in this baby are approaching 60 or 70, which may be a bit high for those without an affinity for hops. I personally found it highly enjoyable... congratulations on both the beer and the anniversary! On tap at Flossmoor Station, Flossmoor, IL 60422
