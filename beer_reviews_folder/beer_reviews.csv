Abita Bock;Abita Springs,Louisiana,United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;This reminds me more of a Pilsner or ESB vs. Bock. A lighter feel than the average in this style. Weak on the caramel malt. Flavor and feel barely above average. Actually one of the better Abitas that I've sampled                                       ,but just not good enough to want again.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs,Louisiana,United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a golden color with a small white head. Has a fruity malty caramel aroma. Fruity malty caramel flavor with hints of dark fruit. Has a fruity malty caramel finish.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs,Louisiana,United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle poured into a brandy snifter. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. Good head retention. Fruity and grainy aroma. The taste is lightly floral and bitter. A little bready. Everything seems muted in the taste. Aroma waa good,but taste just falls short. Medium body and medium carbonation.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs,Louisiana,United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle labeled “Mardi Gras Bock”. AROMA: Slightly sweet with scents of bread dough                                                                                                                                                                   ,malt                                                           ,and caramel. APPEARANCE: Pours a golden,clear amber with a tall,white head that dissipates slowly. TASTE: Slightly sweet with flavors of bread and caramel. PALATE: Medium-bodied but just a tad on the thin side. Carbonation is average. Finish is dry and has a (very) slight antiseptic taste. OVERALL: Better than your average “grocery store” beer,but by no means is a “great” beer. This is a beer that I would label as “premium pool party beer”. Meaning,people would be very impressed if you served this at your next pool party,but it would not impress your beer aficionados friends.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs,Louisiana,United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;"12 Fl Oz bottle (as Mardi Gras Bock) on 2nd Mar 2019 while staying with my daughter in Orange County, California. Clear and clean amber body, thin and wispy white head. Cinder Toffee aroma, sweet malty molasses in the flavour with caramel notes to the fore. Bought in a Trader Joe's, cooled and drank after a huge Pizza; I am stuffed, but still enjoying this beer as I write this, it's like my dessert I suppose."
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle at the house. Smell sweet and grainy. Light off-white head. Deep golden in color. Taste the grains and has a sweet taste to this beer. Light bodied with sweet after taste. Not what I was expecting, but pretty good. Good for a party beer. Cheers!
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;"Bottle labelled as ""Mardi Gras Bock"". Poured clear amber with a 3-finger off-white head. Mild, grainy aroma. Maybe a touch of caramel. Body is medium-to-full with a mildly dry finish. Stereotypical malty flavor, with nutty and caramel notes."
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;"Draught at Perch Brewery as ""Mardi Gras Bock"", 3/9/18. Clear, goldenrod-to-light-brass. Thin white head showing low retention. Waxy, vague, mineralesque nose does not feel anywhere near as malty as a bock should. Some vanilla, light honey, vague grain and light cereal really go nowhere and there's a touch of corn and alcohol lingering. In the mouth it's quite thin, bland, loose of texture and with an undermalted, borderline husky character and uninteresting, poorly developed flavors of vanilla, cereal and light, thin honey."
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;5/5/18: $1.66 + tax at Binny's. 12 oz pour into into chalice. Light copper bronze pour, one finger white puffy head, thin lacing remains. Light malt and cinnamon aroma. Very light negligible taste. Mild carbonation, thin texture. Won't seek this out again.
Abita Bock;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Abita Brewing Company;Clear gold. Grainy, full palate, sweet finish. Draft at the Brass Tap in National Harbor, Maryland.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;12oz bottle at home in a snifter. Very clear, golden amber pour with very little head. Aroma is mild caramel, Wurthers candies, un-iced doughnut, and butter. Taste is very mild (almost bland) caramel, butter, toffee, doughnut. Very thin mouth, rather slick oil. Pretty unimpressive.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from notes. Pours a clear dark golden/light brown color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have lightly toasted bready malts, straw, light fruit, mild earthy hops, rather bland.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Pours coppery orange with white foamy head and minimal lacing. An underwhelming fall ale that has very few aromas and tastes like citrus and sweet malts. My least favorite Abita beer so far.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Found this one to be a bit watered down. Aside from that it’s what you would expect from a fall beer - on the darker side, with a maltier taste. Was not impressed.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours with a crystal clear copper body that has thick gold edges and supports a thin mocha colored head. The aroma offers up winter spices, a spicy maple note and some malts. The taste has some nice winter spiciness and a bit of spicy maple like notes and then it slides deep into sugar sweet maltiness. Behind those notes are some sweet apple and pear like fruity esters that only build onto the sweetness. This would be more enjoyable if it had better balance between all the sweetness and the slightly roasty to spicy notes.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Aroma Is sour pissy, pilsner. Color is clear dark yellow. Zero head. Tastes is crisp hops and barley, but no depth. Sour aftertaste. Feel is flat. Disappointed. Poor beer. Yuck.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle from North Park Liquor store: Created a thin layer of film covering for a head while the color of the beer is a solid gold as if king Midas himself had touched the liquid. My nose detects a faint aroma of grained wheat and grassy hops with an ever present chance of alcohol. The flavor is bitter with minor amount of wheat like malt and very little notice of grassy sour notes of hops almost in a European like fashion. Overall, this is a poor attempt at a Marzen style, but this did come from Abita which hasn’t been known to impress me.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle into a glass. Pours amber. Aroma of skunkiness and sweet malt. Taste is skunkiness, cereal,a slight hop bite. Good boost level though.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Pours a clear amber color with a small head that fades to bits of lacing. Aroma is on the mild side with roasted malt, bit of malt sweetness and a bit of hops in the background. Taste of roasted malt, bit of caramel sweetness and a hint of chocolate. Has a subtle bitterness and a clean finish. Fairly medium body, crisp, quite smooth and refreshing. Not a fancy Oktoberfest, but still enjoyable.
Abita Fall Fest;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Abita Brewing Company;Draught @ The Ginger Man, NYC. Pours clear amber with smll off-white head. Clear aroma of malt with hoppy and estery touches. Sweetish, eatery flavour with a good deal of skunk and malt. Skunky aftertaste. Nothing really special.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;"A reliable and well-distributed beer in Norleans. Hoppier than most browns, and that;s important to me. Malt that's rich but not sweet, toasted grains, a tad of chocolate. Aroma more on the sweet side, with toffee and a little sawdust."

Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle share at Craft Beer Rising 2017, Brick Lane. Deep ruby and hazy with an offwhite head. Malty aroma with nutty and grassy notes. Flavour is a little on the sweet side with biscuity, cakey notes.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Draught @ Fox & Hounds, Sønderborg, Øllets Day 2019. Pours cloudy coffee brown with airy light tan head. Mild aroma of malt and yeast, with coffeelike touches. Bitter, roasty flavour with notes of hops and nuts and sweetish touches of yeast and malt. Roasty and nutty aftertaste with estery hints. Tame. Drinkable and reasonable but much less than what used to. e the standard for the brewery. Go back to your no le roots, Abita.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;This bottle is coming from the biervana, at Munich, enjoying and tasting this bottle, at home, at Epalinges, two days ago. The body is dark and brown, a bit troubled, normal carbonation, thin white and brown foam. In my point of view, it is a reasonable brown ale, not bad at all, with a touch of malt, nuts, bready, dry with a classical touch of hop, at the final.
Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle, 5.6%. Bready aroma. Very dark brown colour. Small light brown head. The flavour has some brown sugar. Low bitterness. Fruity finish.

Abita Turbodog;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Brown Ale;Abita Brewing Company;Bottle. 5.6%. Best before 01.10.20. Pours a clear, deep reddish amber/chestnut brown, with a light tan head. Okay lacing. Sweetish, (overripe) fruit and light malty aroma, with a hint of cooked vegetables. Remote hint of rubber as it warms, followed by a hint of nuts. Flavour is (dark) fruity, malty. Light metallic overtone. Bitter finish, hint of chocolate. A wee bit dry. Ashy hint. Mild alcohol burn. Lingering grassy note. Overall so-so. Generic and unbalanced. 22.07.19.

Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);18.04.2019 -- 0.5l can from geant casino in st louis, bb 03.2020. pours a clear deep golden with a frothy head. aroma of peat/whisky. flavour of peat, caramel, malts. bittersweet finish. too sweet and artificial.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Gefunden 2015 in einem Laden für französische Spezialitäten in Wien. Gebraut mit Whiskey-Malz. Das merkt man auch beim Geschmack -eine Malzigkeit, welche in einen ordentlichen Whiskeygeschmack inne hat. Mir persönlich ist das zuviel, da es schnell widerlich wird, da auch ein gammliger Fruchtgeschmack dazukommt. Nett anzuschauen, aber brauche ich nicht mehr.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Or sombre, ambré clair, limpide, mousse abondante et assez tenace, visqueuse et épaisse. Nez plutôt gourmand, brioché et sucré, dominante maltée. En bouche, c'est sucré, pas mal sucré pour un corps assez classique. Les arômes briochés sont là mais ce sucre, ça fait assez artificiel. Je ne sens ni fumé, ni grillé, rien d'une scotch ale. On est vraiment ans une bière aromatisée, qui malgré son sucre n'est pas écoeurante, mais se révèle plutôt cache-misère. Du sucre sur un fond de lager de base. Ce n'est pas aussi dégueu que dans mon souvenir (servi plus fraîche ?), mais c'est loin d'être bon.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Certes c'est une bière aromatisé avec du marketing dedans, mais ça marche bien. Belle robe rousse. Goût équilibré, un peu toasté avec une pointe de caramel et très légèrement fumé. Agréable.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Bottle from a bar in Juan les Pins. Barman smirked when I ordered this after a Leffe. Clear sign but it was the only tick. Bad. Flat beer with minimal hop and a chemical aftertaste that I guess was meant to be whisky. Not nice at all.
Fischer Adelscott;Rueil-Malmaison, France;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Heineken (France);Birra particolare con aggiunta di whisky. Profuma e ha un gusto molto particolare. O si ama alla follia o si evita. A me piace tanto.

Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Bottle at home. I used to drink loads of these, but this is the first since I started keeping records. This is a very good bitter and one that I would quite happily recommend to anyone. Lots of malt and balancing bitter hops with rich mouthfeel all wrapped up in a low abv. I had this with my Sunday roast dinner and it was a perfect match. A classic.
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Review from memory for personal records. Had a malt dominance, but cannot recall full tasting notes.

Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Bottle, local supermarket, from backlog. Poured dark amber to pale brown in colour with a small just off-white head. Aromas of hop, fruit, caramel, bread and light floral notes. Moderate sweetness and bitterness. Medium body, slight oily and watery texture, soft to average carbonation. Better than it’s replacement.
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;From old tasting notes. Originally labeled as Suffolk Extra Ale. Copper red color. Rocky beige head. Nice floral hop aroma. Dryish toasted malt flavor with a hint of spruce and spicy hops.

Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;Cask black rock wakefield. Dark amber colour. Good white head great lacing. Aroma is biscuity malts. Taste is malty bitter finish. Thin body. Nothing special about this one but ok.
Adnams The Bitter (Bottle/Can);Southwold, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Adnams;"@ Sergio’s Louisville Hazy dark amber with a 1/2"" head that lasts, dots and splotches of lace. Taste is caramel malt with molasses and dark toast that moves smoothly through the palate to a mild floral hop finish. Taste is far bigger than one would expect from 4.5% abv, a terrific session brew. Seeing that it is retired is unfortunate, and makes no sense (unless Broadside provides most of the sales?) Highly recommended."
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;Tried for the first time back in 2011 on a trip to the brewery. Pours golden, bright and clean. Nice floral hoppiness, some citrus finish. Just now getting to transferring the rating.
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;Light golden medium lace. Aromas citrus, pine. Flavors medium citrus, light pine, and almost no caramel balence. Mostly like an ipa. Lightly sweet and dry.

Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;Pours amber with thin cream head. Smells pretty floral and inviting. Taste is fairly subtle, a bit of hops, tastes very in the middle.
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;Aroma: light grain and cereal malts, some floral hops. Appearance: clear gold, small, frothy, white head. Taste: light bitter. Palate: lively carbonation, bitters continue, floral hops, grain malts in the finish. Overall: OK Golden Ale, quite light in palate. Pint at Kenai Fjords Glacier Lodge, Seward area.
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;"""how is Alaskan PALE ALE a blonde? Oh well. It’s a bit boring for a pale, but enjoyable and highly drinkable. I used to like it more, but since then have come to enjoy the ""bigger"" pales.

Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;August 12th, 2012 - Traveling in your 20’s should be day after day of walking, meeting quirky locals, and enduring hardships for the sake of experience. But when you travel with the family, it’s important to make concessions. Cruise ships are a little dull for those looking to put boot-to-dirt, even if you’re on a floating city plowing the waters around Alaska. However, my family made a concession for me when a few agreed to make the trip out to Alaskan Brewing Company with me. The facility is surprisingly small, but that left plenty of time in the tasting room taking in the relatively small offering on tap. I began with their Pale, a Golden Ale that clearly fit Alaska’s verdant summer better than their winter. It’s a a deep blonde with a small, frazzled head, and has a distinct Northwestern hoppy profile with gentle touches of grapefruit. The malt profile is gentle and light, masked partially by a fizzy carbonation, a short aftertaste, and a simplicity that lends this to being a sessionable brew.
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;A - pours clear darker golden straw with 1 finger white head. S - a quiet pale. Aromas of soap, pine needles, and tropical fruit. M - light with average carb. Some malty chewiness on the palate. T - tropical fruit, light soapy notes, lemon zest and pine. Very light bready and caramel malts. Some sort of sweet tart like chalky candy as well. O - nice an drinkable. Super simple blandish pale. 3
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;Best by 24JAN13 Pours light golden with a solid soapy white foam sheet. Smells of grass, lime, citrus some light grain. Simple nose. Taste is grainy, light malt, some golden raisins and juice with some hints of metal. A really simple, refreshing character. Light bodied with prickly, present carb and a dry finish. Nice beer, but more of a pilsner for the most part. Serving type: bottle 12-14-2012
Alaskan Pale;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alaskan Brewing Company;light orange. No head. Tangerine nose. Nice balance. I get bananas and jelly beans in taste. Pretty sweet. Maybe there’s a hint of walnuts
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;From Mar 2006 Poured from bottle(room temp) a reddish gold with a large head of foam that dissipated slowly. The smell is a sweet malt that has notes of caramel. The taste is a very nice balance between the malt and hops..both sweet and bitter notes are there but they work so darned well together that neither one takes center stage and that's the beauty of this ESB. Yum. Bottom line: A very solid ESB that I'll gladly drink more of and recommend.
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;This beer pours a copper color with a small ring around the top. The nose is citrusy hops, so much so its IPA like the moderate caramel malty backbone shows up after it warms. The flavor is pretty spot on with that nose, with the hops showing at first but then the bready caramel malts take over. Everything is pretty mellow, smooth with a touch of bitterness. Not a bad beer at all.
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;"""darker than most, with a slightly sweeter toffee/caramel thing going on before the slightly bitter finish. not bad, but not great. worth trying, especially if you’re an alaskan fan..."""

Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;Refrigerated 12 oz. brown squat bottle poured into an English pint glass. Clear copper with small beige head. Aroma is caramel malt/light herbal hops, medium body, low carbonation, and little small-bubble lacing. Taste is caramel malt, herbal hops, some floral hops, and bitter finish.
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;From bottle, pours a reddish amber with a big fluffy off-white head. Lots of fluffy lacing on the glass, too. Aroma is caramel and biscuit and floral hops. Taste is the same, moderately bitter, not particularly sweet, with a light bitter finish.
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle consumed in Redwoods Park. Red-amber; clear; very good tan head; excellent lacing. Has a layered, appealing aroma that mixes sweet baked grains with herbal/floral hops. Flavor: Given the aroma, there’s a rather bold hop note and lingering, moderately bitter aftertaste. Fruity and herbal. Feel: Lively medium-high carbonation. Medium body. O: bold and hoppy for style."
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;Beautiful to look at in the glass. Deep rust with a frothy head. In the mouth there is decent malt, but just a tad too much hops for me.
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;Aroma of sweet bread, and roasted malt. Nice copper amber with a tan head. Nice sweet, caramel malt up front. Notes of roasted malt, hints of toffee, and closes with a nice dry bitterness that blends perfectly with the malty begining. Finishes smooth. Nice example.
Alaskan ESB;Juneau, Alaska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Alaskan Brewing Company;Pours slightly hazy amber with small amount of white head. Aroma is roast, toffee and caramel. Nice caramel toffee malt body with a little bit of sweet floral hops. Easy to drink and pretty good.
Adler Brau Belgium-Luxembourg Mixed Up Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;"Dark orange color. Not much head. Very pleasing sweet smell. Wow, more complex than I'd expected. Some citrus taste (grapefruit maybe?), something kind of flowery as well. There's also a darker malty taste, possibly caramel. Goes down easily. This beer is a fantastic find from this tiny little brewery. I'm going to have to look hard for some more of this, as the store I got it at doesn't have it anymore, but it'll be worth the effort. By the way, the bottle says nothing about the beer itself, but gives the story behind the name: ""In Wisconsin many have wondered why there are so many Belgiums living in the town of Luxemburg, and so many Luxemburgs living in Belgium. As legend has it, the government was at fault. The town charters were mixed up when they were delivered."""
Adler Brau Belgium-Luxembourg Mixed Up Ale;Appleton, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Appleton Brewing/Adler Brau;Slightly hazy topaz color with a somewhat fluffy spritzy head. Sweet malt with a yeasty citrus and saaz floral aroma. Toffee and malt flavors which go to the spicy yeasty finish. A cross between a double, saison, special. No real style comes out but very good fermentation attenuation with differant yeast qualities.

PALATE: flat, heavy, medium-bodied; mildly effervescent and filling; slightly oily...TASTE: hints of toasted of some caramel, and muted hops; toffee is at the finish--subtle but enjoyable... OVERALL: a serviceable brown that drinks smoothly from the growler; indicative of of the genre but not outstanding..."

Barley Creek Antler Brown Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"Poured into a pint glass at 50 degrees full review at http://lownobudgetreviews.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/barley-creek-brewing-company-tannersville-pa-navigator-angler-and-antler/ (Ryan’s Reviews) In general, I’m not a fan of brown ales. I think they are… well… kind of boring. ANTLER pours a rich mahogany brown that lets off some red tones when held up to the light, and is a bit more visually appealing than many brown ales I’ve had. It’s capped with a fluffy off-white head that dissipates pretty rapidly and leaves just a bit of lacing behind. Taking a whiff, there is just not too much there. There is some nice maltiness, and a bit of nice medium body to the aroma. The taste is a pretty average brown ale flavor to me; the malt has a medium balance to it, neither too dark and astringent nor too light and golden. There are some hops on the back end, not much bitterness, and almost no hop aroma to speak of. The flavor has just a hit of nut – like walnut or hazelnut – and a very mild caramel undertone, which I wished were more pronounced. ANTLER is pretty thin and smooth, with very light carbonation, and not nearly as substantial as it looks. The body of the beer was not too much heavier than water, which for many would be a good thing; this makes ANTLER a very easy to drink beer, if this is your style. For me, brown ales are just not something I really enjoy, and ANTLER didn’t do too much to change my mind."
Barley Creek Antler Brown Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Nice malt sweetness on the nose. Pours lehigh brown. A hint of caramel on the tongue but fades quickly. All things being equal, I prefer my brown ale from Newcastle.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewery. Basic beer, malty and mildly hoppy. Not much flavor. Get it for your girlfriend.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"Amber no head; aroma is malty sweet; flava is vanilla malt; feels light slight fizz; finishes tangy mildly sweet"
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"Poured into a Jester King tulip at 50 degrees Full review at http://lownobudgetreviews.wordpress.com/2013/05/07/barley-creek-brewing-company-tannersville-pa-navigator-angler-and-antler/ (Ryan’s Reviews) NAVIGATOR comes out of the bottle a mix of gold and copper that is truly beautiful to look at and just LOOKS refreshing. A vigorous pours yields a pretty light head of bright white, rather large bubbles that fade away quickly. Taking it to my nose, I get a slight Hefeweizen like scent to NAVIGATOR; it’s got some banana notes and an overall mild bouquet. On the palate, NAVIGATOR starts somewhat sweet, but not overly so, and ends slightly bitter. It has a mild spice to it, and a Belgian undertone to the essence it brings. NAVIGATOR is not a tripel, but it is in the neighborhood… it’s almost like a tripel-light! It’s very light, and refreshing, and would make a good summer-outside-on-a-hot-day kind of beer. To add to this nice hot day note is the mouthfeel of the beer: NAVIGATOR is rich and slightly velvety without moving into being thick or heavy. I enjoyed NAVIGATOR, especially for a style that is not one of my favorites. Golden Ales are hit or miss for me; too many end up as an overpriced version of Budweiser, but NAVIGATOR is much more like a Belgian beer’s little brother. NAVIGATOR is great way to get a bit of the Belgian style without getting into the high ABV that a standard tripel normally packs, and on a hot day I take it hands down over the average American Adjunct Lager any day of the week. Of course, I’d also take water over AAL any day of the week, but you get my point…"
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Not a lot of aroma with this one. Color of straw and the taste of water. Leaves no lacing and has no palate.It doesn’t really do anything. Not a great start.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Had on draft at the brewery. Poured a clear gold color with slight fizzy white head. Aroma is bit sweet and grassy, but not much to it. Flavor reminds me of some homebrew extract cream ales I’ve made. Dry and bitter, with more body and flavor than most golds. Bit of lemon zest. Overall, decent on a hot day.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewery in Penn: For someone like myself who doesn’t particularly like the goldens, this one wasn’t half bad. Firm and malty on the palate. Very clean, very smooth. Nose is a little generic. Grassy and corn. Finishes with some decent hops.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Pours gold with a white head. Smells of bread, some toasted malt. Tastes grapey and sweet with some dryness on the finish.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;12oz. Bottle: Aromas of light apples, slight yeast, and grains. Poured amber in color with a medium-sized, loose, off-white head that diminished but lasted throughout. Cloudy. Sparkling. Full of small and medium-sized particles throughout. Flavor is slightly sweet and lightly bitter. Tastes of honey, grains, and a hint of Brett. Medium body. Average texture. Average to lively carbonation. Funky, Brett, honey, and grain finish.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Bottle: This beer was not very good. The flavor was sweet then sour then off. It was complex to the extreme. Not something I’d ever care to have again.
Barley Creek Navigator Golden Ale;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Weird tasting. I am officially putting down this company with this beer. It’s a 3rd beer, with a 3rd disappointment. I hoped to have a crispy smooth ale, what I found was a complicated taste. It was like yeasty apple juiced beer. Not pleasant in smell. Appearance was the best of the categories, with a nice head. It’s taste was just unusual. Palate was smooth. Wierd!!!
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);"This is my first cider review, so might be off on some things. I prefer the old school ciders that were unfiltered kinda like apple juice. When I describe a beer on here as ""looking like apple cider"", I am not referring to this light clear pale appearance. This looked like slightly colored water to me. Looked and tasted a lot like a white wine, but as I drank more of it I tasted the apple. I had a few hard ciders before this that I liked (which I'll resample and review), but this was my least favorite of the small bunch."
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);Aroma and flavor is apples, mild fruit and a mix of tart and sweet in the finish. Had several years ago, was unremarkable but drinkable.
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);A very old bottle that poured an amberish yellow color with aromas of tart apples, light vinegar, and driness. Flavors are the same dry aftertaste.
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);Yeah it’s a dry cider. It tastes like a Strongbow. I don’t know what else to say here.
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);I did not really think it was a beer, and to be honest with you i had very little of it. I gave the rest to my wife.
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);[Bottle] Pours a clear faint yellow color with no head. Aroma of tart apples and other light fruits. The taste is of apples and some vanilla. The body here was slightly better than I had expected. Prickly carbonation was reminiscent of sparkling wine. Had a dry finish, with white wine notes and light alcohol showing through. This was really not too bad.
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);Pours a clear gold color with some initial fizz that dissapears in under 10 seconds. A few bubbles continue to rise, but overall stillness. Aroma is tart sour apples. Flavor reminds me a lot of the apfelwein I make. Lots of tart apple juice flavors but with a dryer less boozy finish. Overall, enjoyable.
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);Pours clear pale yellow with a thin head. Aroma is light apple, honey and grain. Taste is thin and light apple. Easy drinking, not so apple-y as others.
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);"Pours a lasting ring of white head with an extremely pale, almost clear body. Aromas of golden delicious apples. Flavor is golden delicious, reminding me of sparkling n/a cider, not as sweet though. Some chardonnay qualities. ""Rather dry"" finish."
Cider Jack Hard Cider;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Vermont Hard Cider Company, LLC (C&C Group);Bottle pours pale yellow-green with an almost non-existent white head. Aroma is apple, pear, and a slight amount of plastic. Flavor is tart apple and what seems like a small amount of wood. The body is light, the finish is dry, and the carbonation is almost equivalent to that of a champagne. Definately a more european style of cider and a decent one at that. Based on some of the reviews, it seems as though they have been playing with this recipe. People mention sweet but this is one of the driest ciders i’ve had in a while.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Originally rated July 2006. This lager is gold in colour with tiny bubbles coming up from 3-4 different spots. The white head is small and does not last very long. Pleasant nose of cereal malts and slight roasted ones. Crisp mouthfeel, quite refreshing. Taste of corn and malt throughout with a mild bitterness in the finish. Nothing exciting, but a tad better than most macro lagers.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;341mL bottle poured pale golden color with small white head settling to spotty lacing. Aroma is malts and some hops. Taste is lightly sweet malt with a mild hop bitterness in the finish. Similar to most macros, except a little more grain malt and smoother finish.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Oooold review from some point in the summer of 2006. Poured out a clean light gold brew with bubbles. Somewhat smells like cereal with a bit of stink, grains and a faint fruit. Ok taste when cold. Grains, corn and light fruit - mostly malty and a hint of bitterness. Drink it quick while it’s drinkable. Fizzy.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Kold Lager--2000 11.5 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV. (3.75 / 5.0) Pilsner. Very clear light golden color.

Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Pours a nice light golden yellow. Aromas of hops, grass, and maybe some light malt.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;I’m not as upset with this beer as the majority of raters. It is definitely Big Rock’s least appealing offering, but it isn’t horribly bad, just pretty avergage. Macro pale lager style, with the only difference being a heavier malt presence, which, to say it again, isn’t bad.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;12oz bottle acquired in trade with BlankBoy (thanks - especially for letting me knock off anohter Province!). Poured a lighter and see through golden color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of grain, light citrus and some honey sweetness. Tastes of pretty much the same. Thin and on the watery side. Very much on the boring side.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;341ml brown bottle. Golden with a small white cap. Sweet malts in the aroma. Very mild malt flavour with very faint citrusy hops, some grains. Light thin body, light carbonation.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Another purveyor that the water used makes a big difference. Well, its not bad in a pinch New Year’s Eve. But it is forgettable and plain, though some malt and even a hop or two for taste. More than a thin mouthfeel, so better than average for its style. Understated carbonation was appreciated.
Big Rock Köld;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;"Bottle. Pours a clear almost flat light gold with a spare diminishing white head. Quite poor looking. The sweet aroma of malt, grain and yeast is stale. The flavour’s even worse: crappy macro sweet grain Lager taste. ""Made from pure glacial water""? Give me a break. This is crap."

Big Rock Grasshopper Kristallweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Appearance is clear and bubbly with a bright yellow color to it, pours with a finger and a half of thin white head that fades rapidly but leaves a bit of a skim on the surface of the glass and leaves lightly clingy, slightly watery lacing. Aroma is lightly grassy hops with a faint wheat note on the back end. Very lightly grassy/ hay flavored hop note forward with a ghostly hint of citrus to it. Nice clean and easy drinking with a mildly wheaty malt body with a faint honey sweetness to it. Clean finish with ghostly yeast hints in the back end and faint citrus notes on the aftertaste. Light bodied and easy drinking with a higher then average carbonation to it. Not bad but a pretty standard pub beer with out much stand out character to it.

Big Rock Grasshopper Kristallweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Big Rock Brewery;If you are expecting a lovely murky wheaty beer, this isn’t it... Kristall it may be, but the wheat is minimal - more like a pilsner with a bit of doughy ’warm bread’ aroma. Poured cold from a bottle into a glass, it has that slight aroma of not-very-fresh bread which dissipates even though there is minimal foam and almost no lace. The colour is a nice gold-amber though, and clear, unlike the usual hefeweizen. I found it a bit sweet to start - light, getting heavier down the glass. Like most N American beers it leaves a lingering sticky feeling, making me want a glass of water... obviously it isn’t thirst-quenching in that respect. Perhaps I’ll revert to a practice I learned in Edmonton of adding a dash of salt (presumably to replace the dehydration in summer days, but it did add sweetness to the beer)... purist may yell, but right now I’m ambivalent towards it. Light of body, sticky aftertaste, average carbonation with a long thick finish, medium sweetness, and slightly sour,

Big Rock Warthog English Style Mild Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Brown Ale;Big Rock Brewery;"341ml bottle from Beer Store in Toronto. This beer is exactly what it says it is: an English style mild ale. A rich body that goes down easily, with very little bitterness. Serve at 10 - 15 degrees C, of course. Don’t be fooled by the name ""Warthog"" ... it’s not an aggressive ale - as the commercial description explains, it is designed to quench the thirst of an English big game hunter on an African safari!"

I’ve tried this beer so many times over the years, but I’m just not getting any closer to liking it. It’s malt-heavy, which would be fine, but for that sour something I can’t quite identify.

Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;I have to rate this even though it is retired, and I last had it just over a year ago. I feel justified in that I used to drink a lot of this stuff, along with Canvasback, before I moved to Australia for a while. When I got back, they had retired them both, but I’ve still got a handsome set of beer glasses with the logos on them. Anyway, from what I recall, this had maybe a shadow of pale ale character at most, certainly nothing like the beautiful American pales that we get from our microbrewing neighbours to the south (and a select few Canadian ones too-- Tree Brewing for example). A beer that holds some sentimental fondness for me though.
Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Had this one on tap at Mcnally’s Tavern in Regina. Not a lot to say here, standard Big Rock brew. Golden colour, dry drink and a nasty aftertaste.

Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;deep golden colour. faintly perfumy aromas. sweet malt flavour. very mild bitter finish. mild for a pale ale, even by canadian standards. bleh.
Big Rock Chinook Pale Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Fruity and flowery aromas, amber, mild malt taste, hint of hops, nothing special.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;As I remember this beer, it does not bring great joy. Watered down version of previous beer, this brewery can do better. (Calgery, some years ago)
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Oh light AGD. Reviewed straight from old school blue and gold can, aesthetically pleasing. Poured some out to note clear, yellowy colour. Medium carbonation. Aroma is corn and grass. Taste is exactly the same, with a bubbly mouthfeel of plain, grainy beer. Light watery piss.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Colour: Extremly light...almost white/yellow with decent head. Nose: Yeast, tin can, mild oats. Taste: Lot’s of malt, light cereal fade and sugar cream light finish. Better than a coors light. Creamy palate.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Not good. Skunky, tasteless water. Horrible corn, skunk, grass aroma and flavor. Not the best light crap beer out there.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;As far as light brews go, this one is decent enough, despite lacking real flavour, aroma and colour. Nearly invisible clear pee yellow, some large bubbs, near zero head, no lacing. Aroma of barley. Taste is kind of harsh with lots of bitterness. Barley, water, hops. Mouthfeel is rough - way too spritzy. Thin and watery - obviously. Ends dry with some unknown aftertaste. Read the fine print to find out that Big Rock spawned this liquid.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;This is Alberta Genuine Draft with whatever meager life it has sucked out of it. It ranks among the palest beers I’ve seen, with no aroma and literally no flavour. It is like vaguely grainy soda water. Astonishingly bland.
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;"Now called Alta Light with 4% alcohol. Darkish yellow. Minimal head. Strong carbonization. Thin aroma. Subtle hop perhaps. It is not badgor what it is, just another lightly flavoured low alcohol ""lite beer""."
Big Rock Alta Light;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Rock Brewery;Better than I thought it would be. But that's not to say that I recommend it.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;"Draught at Big Rock Urban Brewery, Vancouver Golden colour; creamy mouthfeel, corn flavour, not much evidence of rye; clean but with no emotions."
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;[9313-20170625] Bottle. Mild rye cereal grains aroma. Light golden body with a quick foamy off-white head. More sweet cereal grains and rye bread crumbs in the flavour. Medium body. Interesting. (6/3/7/3/13) 3.2
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;2017-06-25. Quick notes: Aroma of sweetish grains. Flavour is similar, moderate cereal grains, light caramel notes. Average bodied palate, good carbonation. Simple but okay. 6/3/6/3/13-14 Bottle shared by K&V.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Light golden body, white head. Sweet grainy aroma. Faint sweet grain taste. Pretty much like a pale lager. Not great.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Big Rock doesn't venture too far from their tried and true recipe. This makes all their beer taste very similar, while it's good, it's nothing new or special. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours copper with a nice sized white head. Aroma of rye, malt, sweetness, and dough. Taste of the same with the doughness becoming more prominent. This medium bodied brew is not bad.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Clean red color with almost zero head and no carbonation. Cheap nose, lots of corny aroma, slightly sweet and if rye is present its hard to find. Flavor starts off with a sweet corny presence at the start and a very light watery rye shows up in the middle with a metallic finish. Body is light, flat and boring. Overall a huge miss in my opinion. A very bad rye ale in this raters opinion. The rating, albeit low, is still a bit generous.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Deep clear gold, vanishing white head. Malty caramel nose, tastes of caramel malts, spice and some fruit... an I & G wannabe?
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Bottle 5%. The pour is copper coloured, weak bubbly foam appears. The aroma is of rye, quite grainy, hint of malty sweetness. Overpowering breadiness, creamy mouthfeel, very dry and grainy into the finish. Interesting, but no lasting excitement.
Big Rock MagPie Rye Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Specialty Grain - Other;Big Rock Brewery;Not the same beer that I remember trying about 10 years ago. Poured from a 341mL bottle a pale golden color with small white head and spots of lacing. Aroma of grains and some grassy hops. Taste is lightly sweet malt with a light dry grassy hop finish. Decent carbonation and body give a nice mouthfeel.
Big Rock Canvasback Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;341mL bottle poured pale amber color with small white head and minimal lacing. This one has a mild aroma of some floral hops and cereal. Taste is mild malt and some nice floral hops in the finish. An easy drinking beer that is a little more complex in flavour than your standard lager and has a cleaner finish, with none of that cheap bitter aftertaste.
Big Rock Canvasback Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Canvasback Canadian Ale--1998 22 oz. Bottle. 3.50% ABV. (2.0 / 5.0) Golden Ale. Very light golden color with almost a lager flavor. Light weak body. Mild aroma hops, but not much else. Sampled 4/11/1998.
Big Rock Canvasback Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;"I don’t normally rate a beer ""from memory"", but I feel I have to rate this even though it is retired, and I last had it just over a year ago. I feel justified in that I used to drink a lot of this stuff, along with Chinook, before I moved to Australia for a while. When I got back, they had retired them both, but I’ve still got a handsome set of beer glasses with the logos on them. Anyway, from what I recall, this had maybe a shadow of pale ale character at most, certainly nothing like the beautiful American pales that we get from our microbrewing neighbours to the south (and a select few Canadian ones too-- Tree Brewing for example). I remember Canvasback having a darker amber appearance than Chinook, with a somewhat fruitier palate. A beer that holds some sentimental fondness for me though."
Big Rock Canvasback Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Rock Brewery;Golden color, fast fading white head. Light in body and taste, although you can detect the Big Rock signature yeast. Not one of the best from this Brewery

Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Aroma: like roasty notes pretty subtle aroma Taste: roasty dry malt flavors with light smoky notes.Finishes with smooth malt8ness Appearance:clear dark amber with bubbly whote head with medium retention
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Color is deep dark brown withquickly dissapearing light brown foam head. Aroma is malty, bread roasted and some chocolate. Tashe is bittersweet, toast and chocolate. More of a German Alt then a stout. (Velp)
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Draft @ Korea Location: Poured a deep black with a tan color head. Aroma is thick licorice and roasted malt. Taste is a bit sourish with some aging roasted malt.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;341mL bottle stated 7%ABV on the label poured a deep dark brown color with a thin beige head and very light lacing. Aromas of roasted malts and chocolate and some alcohol. Taste is malty sweet and chocolate with some hop bitterness and alcohol in the finish. The body is a little thin for a stout, but overall, this is a pleasing well balanced brew.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Bottle, sampled at Viti, pours dark reddish brown. Aroma of roasted malt, caramel and a little chocolate. Roasted flavours dominate with coffee and chocolate, and subtle fruitiness, but all watered down. How this is classified as a stout is beyond me. Drinkable.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;***Old rating as I score all the Big Rocks I’ve had and never rated*** Pours a dark mahogany colour with a thin layer of off-white head which dissipates quickly leaving no real lacing. Scent is a smokey espresso with a slightly sweet caramel finish, but still rather mild, much like the other Big Rock flagship offerings. I would have to say that this is one of the more flavourful Big Rock offerings. The espresso malts come through, a bit of bitter dark chocolate and bit of a wooden rye flavour is also coming through. Again, it could be a bit more bold, but by far one of their most flavourful beers. A nice medium bodied offering that goes down smooth. No complaints in this department. Overall, this is by far one of the better Big Rock offerings, and I would definitely choose this one over their other beers if I were given the choice. A little light on the flavours and scent, but a decent stout nonetheless.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Black Amber Ale, Dark Alberta Stout--1999 11.5 oz. Bottle. 5.00% ABV. (4.0 / 5.0) Porter? Deep rich clear cherry copper color. Malty aroma light toasted front. Dry malty body with earthy roasted light fruit flavor and spicy notes. Chocolate flavor appears gently and more towards end. Sampled 5/26/1999.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Amber Ale? Stout? I agree w/ Cirrhosis, this seems to scream Porter, but I’ll rate it as a Stout just for giggles. Bottle. 5%. Dark, dark brownish copper poor with a weak tan foam that bubbles away super quickly. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, and caramel. Taste is roast malts, with a hint of caramel sweetness. Carbonated mouthfeel for a stout, but finish is dry, quite bitter, and satisfying. $11.99/6 @ Wild Rose Liquor.
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;I am a big supporter of Big Rock beers. I have been for 15 years. This one however just seems to be off the mark for them. I always expect so much more for a stout. It has the expected dark mocha, coffee nose but just seems to fall flat in the mouth. Nowhere is the rich amber sweetness and even less present is the powerful malt stout character. It is not terrible but it certainly could be a better product. It does have their usual expert carbonation and palate feel, thank goodness!
Big Rock Black Amber Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Big Rock Brewery;Don’t like this stuff. Good job on trying to peak the interest of non-educated drinkers by calling this an amber ale and a stout at the same time. Dark dark red / brown with nearly zero head poured. Aroma is not bad, I just know where they are going with this beer. It really took a long time for the aroma to come around to something worthwhile: toasted malts, cigarette smoke, chocolate and dark coffee faintly appearing. This stuff is terrible when cold. Taste is pretty good now that it’s nearing room temperature, but before was borderline. Nice malts and bitter hops are blended well, some notes of caramel and some spice. Mouthfeel is light to medium, flat but spritzy (??) with a touch of alcohol, and a dry pleasant bitter aftertaste. I like it now, but it’s been in my glass now close to an hour. It took that long to make it good. I like it better than the numbers indicate. I’ll drink this again, but only an hour out of a fridge. Other than that, a highly dissapointing misguided beer. I think I’ll go see if Big Rock has a non-alcohol IIPA Gueuze...
Heineken;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Heineken Nederland;Not my first choice of beer but if it’s there I will happily drink it. Has a nice refreshing taste with little to no bad aftertastes. Makes me wanna get with a broad from Europe.

Heineken;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Heineken Nederland;Fresh draft in Amsterdam. This is not the export version. This local NL version tastes much better.

Brewed in Greece with Greek water. Had in a local restaurant in Naxos town. Pours a clear golden colour with a white head. Aromas of sweet malt. Tastes of sweet malt, barley & grains. Reasonable for a macro

Amstel Light;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;Bottle from friend. Pours yellow with a white head. Smells skunky as shit. Tastes a lot like Heineken in that it doesn't like much.
Amstel Light;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;Out the bottle smell of malt and crisp grain. Taste is the bite of a bitter grain. Palate is short, washing away into mineral carbonated water aftertaste and slight acidity.

Amstel Light;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;at Least 100 bottles over the last 15 years. Pours pale golden with average head. Notes are wood, toast, skunk, lemon, and ash. Not much depth or florals but its light and refreshing at a dumpy bar.
Amstel Light;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;"12 ounce bottle into lager glass; bottled on 9/11/2018, best before 9/2019. Pours crystal clear pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with awesome retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a lightly amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit of fruity/skunky aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, toasted biscuit, light corn, wood, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes present. Moderate increasing dryness from bitterness. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, and moderately bready/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.5%. Overall this is a good light lager. All around nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/drying finish. Flavorful and not too watery for the ABV. Nice pils malt/grain showcase, with great earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Mild on the corn/adjunct presence. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example all around."
Amstel Light;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;The Aromas are pale malt, wet grain, stereotypical pale lager characteristics. Flavors are like nose, more sweet with a hint bitter and some carbonation to balance. Very little going on. Also very boring. This is another one of the beers that I've rated in the past and somehow ratebeer has canceled my former review.

Amstel Gold;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Heineken Nederland;Wat ik mij hiervan kan herinneren is dat het alcoholpercentage wat hoger lag dan de gewone pilsener, en dat als je het is je glas schonk de schuimkraag na het knipperen van je ogen alweer was vertrokken. De smaak deed wat appel en perzikachtig aan met een plakkerig zoet mondgevoel en een irritante alcoholgeur die van het bier afkwam. Nee mensen, dit was niet best.

Amstel Gold;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Heineken Nederland;Is dit wel dezelfde Amstel Gold uit die ranke flesjes, die vroeger het enige redelijke alternatief bij mening chinees restaurant waren?

Amstel Malt;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;The label 'malt' denotes n/a beers in the Netherlands... but malt is one of the things you don't taste much of in this brew, another being hops. Funnily enough, I can easily tolerate this beer in a café on the Dutch coast, but would never dream of buying it at home. I suppose my beer expectations are generally pretty low in the Netherlands, thanks to Heineken. Perhaps it is time to invest a little effort and find a good Dutch beer - I'm sure they exist.

Nose very neutral, only a slight sweetish maltiness; same for the taste, neutral, just a tad malty, mouthfeel very watery, practically no finish at all, just a very faint and very brief bitterishness. Not off-putting but bordering on tasteless and therefore completely pointless, like most alcohol-free ’beers’."
Amstel Malt;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;bottle @ a restaurant in Haarzuilens. Golden color white head higher carbon beer. Bittersweet taste, bitter aftertaste.

Amstel Malt;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Heineken Nederland;Somewhere between a pale lager low alcohol beer and a malt drink. Medium amber with no head to speak of. Smells of malt, cabbage, grain, sour and sweet caramel sugar. Medium thin body with soft carbonation. Tastes of sweet malt and caramel like a malt drink but with a cardboard and forced carbonation club soda element. The sweetness dominates as as a lover of malt drinks this isn’t half bad. One thing to note is that my bottle is one year and three months over date which may explain why the carbonation is soft and the some of the likely poorer elements subdued.

Amstel Bock;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Heineken Nederland;Аромат очень хлебный и дрожжевой. Также есть небольшие ноты жженой карамели соответственно солода с намеками на мед. Цвет темно коричневый, пенка пышная, серая. По телу сразу понятно что пиво с характером. Ощущаются ноты хлеба, при чем так и белого так и черного. Карамель есть но быстро исчезает, больше сходит на ирис что ли. Алкоголь немного есть на языке при глотке. Такое добротное среднее крепкое пиво, есть нотки от стилей вроде дупель бока. Неплохо для массового пива.

Anchor Steam Beer;San Francisco, California, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);"Very interesting and refreshing beer to drink in the summer.. It remind me little bit some belgium beers on the colour and on the taste like ""Pauwel Kwak"" and ""Leffe Blond"" but with much more higher carbonation.. And yes the carbonation here is insane and that little trouble you to get some more flavors.. The taste is more on the bitter direction and specially in the aftertaste that you get high rate bitterness.. And is a very malty beer.. Overall is a decent beer to drink in the summer everywhere you are.. Is better from the most ""Lager"" beers out there and that is the fact.."

Rich taste as well, dark fruit, chocolate, and smooth initially, with some bitterness coming through in the middle, leading to a relatively dry finish and bitterness lingering on the tongue, along with the very flavorful malt body - again, hints of caramel, chocolate, dark fruit, and roasted malts. The body is medium, tending toward substantial, especially for a porter. Overall, a well-constructed porter. Rich and complex flavor, good body, roasted malts complemented by sweet caramel, raisins, and chocolate, moderated by the hop bitterness. The finish is relatively dry, but with hints of the sweetness remaining. Top notch. Extremely enjoyable and flavorful.

Anchor Porter;San Francisco, California, United States;Porter;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);"I expecting much more things from that ""Porter"" and from that ""Brewery"" but it seems is not for me.. All beers from them had one specific character inside that trouble me.. They have some kind ""Hoppy"" and some extra bitterness and that is not my cup of tea. Anyway this ""Porter"" it taste completely different against the ""Fuller's porter"" that is the king of the style.. Is much more bitter than sweet and has more carbonation inside.. Also you can feel less coffe and chocolate here and some kind extra bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall i can't be objective with that beer and these breweries from ""U.S"" that have some extra ""Hoppy"" character.. If you like the ""Hoppy"" and bitter beers definitely try this one.."

The nose was a malty sweet, Barleywine-like scent, dark fruit as plum & prune, subtle holiday spice, and a touch of lurking alcohol? Light to medium bodied, the taste was similar notes, and also included a slight woody/cedar hint? Texture was a little thinned, and there was almost no effervescence, but that was okay with me. Turned out to be a fairly tasty & successful cellar experiment, with no noticeable oxidation, and just reduced, all around character.

Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Poured a pale straw color with a foamy, bright white head that shrunk to a thin sheet in moments. The nose was sweet and musty with caramel, wheat, rice and corn. The taste started with an wheaty/oakiness followed by a welcome sweetness that tried to balance out the unpleasant, astringent-esque, wooddiness. The end had a dark tasting bitterness and was followed by a mustiness that seemed to last from beginning to end. The mouthfeel was light and the CO2 was a little coarse. Although light and drinkable, I had no desire to try this again. A disappointing offering from Anchor. Maybe my expectations were too high.
Anchor Wheat Beer 3.9% (-2008);San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);I love this stuff. My local 19th hole got this as a mistake many years ago and I went back every night to get more.

Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;About 35 years ago, i could find many equal or even better tripel beers.

Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;"A very unique and a different ""Tripel"" from the others of the style.. This beer remind you little the ""Red"" and the ""Blue"" from the same ""Brewery"" but at 80% is a completely different beer. First of all is a very strong and punchy beer with high rate carbonation but that can't distract you to get the flavors.. All here playing a role and made this beer amazing.. The alcohol is very well hide and the fruity taste of the beer cover it very good...For sure very balance beer and one of the best of the style and in general.. It's rich, punchy, refreshing with amazing taste and great aftertaste.. Overall i believe is the most balance from the ""Chimay"" series.. You can drink it any season you want dispate the weather outside.. Is rich and warming very well your mouth and also is very refreshing.. Combined two differents things and that is the fact for me.."
Chimay Triple (Blanche / White);Baileux, Belgium;Tripel;Chimay;Big 750 ml bottle. Beautiful clear orange/amber color with an initially big puffy white head (apparently from very energetic carbonation) that seems to die quickly. Belgian yeast, light sugar sweetness and a light mustiness in the aroma. Unlike a lot of Tripels, this one is not that sweet and has a fairly light body. Just a touch of vanilla in the taste, but mostly a sharp (and delicious) bitterness of dehydrated oranges and citrus peel. The balance here though is quite nice if a bit on the thin side. There's some heat, but not what I would expect from a Triple. Finishes dry, woody and pithy with a lasting bitter bite all over the mouth. Not what I was expecting, but definitely a very well made and enjoyable beer.
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Cask (handpump) at the Great British Beer Festival Day 3, August 2006. Dark brown with a red tinge. Slightly sulphurous aroma. Quite tart with an acidic, vaguely lactic finish. Lots of malty fruit in the flavour. Difficult to place style-wise - as much like a porter, or even an old ale, as a stout. An interesting and quite agreeable beer.
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Cask, Newark Winter Fest 09. Near black with red tints and a beige foam. Aromas are earthy roast malts with chocolate and yeast. Flavours are roast coffee malts wit light berries. Bitter towards the finish. Peppery. OK.

Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);It was on summer. Got it at GBBF 2008. It was very good and not tiring. NIce heavy grains taste.
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Cask (named St Lawrence Ale) from the Central Southern England section at GBBF. Naked, dark-brown body.

Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Cask@GBBF2008 (as St. Lawrence Ale). Amber colour, mediumsized brown head. Sour wood and berries in aroma along with some smoked wood. Flavour is much the same. Some oak as well. Bitter and dry in the finish. Something in the aroma and flavour makes me not like it too much
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Dark brown with large beige head. Sweet aroma with roasted malt, coffee and oak. Very roasted flavor with bitter coffee, oak and hoppy notes. Ends bitter with good dryness.
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Bottle.Is this really a stout or a dark bitter-my money is on the latter. Pored with a small head with a pleasant and subtle maltiness. Nice dry fiinnish. Drinkable and pleasant.
Yates Wight Winter;Sandown, Isle Of Wight, England;Stout;Yates (Isle of Wight);Cask at GBBF 2006 as Yates St. Lawrence Ale. A very dark brown beer with a reddish shine and a rim of brown head. The aroma is sweet malty combined with notes of caramel, and light notes of hops. The flavor is sweet with strongest notes of caramel, but also some malt notes. OK, but nothing special.
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);500ml bottle in 2015. Black with a beige head. Aroma of roasted malt, light coffee and vanilla. Medium to full body. Some nice roasty notes. A lot better without the nitrogen!
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Good thing I checked database. This is the Guinness they have in my office in Belfast. Quite roasty and more earthy than states. More herbal characters. Smooth and thin less creamy than pasteurized which I guess makes sense
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);A average, light tasting stout. Malty and toffee aroma and taste. Some sweet, fruity and fragrant notes, with light malts and coffee stout flavour. Very carbonated. But not as smooth or strong as other stouts.
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);"Flasche 0,5l (as 'Extra Stout' - ABV: 4.1%): Schwarz, trüb mit kräftigem stabilen Schaum; die Nase angenehm mit leichter Süße, kräftigem Malzzucker, dunklen Beeren, schwarzen Kirschen, Röstaromen; würziger Antritt, cremig mit angenehmer Bitterkeit und einem trocken-würzigen Nachgang"
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);500ml bottle brewed in Dublin at 4.2%. Stonking pale-beige Guinness microbubble head, developing Swiss-cheese type cavitation and eventually remaining for a very long time as thin froth. Faint pear and toffee aromas. Dark brown so as to be off-black. Low carbonation. Dark chocolate sweetness and roast coffee bitterness battle it out to coat your mouth. Classic tasty porter experience.
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);(Bottle) Pours black with big tan head. Nice aroma of smoke, nuts, roast malt. Light body and rather fizzy. Taste of roast malts, some dark toffee and tartness. Rather disappointing (I expected more for a Guinness brewed in Dublin), but very drinkable.
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Dark amber color with small brown head. Roasted malt and coffee aroma. Bitter malt taste.
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Quite a difference from the can or draught version. Pours really dark brown with tan head. Higher carbonation feel than the draught. Still smooth and full of flavour though. Mostly bitter with some sweetness present. Very drinkable
Guinness Original 4.2% (Ireland/UK);Dublin, Ireland;Stout;St. James's Gate (Diageo);Bottle from the Lazy Dog. Dark brown in color with a hint of garnet and a decent sized tan head that slowly recedes. Earthy roasty and light cocoa with bits of licorice and dark dried fruits. Pretty tasty easy to drink stout.

Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;12oz bottle, at the hotel before a Braves game. Clear light brown with a thin white head. Some caramel and toffee notes, bready malt. Light bodied, medium carb. Sweet finish. (notes)
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Copper red color. Big fluffy beige head. Interesting, earthy toasted malt nose. Tangy malt flavor hints at curry and cardamom. Good flavor.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a moderately dark orange to ruddy brown color with a finger’s worth of messy foamy head. Dissipates at a nice level pace and leaves some stringy lace sliding right on into the beer. The aroma leans to the sweet side with some roasty nuts, caramel and toffee malt goodness. Dosed with some earthy hops far underneath. The flavor once again, leans to the sweet side and grabs the earthy hops to try and balance a bit more. Do they? Well, somewhat. I feel like I’m grasping at straws trying to find something more out of this beer. No aftertaste but a quick clean sweet malty finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation feels decent on my tongue. Overall, decent as an English brown ale and I could see myself coming back to if given the chance but not exactly a superior one of it’s style.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Rating from old records. From bottle in shaker: aroma could be mistaken for a good candy bar. Malt-driven taste that finishes a bit sweeter than an English Brown.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Pours a nice dark brown color. Aromas of nuts/chocolate/caramel. Flavor is nutty with a nice sweet honey chocolate taste and a little coffee bitterness.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Rated base on notes taken 20 Feb 2012 -- This is a very drinkable and flavorful brown. Lots of malt, hint of roast. Greatness.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Bottle. This is a decent brew for getting together with buddies on the weekend. Other than that give it a miss.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;On tap at the World Beer Festival - Columbia on 01/22/2011 (As Red Brick Brown). Clear dark amber body with a small off-white head. Sweet toast and earthy aroma. Light nutty and toffee flavor with some graininess. Medium body with moderate carbonation.
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Bottle - Pours a murky brown w/ white head, little retention. There is a light hint of caramel, toffee, and chocolate in the nose. The taste is a bitter chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts. Decent beer
Red Brick Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Brown Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Pours an orangey dark brown with a frothy white head on top. Has a coppery aftertaste. A decent beer, not my favorite in the brown ale catagory but a decent offering from a smaller brewery.
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;12oz bottle Old notes. Poirs a clear golden with a decent white head. Aroma of slight hops. Taste of hops and malt. This light bodied was nothing to write home about.

Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;Tap at airport. I didn’t catch the Marijuana unfortunately, it only would have served to improve this specimen. Yellow and fizzy. No real Saaz bite. Thin and bland. I suppose if the SE US is a beer wasteland then this is a true outpost. I wish Dogwood were at the airport instead!!!
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;I too sampled this at the Atlanta Airport. It is an interesting sample for one reason - a reason I find it humorous that no one has of yet seen fit to writingly observe here on Ratebeer.com. It smells - and tastes - like marijuana. I have never had any beer like this. I would not say it was good - but I was surprised as anything by its druggy aroma and potent, somewhat offensive taste. The beer head [Schaum] did not remain very long, nor was it very thick or creamy like I like it. This was a disappointing but memorable beer. One good thing about it I guess is that it is 5.5%, slightly above average in percentage of alcohol content. The Red Brick Ale is slightly better in taste, but still not very good.
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;On tap in the Atlanta Airport. Good honey gold appearance with a poofy head. Very light aroma, what was there was a bit hoppy. I was disappointed with this beer, even though I was looking to sooth my jangled flying nerves. Robustly hopped and somewhat yeast-moldy, moderate sweetness. Body went a bit watery in the end, and the aftertaste didn't hang around. The overall effect of the beer was a bit clumsy.
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;Had on tap at their brewpub in Concourse T at the Atlanta Airport. Light golden appearance, nice lacing - had a sweet citrusy honey aroma to it. Bold, crisp flavor for a lager. A little too much carbonation in the finish, however.
Red Brick Golden Lager;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Red Brick Brewing Company;Similar in taste to the Goose Island Pils, that is, very sweet. Some hops but not as much in the tradition of the style as I would have hoped for.

Red Brick American Wheat;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;A very boring and unsatisfying wheat beer. Cloudy and pellucid with no head, and little aroma. Taste is very one-sided, and absolutely nothing to write home about.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;Pours dark brown with some dotty, sparse carbonation. Smells of roasted malt and vinous. Tastes of roasted malt with some tartness on the finish.

Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;(Bottle, courtesy of mar) Pours a dark brown body with a small beige head. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, oatmeal, and coffee. Flavor o roasted malt, coffee, and cocoa with a dry, bitter finish.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;12oz bottle. I’m assuming this one is an ’03 since the photo matches my bottle vs. the picture in the ’04 (and I’ve had the ’04 label too). If they re-did the old lable on the newer bottle, just let me know! Poured a dark brown color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of roast, lots of oatiness, earthy, and a trace of coffee. Tastes of roast, oats, earthy, and chocolate.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;This was actually pretty good. Lots of sweet maltiness, rich chocolate and cocoa, but has an acrid flavor like the tar from the bottom of an ashtray. Light cotton candy spices here and there, and a bit of orange zest. This beer is an absolute trainwreck.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;bottle thanks to rollinhard. black pour with a thin cream head that quickly dissipates. lots of malts, sugar and candy notes on the nose. nice and smooth on the palate, a little thinner than i was expecting but the chocolate is a nice full flavor. this has definitely done quite well with time.

Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;2002 vintage: Poured a clear dark ruby-brown color with no head. Aroma of smoke, chocolate, cigarette ash, and sweet roasted malt. The flavor was lighter than the aroma. Roasty and tart. A hint of soy and tartness on the finish.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;2002 bottle, courtesy of who else, but kp: Pours a transparent dark mahogany with a thin ring of tan head. Big smoky aroma has some roasted and chocolate maltiness and a hint of tart light fruit. Body starts with a touch of caramel malty sweetness turning more dry and ashy toward a bittersweet dark chocolate finish. Very drinkable and unique, almost like a smoked chocolate porter. This seems like it’s aged pretty well.
Red Brick Winter Brew (2003 and Earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Red Brick Brewing Company;Thanks for this one Wunderbier. I think the aging has probably helped this beer. A weird sweaty sock chocolate aroma. A dark brown/black appearance with a moderate head. The flavor is chocolate, honey, and oatmeal. A bit spicy and overcarbonated. Not bad.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;"I’m assuming this is the correct one. This bottle has definitely got some age on it, and the label is ""Summer Brew - Unfiltered Wheat Ale"". Pours a milky yellow with ridiculously massive billowing white head, at least 8 inches of head. Nose of banana, bubblegum, and lemon. But pretty weak all around. Flavor definitely has a graininess and metallic tinny finish. Pretty average actually."
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;A lightly hopped wheat ale, with some citrus in the nose, a light bit of fruit and spice on the palate. A hint of bubblegum, some cereal maltiness. Pretty light and refreshing.

Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Had on tap at the Red Brick Tavern in the Atlanta Airport. Pours an extremely cloudy orangeish-yellow with a frothy thick white head that leaves decent lacing. Requisite, sweet bubblegum aroma with a touch of banana. Flavor has the same bubblegum and banana thing going on with a bit of underlying coriander. Nothing really complex, but deent none the less - one of the best I have had from this brewer. Mouthfeel is pleasantly thick but fades just a tad near the end. Good refresher after traveling and fighting through the airport.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;this was not very good for a summer brew. kinda freaked me out that the label had instructions to make mimosas. weird...... mostly grainy, grassy, outdoorsy flavors and aromas. hints of lemon. not too much flavor and no palate. weird brew... and btw, anyone know if this is retired?? the 6er we got looked like it was 100 years old and i noticed there were 3 ratings from 2004 and then not since 2001
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Holy lord what have I stumbled across. A yellowish orange appearance with some sweaty sock and lemon aroma. The flavor is very odd and sour with some hay, lemons, and whatever funk that was left in the vats from the previous brew. A yeasty and slimy presence exist. The bottle recommends mixing it with 4oz of pineapple or grapefruit juice?? I can see why you would want to. Screw this stuff.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;THere is nothing all that great and all that bad about this beer. It is fairly light bodied and has a bit of funk in it, possibly due to the extreme old age of the bottles i found. I would have it again for the 4 dolla i payed for the sixer.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;This is not bad as much as I hate to admit that, as I really do not like the majority of ABC’s beers. This was a nice tangy summer outing. Lots of fresh fruit, balanced acidity, some spicy corriander and orange peel flavors as well. Very clean tasting.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;Large rocky white head with hazy yellow appearance. Aroma of lemon and yeast with a flavor to match. Crisp and refreshing. Nice body with a clean finish. This is better than I thought it would be.
Red Brick Summer Brew (2005 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Red Brick Brewing Company;They have a ton of this at greens in atlanta now. Cloudy orange pour with a thick, lasting eggshell white head. Wheat and yeast aromas along with a bit of malt when warmed. Nice hopping in the taste, with some citrus (orange), coriander and some peppery spice. I’m going to call it medium bodied, but it’s cutting it close. Nice finish, with some lingering hop bitterness. Nothing to really complain about, it’s pretty solid. Slight sourness keeps it out of the top ten. The best of the red bricks I’ve had yet. Way to go for the locals.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Draught at Bayerischer Donisl, Munich. Light hazy yellow coloured, medium sized white head that went away slowly, pleasant estery fruity nose. The taste is huge letdown, light yeasty, weak fruity and sourish wheaty with not so pleasant tart finish.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Used to drink this back when I would go to the Vortex. Don’t remember caring too much for it. Bland bready maltiness, not a realy clean feeling on the palate, I want to drink something else to get the taste out of my mouth. Finishes with a bit of citrus.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;I used to drink this stuff when I thought I was cool back in 1998. Cool label. Cooller bottle cap that looks like it was stolen from Vortex in L5P! I remember way back when even that this could be a little better than what it was.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Pours a golden color like a typical pilsner. Has a white head. Not much of an aroma or mouth feel. Same with the flavor tasted like a better brewed budwieser but still not good.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;thanks quiver. Poured a havy yellow with a explosive white gusher head. Dishwater and lemon in the aroma. Flavor was citrusy to malt sour with a clear finish..
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Not sure if I had a bad 6 pack or what.... Was super extreamly carbonated... Poured it into a pint glass... 90% of the glass became the foamy head. I was fairly excited about trying this beer. I would like to try it again, either from the tap or from a different store. I will rerate when I do
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;ABV listed as 5.9%. Pours light golden with a thin white head. Aroma is soapy, slighty funky. Taste is wet cardboard, medicinal, wiper fluid, not good. Closest brewery to my house, but something is wrong.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;a pretty good pilsener. pretty hoppy for a pilsener, and kind of malty. bitter on the finish and a pretty refreshing surprise.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Had this one out of the bottle at the halftime cafe. It was actually pretty good contrary to all the shit shag was talkin about ABC. It was an orange hinting on red color with a full malty aroma. I tasted some definite hotness in this, kinda like a red dog, but way better.
Atlanta Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsener (2008 and earlier);Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Red Brick Brewing Company;Nice fresh aroma. Avarage looking pour with average size and quality head. Nice flavor, but the hops flavor was much more American than Bohemian. Nice palate with a good bitter finish. I’d have it again.
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"""for a supposedly british style brewery, this one’s pretty stinkin hoppy. looks unassuming, but between the aroma and the taste, this is a highly enjoyable bitter, floral, grapefruity ipa. well done."""

Moyennement ronde en bouche avec un pétillement moyen et une texture légèrement résineuse et aux notes crémeuses. Goût léger-moyen amer de houblon citrique aux notes résineuses (présent en arrière-goût toute la gorgée) avec des notes fruitées (agrumes) lors de l’entrée en bouche auquel se rajoute un goût malté de caramel sucré légèrement rôti ainsi qu’un léger goût de pain grillé puis en finale, l’amertume de houblon se veut légèrement plus résineuse et herbeuse en plus d’être accompagné de traces de chocolat et de noix. Post-goût moyen-long et un peu sec, moyen-léger amer de houblon légèrement citrique, résineux et herbeux. (2006)
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Pours ruby red from bottle. Amazing aroma..big hops and. sugars. Aroma does this beers justice, flavir is mice but loses something in way if hops a sweet malts.
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);This is what I think of when I want a simple go-to beer, body, flavor, and simple lingering.
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Great aroma, excellent hop profile, lots of cascade: flavor is not as interesting, lightly sweet malts, light hops
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at the brewery in August 2009. Reviewed from notes. Pours a moderate amber color with an off white head and a bit of lacing. Nose brings forward some amber and caramel malt with a tiny bit of roasted character as well as some light citrus and floral hops. Taste brings a dry, doughy character along with moderate caramel sweetness. Slight citrus bitterness. Medium body with a bit of dryness. Drinks fairly well, but is somewhat bland. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 10-13-2010
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy amber with a moderate off-white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace. Mild aroma of malt and really not much else. No hops in the nose at all. The flavor is very malty with a bit of nuts. The malt morphs into a sweet stale malt flavor with some overripe orange. Mild-moderate bitterness at the finish. Not real crazy about this one.
Avery Redpoint Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Pours a cloudy like brown -reddish hue with light head. Aroma, I can’t smell anything. Taste a little watered down, slight hint of the alcohol flavor you get from Imperial IPA(s). Got this beer in a variety case and I have to say so far this is not a good showing for Avery, who makes a delicious I mean breathtaking IPA in the Avery dunga (something like that).

Avery 14er ESB;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);From Sep 2007 From my notes of July 30, 2007 at Old Chicago on S Colorado Blvd, Denver. It poured from 12oz bottle a clear medium gold with a small head of foam that shrinks quickly to just a ring around the glass. The smell had some hoppy notes as well as some malt. The taste is balanced to a Tee. The initial flavour was grassy but then some grain and the malt moved in almost immediately to make for some very good balance and smoothness. The finish is dry and crisp and there was a long and pleasing aftertaste. I liked it a lot.

Avery 14er ESB;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"""i think mine had some age on it, so the aroma and flavor were somewhat dull and a bit musty. the hops create some bitterness and little else, and nothing about it is fresh. not terrible, but not good, or anywhere near the top tier esbs. A bit of a disappointment."""
Avery 14er ESB;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bottle gift fromSJ. I enjoyed this simple brew. A little thin in the body, but I liked the blend of brown sugar, hop and bitterness.

Avery IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);A very drinkable IPA that brings the bitterness with basically all the fruit flavor bing more on the smell and not so much in the taste. It is dry but really smooth and easy to drink.

Avery IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Can from Drinks of the World Zürich. No date on can so impossible to see how fresh. Dry, bitter, resinous but lighter than I would have imagined. Nice but not really amazing
Avery IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);For the style, this really isn't that great of an IPA. Balanced off a bit...needs more hops or different malt/hop variety. Semi-clean feel...thinner maybe more like a West-Coast. Not getting much citrus in here. For Avery, I expected a little better. Bottle might have been old though, as I noticed this in a few of the 6-mixpack that I got from Winn-Dixie.
Avery IPA;Boulder, Colorado, United States;IPA;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Definite hops bite coming through but not a lot else going on. 75 characters can be waayyy too long sometimes. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Avery New World Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Could be one of the best medium-priced porters that I had that is sold in 6-packs. Actually bought a single of this to try after scouting it a bit. Was in the “clearance” section at Knightly Spirits/Metrowest in Orlando. I asked how old those bottles were, was told about 2 months or so, so for $1.50 I said I’d take my chances. Turned out to be a great experience. Nice hearty aroma of chocolate malts and coffee, with a slight bitterness from the hops. Good dark brown, near black appearance with dark mocha colored head. Smooth semi-creamy taste of chocolate, coffee (but overwhelmingly so like a robust porter). Loved the balance on this one. Can’t wait to buy a 6’er of this!
Avery New World Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"Dark brown/black color; Medium creamy body; Aroma of toasted malt, coffee, & hops; Flavor of roasted malt, hops, coffee, chocolate, and spice; Finish is bitter; Nicely balanced; Kinda like a black IPA - good."

Avery New World Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Bought this from Beer Mongers in Portland, OR 11 months ago. Kind of forgot about it. Dark, black coffee appearance. Small head with little to no lacing. Still fairly carbonated and it retained some of the dry hop aroma. Smells very nice! Lot’s of subdued caramel, maltiness with some cocoa bits in there. Taste is surprisingly dry hoppy still with some licorice and caramel malt sweetness. Pretty tasty. Nice balance with the carbonation. Nice light richness in the mouthfeel with some cool textural quality. Really decent beer I wish I had drank fresh!
Avery New World Porter;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Porter;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Coca cola brown, lasting tan head. Pronounced aroma.

Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Borderline Top 10 barleywine, but solid nonetheless. Has some hop to it....not quite as bitter and citrusy as a DIPA. For 9.2% (lower end of barleywines), would expect to be slightly smoother with less alcohol bite. Nice to try new samples in this style, but tough to beat a good Old Stock.
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"12-ounce can pours clear copper-amber with a tiny tan head and residual lacing. Aroma: brown sugar, almond butter. Flavor: caramel, caramelized sugar, brown bread, raisins, pine. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied. The bottle says this is an ""imperial IPA,"" but I think it's more like a barley wine, which is what it's listed as on this site."
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"One of the most beautiful foamy heads I've seen, tan and thick like marshmallows; stays for a while but after a few minutes it mostly disappears. Its high alcohol is upfront since first taste, but it does not overpower others. This is a very bitter beer, but drinkable. It's malty, hoppy, and obviously some pine resin and tropical fruits way back. Wet grass and alcohol once it warms a little. This is a very good beer, not red but caramel in color."

Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);"Sumptuous. Witty. Unforgiving. Tempting. Wicked. I pour my test beers NOT into snifters, but rather 24oz schupper mugs. I have always loved red IPAs. Those of you touting this as a barley wine, get a new hobby. I had a rough day at work. My wife tells me rhe kids are working tonight, let's have a great meal with great drinks. I respond, ""ok!"" We head to Whole Foods for, what else, dry-aged steaks and some premium beer. After the steaks and beets (yes, we love beets) are in the basket, it's BEER AISLE TIME!! Hmmmm, local beers, sour beers (yukk), i see a pink can with PIGS on the label. This is me!! But, at 12.99 a sixer, i tell my wife I'll go with the old stand-by, and quite a delicious beer, Sam Adams Cherry Wheat (i love cherry anything). My wife STOPS ME IN MY TRACKS. ""If you're going to overspend 9.99 on cherry wheat, you may as well get the pig cans for 12.99!! God, I love my wife!!! At home, my wife has her Chardonnay poured, now it's time for the pigs to squeal. Great pour. Nice deep red/orange. Aroma of deep tropical fruits. This, gentlemen, and ladies, is the epitome of red IPAs everywhere. Tongue-tickling carbonation. Deep piney flavors, but not like you are chewing on pine tree bark! Alcohol is warming, but subtle enough TO LURE YOU INTO A 24 OUNCER!!! This is a MUST TRY red IPA. Please do so and let us know."
Avery Hog Heaven;Boulder, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Can at home. Pours hazy medium amber with pillowy white head. Sharp hoppy aroma with rich malt background. Notes of caramel, toffee, grapefruit. Opens with strong malt profile, which balances well against the resin-y hop bitterness. Malt character is rich and somewhat toasty, with subtle dark, sweet fruit. Full body and luxurious mouthfeel. Very pleasing, warming finish with notes of citrus. All in all, quite excellent.
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Not. A bad beer for the style or price .

Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Oct 2018 - 12fl oz can picked up in Denver for $1 and consumed at home in Richmond watching sport, which is what beers like this were designed for. As 'Genesee', no ABV or date. NY's oldest brewery - Est 1878. Branding makes it look like a low-budget supermarket own-brand. Pours a very pale golden, totally clear, lightly sparkling, foamy off-white head leaves full lacing. Aroma is airy, touch of raspberry bubblegum (bizarrely), faint apple. Body is light, rounded with tingly to fizzy carbonation. Taste is metallic water, some salted crackers but mostly tangy metallic sodawater, crisp finish with some odd esters lingering. First impression was quite neutral. Then I hated it. Then over time I warmed to it a little. I guess it's not so bad, but slightly below average for a pale lager. (3-4-4-2-7=2.0)
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Consumed from can. Very light and watery with that corn vibe similar to the mass produced big brews. While lacking real flavor this would be good for a less filling all day backyard bbq kind of day.

Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Re-introduced to a old friend . I like to make my own choices not be lead by who has the most money for advertising . Genesee Cream Ale imo is as good if not better than ....Coors lite....Bud lite. And at half the price. New York,s Oldest Brewery Founded 1878....140 years in business..The success is in the numbers. On a hot day it hits the spot perfectly . I know this is a sin but I like mine with ice and a twist of lime. Con-grades keep up the good work.........Bear on Beer.
Genesee Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Pale gold with traces of a white head. Grainy nose with some stale donuts. The taste is pear core along with some green wood. There is a lightly soapu finish with some hints of spice. Not bad for a cheap macro style lager.

M: Light body with very high carbonation; finish is very dry. O: A super clean, crisp cream ale; not much more to say."
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);So easily drinkable with good enough fizzy feeling. Has corn sugar or syrup smell but not so big. It’s gentle. Taste good with a bit of lemon juice
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Clear pale golden with a light semisweet aroma. Smells of lager malt and light corn sugar. Smooth clean flavor that’s soft and Lagery crisp. Gently Lagery and pale and softly sweet.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Some cream corn and pepper on the nose. Medium gold color with a thin white head. Very sweet up front. Sweet corn with some biscuit notes. Bitterness is earthy with some pepper. Kolsch like. Finish is sweet with metallic notes. Average
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Light cracker malt aroma. Light cracker malt with a touch of hay and some dry bitterness in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel and medium-light body. Medium-length finish.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);For 66 cents a beer, I would think cheaper than Bud. This was one offer that I couldn't refuse. Saw this and wanted to try, then saw the price and HAD to try. Decent summer beer. Nothing special. Corn, water, and hops. I also thought this was going to be creamy, but was told that cream ales are actually a version of a Kolsch. The hop finish is nice. This is a light beer and refreshing. Worth the price, but besides that is pretty much forgetable.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A nice beer to have around when you just want a cheap,regular beer. Nothing fancy. Just smooth and easy drinking. Cheers.
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Another of those underage beers. In 1976 a six pack was $2. This beer is very smooth and reasonably enjoyable. A bit sweet and malty but still a sentimental favorite
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Largely tasteless, slight malt aroma, slight malt/alkaline finish, not much going on tbh, not as smooth or worthwhile as the ice version. Drinkable and cheap (24 oz can, NJ)
Genesee Cream Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Cream Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Nostalgia makes you do strange shit sometimes. Well, that and the $13 price tag on a 30-pack from Binny's (slow season... I'm broke!). Drank this for the first time back in like 1985 at an 8th grade party in someone's basement. I lived in Cleveland back then. Moved to Chicago in the mid-90s and hadn't paid it much mind... until it showed up in this part of the country a few years back. Today I said 'fuck it... it's cheap, I'm broke and thirsty' and gave it a go. Yep. Still cheap shitty beer. Even Miller Lite is a marked improvement. Goes down like water though so I'll finish the case. Plus, I hate wasting stuff.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Water and corn. A little hop at the end which saves this beer, otherwise would be a total bust. On the flatter side carb-wise which give is a smoother feel, but I'd rather have some fizz to it with a beer of this quality. Pretty much a pale lager. Grabbed in the variety pack trying to save a few bucks, but not even worth it.....rather drink water. Why do brewers continue to brew this stuff?
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From old tasting notes. Deep honey gold color with a small bubble carbonation and a large creamy white head. Decent ale-like malt nose with a hint of sour apples. Initially, a sweet ale-like flavor. Zesty midtaste comes across and leads to a bitter hop finish. Tart bittersweet finish.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Part of a flight at the brewery. It’s pretty much a good macro golden ale..
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Tap at Genesee Brewhouse. Almost nose nose. A bit of grain and fruit. Fruity, sweet flavor with some corn. Pale golden color. Not much happening. Drinkable I guess.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Poured from a bottle into pint glass Appearance - a golden straw color which formed a large head upon pouring which faded quickly Smell - Sweeter, with no detectable hop aroma Taste - A bit of a corn flavor with not mush hop spice. Sweeter then the traditional ""domestic"" brew. Mouthfeel - Mid range in thickness/viscosity, but with a good amount of carbonation for the style/ Overall - Nothing to outstanding, but decent for its price (picked in a variety 12 pack for $8). For the price probably better then the standard domestic of its class."
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a medium golden with a decent white head. Aroma of grains, corn, and dough. Taste of sweetness and malts. This light to medium bodied brew I snot bad.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 Horse Ale is a clear, sparkling, light golden ale with no head-- just a swirl of small bubbles. It has an aroma of sweet malt and corn. It’s medium light bodied with a starchy finish. It tastes sweet and corny. There’s a rubbery, sulfurous funk to it that identifies it as a Genny. There seems to be a slight nuttiness to it. It’s funky and sweet, but I could have more than one in the ice-cold stubby format.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Tastes like a Macro. Watered Down and Little Taste. Carbonated and sour aftertaste. Must face some tough choices to pick it. Below average.
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 ounce bottle. cool grenade style/sized bottle. Tastes a bit like Genny Cream but not as sweet. Body is a slightly sweet though. Wouldn’t rush out and buy again
Genesee 12 Horse Ale;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Bottle to pint. Looks fine; a transparent gold with white head and ample carbonation. Smells and tastes semi-sweet and doughy. Average on the palate. Better than I expected."
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Sweet and malty, some caramel notes. Too thin for the style, not much body. Nothing too complex, a mediocre beer.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From old tasting notes. Translucent medium dark brown color with a foamy tan head. Faint roasted malt nose reminiscent of baked beans. Ligh sweet roasted malt flavor upfront. Middle flattens out and tends to be slightly salty. Finish is toasted mal and light hops. A decent cheap Bock beer.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Aroma and flavor is malts, mild fruit and a relatively clean/mildly sweet finish. Comparing it to craft examples isn’t fair but it was pretty decent.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at the Taproom on 104. As others have said, it’s probably Genny’s best offering. Tastes like being home.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Light brown, whitish head. Some Carmel malts. Easy drinking, but noting special.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Still bordering on mass produced swill, but of the malty non-offensive kind. I’d take a free one but wouldn’t buy one. Same with any Gene.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Another very good beer from genesee.pours a nice red.good flavor.a little bready but not overpowering
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can. Clear golden amber color, thin white head. Aroma of light caramel. Taste is lightly metallic caramel.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);APPEARANCE- dark amber color with slightly beige head. NOSE- earthy & slightly bitter hop scent. FLAVOR- a bit malty with slightly bitter hop flavors. NOTES- May be one of Genesee’s best offerings, but does not stand up well to the bock beer style.
Genesee Bock Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Can shared poured cola brown sweet malt and caramel in the nose and the flavor not so good all the way around. I found nothing here drinking sweet caramel water.
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Best ice beer ever...smooth crisp and not heavy or bitter like other ice beers.....cheers!!!!

Light straw clear colour pour, light white head quickly disappates leaving thin white lacing. Sweet corn grain aroma. Light corn and malt taste, too sweet, very thin mouthfeel, slight fizzy carbonation, light drinking. Overall ok offering.
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"24 ounce can into lager glass, canned on 12/21/2017. Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. A bit of fruity corn aromas/flavors, but not overwhelming. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Nicely clean on lager flavors, not too fruity/yeasty. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 5.5%. Overall this is good iced pale adjunct lager. All around good robustness of pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink. Nicely clean and rich pils malt/grains, and mild earthy hop presence/balance. Not too overdone on adjuncts, and not overly sweet. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example."
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Very enjoyable beer, nice malt character and creaminess--not very high on the abv but for $1.07/24 oz (€1,30/liter, an almost absurd price by contemporary Estonian standards) it's an absolute steal at this price point. Would have again (24 oz can, Witty's)
Genesee Ice Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Light and thin, watery with a hint of malt, bread, and yeast. Not as bad as some macros.

Deep Amber colored body with a fluffy white head that receded quickly. The musky and grainy nose is light. Flavors of apple core and bread crust are present. The finish is sweet and woody.

Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a deep amber color with a two finger white foamy head. It leaves a decent level of lacing. The aroma had a sweet blend of caramel, toffee, a lighter sweet corn and at the end a roasted malt. The taste was sweet and roasted maltiness over coating an old earthy breadiness. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Overall, not a bad beer, could be construed as a decent budget amber lager. I probably have a few more of these.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Transfer from BA review on 11-7-12- Poured from bottle into pint glass Appearance – Pours a deep amber color with a two finger white head. The head has a great level of retention. Once it fades slowly over time it leaves a decent level of lacing. Smell – The aroma is a sweet blend of caramel, toffee, and a lighter sweet corn smell. Mixed with these aromas are some notes of a roasted malt. Taste – The taste starts out of roasted malt and a caramel sweetness. The roasted malt and some breadiness start out stronger and grow weaker as the taste advances. Unlike the roasted flavors, the sweet grows stronger as the taste advances. The caramel remains somewhat consistent in strength with a toffee flavor growing stronger more toward the middle of the taste. While this occurs, a corn malt flavor grows more and more in strength. In the end a very light earthy hop flavor comes to the tongue, with the sweet flavors this leaves a very odd taste on the tongue. Mouthfeel –The body of the beer is on the thin to average side with a moderate level of carbonation. Not bad for the style and it makes for a rather drinkable brew. Overall – A sweeter style affordable brew. Initially the flavors are quite nice, but the aftertaste is a little off for me (I can’t quite place it). OK, nothing more.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Genny Red is a clear, sparkling, amber lager with a turbulent, white film. It has a pretty fruity aroma with a bit of sweetness and a slight funk. It kind of smells like a hybrid of Genny Cream Ale and Genny Bock. It’s pretty light bodied and pretty smooth. The finish is reasonably clean. The flavor is mostly sweet, fruity malt and a barely detectable, wooden bitterness. There’s a little rubber flavor at the finish, but not much. This is just a swilling beer, really. It has more character than a standard macro, but nothing to offend a standard macro drinker. It really does seem like a mix of their Cream Ale and Bock.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Gorgeous perfect 5 pour. Dark red with a creamy beige head. Absolutely lovely. That’s where the fun stops. Sweet roasted corn aroma is ok. I’d be willing to bet this is Genesee beer or cream ale with coloring added. There just isn’t anything in the flavor to say it’s something different than that. Paid $6.49 for a 12 pack of bottles (Heritage collection). Looks better than it is.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Copper hue with small off white head. Nose of biscuit, cereal, and corn. Taste follows in order with addition of light caramel. Mild bitterness from grass. Light carbonation leads to a silken but thin body.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From the files: toss up whether this or the Cream Ale were the most foul of the Genny line. Red was reddish, maltish, a fine laxative with a minimal amount of alcohol
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours mahogany with a thin off white head. Smells of sweet malt, some caramel, some spicy hints. Tastes sweet and earthy with some tea hints on the finish.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Amber in color with a white head. Light, slightly sweet aroma. Taste is same, with caramel components. Not bad for robot produced industrial beer.
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz can-pours a white head and gold with orange color. Aroma is medium/light malt, cream ale. Taste is medium/light malt, cream ale, faint hops. OK/mild carbonation. 3.0 For $11 for 30pk could be 3.2, therefore 3.1
Genny Red;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);College beer that fits the workingman’s budget. It’s a great value, but it’s far too sweet for me now. It’s a fridge filler for sure. I’ll pick the Cream Ale first.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From old tasting notes. Amber red color. Small beige head. Slight toasted malt nose. Tasty bittersweet malt palate upfront. Bitter hop finish is overshadowed by excessive carbonation. Long dry aftertaste.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Had this back in college a couple time. Sweet reddish brown lager. Some very slight roasted flavors. A little thin. Pretty drinkable. Serving: Bottle

Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours copper with a thin tan head.

Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Pours brown with amber hue. Head id moderate. Smells of rich roasted malt, nuts, and caramel. Tastes just a malty, with some notes of honey, roasted malt, some nuttiness, and slight hoppiness. Pretty good, but slightly thin body. Aftertaste is pretty hoppy, but a nice malty sweetness.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz bottle.

Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Pours a brown body with ruby hues and n off white head. Sweet malty simple with a light hop bitterness to boot. eh.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Very dark lager. Drank this because A friend of mines name is Michael Shea. Caramel flavor, very sweet. Pleasant but nothing special
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz - No head, no fizz, overly sweet. A value brew to be sure, and it is rated as such.
Michael Sheas Irish Amber;Rochester, New York, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Crimson pour with a light tan head. This is backed by a light hop flavor and a mild bitterness. Bottle was given to me from my next door neighbor. Not bad.

Well, this beer proves that theory to be seriously lacking. Weak stout does not equal black and tan."
Michael Sheas Black & Tan;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz - If I’m reaching for a stout this would not be it. Too sweet and no spine. It’s still a standout among macros.
Michael Sheas Black & Tan;Rochester, New York, United States;Stout;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a medium brown. Light chocolate and a little coffee/caramel aroma. The flavor was rich and sweet. It is an average black and tan.

Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A lager that drinks like an ale. Do you like Bass? This is Bass, only less expensive... and more difficult to find.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);not to bad of a brew i found it alil too sweet for my like but not to bad at all i might try another
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I have not had one of these in a while since it is no longer available in my area. However, I do remember this being one great beer for those hot summer days.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A nice body on this Blonde. Very drinkable. Looking back 11 years ago I did not know much about beer then.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Interesting yeasty, dust aroma with a rare solvent wisp -- heck I just got something reminescent of wormwood. Very drinkable, medium low carbonation but still bright and flavorful.
Michael Sheas Blonde Lager;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A decent brew. I thought it was much too sweet. It was almost like a honey brew. Anyway...fairly good...but needs more hop bitterness or something imho.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From memory. My fraternity’s go-to beer for big parties. Yellow corn nightmare, cheapest beer money could buy.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"(bottle - 40 oz) Found this in the old rating book. Couldn’t believe that I forgot to rate it, but then I read what I wrote and remembered why. Straw yellow pour with a fizzy white head. Standard beer aroma; some hops and grassy notes. Flavor is pretty much beer. Nothing special one way or the other. Bitter and grassy on the finish."
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This really aint terrible. Dont know why some are knocking it. Enjoy a below par ny brew.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"I broke this out this evening lest I have more Imperial Stout ratings than Pale Lager ratings, only to find out its a Blonde Ale, oops it’s already open guess who’s going to buy a single of Chang tomorrow. Pours very clear, and (you guessed it) GOLDEN! There aren’t a lot of fizzy bubbles in this one but there is a really big attractive head, which is something I didn’t really expect. I’m really trying here to pull anything but adjuncts out of the aroma here but my olfactory fails me to do so. It’s not a stinky alcohol ridden corniness of a malt liquor, but kind of like a castrated version of that ol’ fashion malt liquor aroma, corny... kind of sweet... but also boring. The flavor is better than the aroma, it really honestly is, there is an honest snappy hoppiness and not an overbearing flavor of corn or alcohol. This is way drier than it smells, but it’s not without some grainy sweetness, oh and speaking of graininess there is some of that ol’ raw grain character here as well. The palate could be about as watery and boring as it gets, maybe I’d prefer that Golden Anniversary Ice for a more ""full"" mouthfeel. Seriously, I don’t hate this beer, I would pick this above so many other pale lagers. It’s just so damned inoffensive, so boldly flavorless, & so void of character that I feel I must rate it as it is. My sincerest apologies go out to my wife for cracking this so soon. Honey, I just couldn’t keep my hands off this one for another 46 years... guess we’ll have to celebrate our 50th with good beer."
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This is way better than expected. The flavor was smooth and delicious. Awesome for $6.00 at wal-mart in NY.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 pack purchased for a soft 7 bones. Surprisingly not bad at all. Pours a clear body, aroma and taste are bothb light but somewhat refreshing, not offensive at all.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Picked up a 12 pack at walmart outside Poughkeepsie for 6 bucks. Hell of a deal. Beers not bad either. Reminds me of saporo with slight berry notes.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"It’s better than Coors Light! At least this beer has that going for it. And if given the choice, I’d take this over Coors Light, or Bud Light or just about any of the other products from the big three brewers. But with that being said, this is not a very good beer at all. It’s one that I would picture a frat of college guys drinking several cases of after a football game on a Saturday afternoon &#40especially since it’s only $12 a case!&#41. The beer pours a light yellow color with a big, fluffy and bubbly white head. There was only a very minimal amount of lacing left around the glass, but the head actually stuck around for a little while. The nose is of straw, hay, slight hops and stale bubble gum. The body is extremely light, but somehow smooth and slightly drinkable. The flavors are pretty nonexistent though , with a doughy feel and only slight hints of grassy hops, hay and lightly carbonated water. The finish is a little sour, with more doughy tones, along with some light fruit and light hops. The best attribute about this beer is the value. It’s not a bad tasting brew, and for only $12 a case; if you’re looking to party and get slightly tipsy, this may be the candidate for you. Okay, it doesn’t taste that great."
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Picked this up at the local store and was surprised to see a Great American Beer Festival medal so I was kinda excited to try it. Upon trying it, my enthusiasm has faded. Pours a very clear, pale yellow color with a filmy white head and a LOT of carbonation. Aroma is light grainy, lots of corn, very sweet apple note overall. Flavor has an early corny note that lingers, mild grainy, sweet apple and overall just sweet at the end. Low body, thin texture, lots of carbonation in your mouth. Not a good brew, overly sweet and has a slight harsh corn taste to it that makes you squint after each sip with frustration. Blah.
Kochs Golden Anniversary Beer;Rochester, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours gold with a white head. Smells of creamed corn and apples. Tastes sweet and skunky with some stray peppery splashes.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Received in Heritage Collection from late fall. Probably leftover from summer, but ""value"" at $8/12-pack. The variety of beers were pretty weak. This included, although this could be the best of the 3. Pretty much a spiced pale lager....watery, corn, but not too rusty. I wouldn't get again, and would rather have actually had during summer vs. later fall/winter. But, it has been hot....and this has been, well....refreshing."
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Beer has a golden yellow color with a small head. It has a light malt aroma with some wheat. Taste is malty with some grain. Light hint of sweetness. Light beer that is an easy drinker.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Thanks to “cheap” for this brew. I always believed that this is probably one of the most underrated breweries in the country. Hey make good tasting domestic brew at better than your average price for them. I didn’t know this was a re- release, but a good clean, crisp beer. Must drink ice cold. I do like these stubby bottles.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 oz stubbie from Heritage Collection. Pours a golden color with a decent head that fades to bits of lacing. Aroma of malt sweetness and grain. Very faint hint of hops. Taste of malt sweetness and grain with a bit of citrus way in the background. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. Light body, crisp and a bit refreshing. Easy drinker that goes down easy. best when served cold on a Summer day.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I actually purchased a case of Genesee Summer Brew in the late 90’s and thought it was decent enought to be a yearly seasonal. Genesee became High Falls and this recipe went into the archives. Same fate that fell onto the two beers in the Heritage Pack. Poured contents of the stubble into an old school Schlitz goblet. I fared better than most raters with a thin head throughout sample of this clear golden pale lager. Slight aroma, light on bitterness, some grain and lemon in aftertaste. Hanging in the backyard with an iced cold Summer Brew it’s hard not to like it.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Pours a pale gold, with a large white head that dissipates quickly. Delivers what it promises, ""lager with a hint of sweetness"". Not as watery as the Fyfe & Drum I just tried, rather this has a creamy mouthfeel - a quality that seems the opposite of what one would look for in a summertime beer. Not very flavorful, but nothing offensive, either."
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Ahh... Now I have tasted the trifecta of the Genesee heritage pack. I present to you the summer brew, in all it’s glory. Pours a clear golden with a head that’s gone instantly. Aroma consists of honey, sweet corn, adjuncts. I have to say, the taste of the first two brews (Fyfe + Drum, 12 Horse) didn’t really exhibit that Genny funk that I have grown use to. This one brings it all home. This brew is loaded with adjuncts, heavy metals, unfiltered water and that good old Rochester, NY shitty quality that some people just can’t get enough of. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people. This is basically regular Genesee beer with a touch of honey to make it even sweeter. No hops present. Is there even any malt in here? I suppose there has to be, although I couldnt pick it out if you held a gun to my head. This beer is bad on so many levels, it’s almost laughably good. So fuck it, I’m giving it a homer score.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);OK, I didn’t just mow the lawn. I pay my kids to do that. But I did clean the deck, wash and wax the car and do some mulching. Then this beer tasted very refreshing. Mild easy to drink Genny with a little lemon? Seemed ok and did the job.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12oz stubby bottle into a pint glass. Part of the heritage pack. Pours a clear dark yellow with a one finger creamy head. Tons of carbonation and good head retention for a light lager. Smells of sweet corn along with a little bit of bread. Really nothing in the way of hops. The flavor is sweet overall with some corn and cereal grain up front followed by a nice toasted caramel. Bitterness is very light with no hop flavor detectable. Finishes with a slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall I was pretty impressed by this beer. It is slightly reminiscent of Red Stripe but quite a bit cheaper. Very refreshing and plenty of flavor packed into this one. Wish I could buy it on its own.
Genesee Summer Brew;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Ron gave me a bottle of this re-release. I found it enjoyable. But then I just finished a long shift of volunteering at RIT. Fruity nose. Clear and pale. Body bland but clean, with a bit of grainy heft behind it. No off tastes. Really not bad.

Samuel Smiths India Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Samuel Smith;Beautiful lasting foam and a lovely aroma that first makes me think peaches, but on closer attempts to form me a real impression also offers a little caramel and a unique aroma hop that sets expectations high. The taste is barely as hoped as expected and it gives way to a slightly sweet malted taste of caramel and crispy rye biscuits, while the hops are nicely balanced with citrus, peach and maybe I'm completely wrong, but isn't there a little discreet anise towards the end as well? All in all, a very tasty and quite typical IPA which I think is very authentic to the history of the beer type. It is just such a lovely IPA that sets a fine point for a busy work week and which is exciting to enjoy right up until the bottom.

Samuel Smiths Organic / Old Brewery Pale Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Samuel Smith;550ml bottle. Pretty pour of burnt caramel with thick tan head swirling to the meniscus. Aroma is fresh with a faint skunky hop character, roasted malt and hints of dried fruits like plum and figs. First sip delivers more upfront bitterness than I was expecting, but not in a bad way. Good malt and hop balance here with a moderate dry finish. Very little sweetness can be detected past the fruit notes in the nose. Some woody and earthen characteristics, with lots of good quality barley freshness shining through. I've said before that this is not among my favorite styles of beer, and this remains true. However, it's a well crafted recipe and I can't fault Sam Smith's for their commitment to solid quality beer. Probably wouldn't drink again unless my choices were greatly limited, but for what it is, this is refreshing and tasty. Enjoy with smoked meat or a fine gouda cheese.

Samuel Smiths Organic Best Ale / Organically Produced Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Samuel Smith;From Sep 2007 Purchased at Bi-Rite in Casper for US$3.29 It pours from 550ml bottle a clear gold with a nice thick head of foam that shrinks *very* slowly and ends up as a fine solid layer with good lacing.

The taste has a very good malt flavour up front with some caramel, some bread, a touch of fruit, and some roasted malt.The hops throw in some good citrus notes that help balance the malt and the end result is a very nice, flavourful and very drinkable Pale Ale.

Samuel Smiths Pure Brewed Organic Lager;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Samuel Smith;Tasted from bottle into sampler glass at 2019 Centennial Fest, it poured a clear golden colour with sudsy white foam, lasting with lace. Crisp and clean, grainy, grassy, definite minerality in mouthfeel (gypsum?), earthy, herbal, floral, faintest black pepper spice. Medium body and fairly dry finish, spritzy and refreshing, but not quite as light and bone dry as a German lager, there's still somehow recognizable bready English-style body and mouthfeel. Best of both worlds.

Hazy light straw pour with evaporating fizzy white foam head. Pretty carbonation, sweet and floral hop aroma with notes of lemon zest. First taste is remarkably crisp and deep tasting. An excellent composition for a pale lager. This beer does almost everything better than any macro pale lager you can name. Really exceptional balance between the organic malt and hops character.

Samuel Smiths Winter Welcome Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Samuel Smith;"Appearance and aroma weigh this beer down a bit, otherwise is slightly above average. For the style though, average at best. Shocking b/c this is the first beer that didn't quite work for me from Samuel Smith. Flavor is decent, balanced ok. Maybe a tad too sweet with the spices but hop finish cuts it down. More like a spiced ESB versus an ""English Strong Ale"" as listed here. Aroma is subpar, not much with the appearance (a light semi-cloudy brown). On clearance for a buck, so aroma and flavor could be not so fresh. Not really eager to try this again, but worth the dollar for the experience and review."

Flying Fish Abbey Dubbel;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Dubbel;Flying Fish Brewing Company;First sample from Flying Dog. A decent beer, but didn't seem quite like a full representation of a Abbey Dubbel. More like a maibock or regular dobblebock....or something similar to a German beer. Reminded me of Spaten's Optimator actually. Not really feeling the Belgian yeast or fruitiness of an abbey. Still, a good brew with nice caramel malt and hop balance. Ok quality....for the price per 6-pack (about $7.49) and the strength (7.3%), I will probably get a 6 instead of single sample to get a better idea. Curious to try some different styles now from this brewer, as they are starting to be distributed here.
Flying Fish Abbey Dubbel;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Dubbel;Flying Fish Brewing Company;07-May-14 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with slob, thanks Bert!) This beer pours a hazy, brown body with less than half an inch of tan head that settles to a thin rim. Aromas of toasty bread crust, brown sugar, molasses, and dried fruit. Flavors are similar, with a prominent flavors of toasted bread and caramel, plus brown sugar, and dark, dried fruit. The beer is medium-full in weight, medium in carbonation, and though sweet, there's enough toasty character lending some dryness in the finish. Overall, this Dubbel isn't particularly Belgian in character, but it's tasty and enjoyable nonetheless.
Flying Fish Abbey Dubbel;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Dubbel;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Just about the perfect Abbey for my money. Super smooth, no discernable bitterness.
Flying Fish Abbey Dubbel;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Dubbel;Flying Fish Brewing Company;Dark fruits with hops that give a unique Belgian flavor. Low carbonation. Smooth and sweet.

PALATE: interesting combination of crisp and acidic upfront, with a lingering creamy dryness, a bit thin for a belgian abbey ale but overall it is medium bodied OVERALL: a pretty good beer, a little underwhelming at first but the more I sip on it, the better it gets. Not overly robust or overly flavorful, but well balanced. Might be a bit sweet-n-sour for some. Enjoyable ... plus it has 7.2% alcohol.

Flying Fish ESB Amber Ale;Somerdale, New Jersey, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flying Fish Brewing Company;"Found this to be something in between an ESB and an Amber. Lacking the ""bitter"" in the ESB...so basically mild on the hops. Clean mouthfeel with fresh hop finish, but the balance is leaning towards the malts (mainly caramel). Light to medium brown-orangish appearance. Making my rounds of sampling Flying Fish....so I'd say this is about average. So far, their Abbey Dubbel is the one that I return to. May get this again, but wouldn't really miss it if I didn't."

Nutfield Auburn Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Nutfield Brewing Company;Bottle purchased from Yankee Spirits in Sturbridge, Mass. Aroma is mildly metallic with a bitch of peppery hops, but quite mild. Interestingly, smelling the bottle after immediately opening it, I get lots of maple sugar in the aroma. I do not know if this was primed with some sort of maple sugar or not, but it does not to be inherent after the beer is poured. Transparent reddish copper color with a large frothy vanilla colored head. Wow, this is extremely carbonated! More carbonated than a brand new soda. Let me try to find some flavors after this inital shock...some roasted caramel notes are pleasant with some metallic flavors. The overcarbonation really fucks this beer up. Big time.

Nutfield Auburn Ale;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Nutfield Brewing Company;This offering from Nutfield pours a reddish-brown that leaves a thin lace in the glass that disappears quickly. The aroma is faint, it has a caramel, nutty, floural hop aroma. As I taste this brew, It has a creamy mouthfeel, with a slightly watered vinous feel on the palate. Again I have to stress the taste is bland, not much going on, the hoppiness I expect is lacking. In the finish is stays with that soft caramel malty sweetness, overall not exciting could have more complexity in the body, as well as there is something about the nutfield brews that give them all the same basic character/finish not a good thing.

Nutfield Black 47 Stout;Derry, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Dry;Nutfield Brewing Company;I found a bottle for this in an unnumbered box in my cellar recently and lets just say curiosity got the best of me tonight.

A little rusty at first and bitter (not in the best way), but at the end the hops settles in and has a decent bitter-sweet flavor mixed in with the caramel malts. Might also be a little honey in there too. Color is about medium, not dark brown like some other brown ales. I may prefer nut browns over this though, or a Dutch Brown. There are better ones out there in this style.

Sly roaming speckled lace. The aroma had the Fuggles sweet to estery floral/herbal qualities coming across the malts somewhat in an acceptable ""soapy"" fashion. Biscuit sweet malts plead their case for the balance. The flavor blends all of the previously aromas together mostly sweet with that smooth soapiness coming into flow in the aftertaste and finish. The palate was almost medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine. Pretty smooth all around. Overall, as an ESB, it works, I get it and don’t mind it."

BridgePort Black Strap Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;BridgePort Brewing;Originally reviewed: 8/13/09. Poured into my pint glass, this beer is a shade lighter than deep black. There’s a thin tan head on top that disappears quickly, but it leaves plenty of sticky lacing. Smells of roasted nuts and malts, raisins, and hints of cocoa. The mouth is creamy, but a tad thin for the style. The creaminess carries over to the flavor as well. Big creamy chocolate goodness all over this beer. Finishes roasted and slightly nutty. This is a great standard stout that I will reach for quite often.

BridgePort Black Strap Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Dry;BridgePort Brewing;Thanks to Eric for the bottle.. this one was surprisingly hard to track down! Poured clear (as far as I could tell) deep brown with a short-lived cap of beige head. The aroma picked up a huge dose of the molasses as well as soy sauce, showing a bit of age and light oxidation.. deep and dark.. actually struck me as something of a SATB light. The flavor found dry-roasted molasses, soy, and maple sweetness at the core.. faint vanilla and lactic sourness surrounded.. more of the milky notes and molasses on the finish. Medium-bodied and dry on the palate with a bit of surprising sour character.. not your typical dry stout, and it seemed a little old.. I’d love to try it again.

The aroma is mild with wheat and hints of citrus. The taste is thin, raw, a fully of wheat flavors and hints of coriander. It does leave a lingering crisp wheat flavor on the tongue.

Boulevard Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Originally rated on 9/18/08. No. 6 out of the sampler 12 pack was a pretty good stout.

Boulevard Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Black, with a dense, tan head. Looks like nitro. Too excites to care about the aroma it tastes just like Guinness. If that’s what they were trying to do, they did one better because this one’s made right here in the greatest United States of America. The finish is a little roastier. Yuup!
Boulevard Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);October 7, 2013 - on tap at Boulevard airport location. Dark brown pour with nice long lasting head. Aroma and taste that reminded me of guinness, but a bit more coffee flavor. Smooth and creamy palate, but a touch thin.
Boulevard Dry Stout;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Recent I visit city of Kansas with much barbeque and jazz. I visit local Boulevards brew factory for tour, but they tell me is sold out. After much dissapoint, I join a grp of festive ppl for taste experience and nice lady pour me many drink fresh from factory. I like this dry stout, it look like sweet choco drink and taste of dark spl brew similar to guinness or other delicious brew.

Pretty average, but still good.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);One of my favorite beers. I wish they would of kept making this beer. Just had a unique flavor to it. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);I have been looking for this beer for over three years. I remembered having it years ago, and really wanted to re-visit after moving to Kansas City. Needless to say, this was not an easy beer to find, but eventually I found someone with a bottle laying around, so here it goes. Keep in mind that this beer is quite old, likely over 7 years. Pour is hazed orange copper amber with a one inch off white head that falls pretty quick with decent lacing. Looks nice. Aroma is toasty malt initially, followed by a bright citrus cardboard. The initial aroma was nice, actually. The oxidized aroma passes quickly, and benign crystal malt is left behind. Taste is toasty crystal malt, some light sugar sweetness, and only a whisper of cardboard in the finish. This actually tastes in better shape than some English milds I have had in the bottle. The finish gets a bit dirty, and detracts some. Palate is lightly carbonated, with a nice chewy medium body. Despite the really low abv, this didn’t taste watery in the least, and even despite the years, had some nice character.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours hazy light brown with a thin white head. Aroma is light malt, sour apple, and tea. Flavor is light and fruitty. Would have been a decent session beer and I am sure it would have been better when fresh.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);One of the first bitters I ever tried...wouldn’t try it again. First...not worth the money for the ABV. Second, the flavor was weak and so was the aroma. It reminded me more of a light american lager than anything else.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Weak alcohol and taste wise. A hint of citrus. A refreshing beer after to wet the whistle
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);So-so flavor. This is a beer that Boulevard made that could be sold in Kansas grocery stores due to its low alcohol content, and it looks better than it tastes. Not very flavorful, but still better than the macrobrews that you’d get at a supermarket. I don’t know if they even make it anymore.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bronze color with a off white head. Light malt and citric hops aromas. Light simple malt flavors with a touch of hopsack. A typical ale.
Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Light and has a citrus taste. Other than that it is very light. Still has that typical yeast taste of Boulevard.

Boulevard Tenpenny Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Nice citrus aroma, light body thin and watery, no bitterness I can tell, very weak.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Pour was light brown, off white head. Aroma of sweet malt, caramel, roasted malt, spice. Taste was mild bittersweet, malty, caramel, earthy.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Faithful interpretation of an underwhelming style. Caramel, toast, nuts, and fresh wheat bread lead to a mild floral bitterness on the back end and a dry, doughy fade. Inoffensive, but not terribly interesting. A good background beer, I guess, when you don't give a shit what you're drinking as long as it isn't utter swill. Gorgeous red-brown color, though.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Smell is like a scotch ale. Color is brown with a red tint. Taste is Amber, Woody, hops, some bitterness and refreshing clean finish. Not normally what I go for but like it.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Caramel malt aroma with notes of roasted malt, earthy hops and toasted malt. Pours a lovely shade of dark red with one finger of reddish-white head that has excellent retention but no lacing. Starts with nice caramel and toasted malt flavors. Finishes with roasted malt and bitter earthy hop flavors. Pretty nice Irish red.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12floz bottle, BBD: 07.16.2018, $7/six-pack, pint glass. A fine looking red ale, where there's a one finger head on the pour and good retention. Smells of bready caramel goodness, and taste is very toast like (a touch of roasted malt with a hint of butter noted). There is an astringency that holds this beer rating back, which at one time I considered this to be good beer in general and not just to the style. It's still pretty good for the style as it accomplishes much o what is desired, but the lingering tinny taste is bothersome. My prior fondness for this beer may be biasing my score a bit high.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Good smooth Irish ale. 30 IBU makes it a tiny bit more bitter than some ales. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);From Jun2007 Purchased at Liquor Shed in Casper This ours from 12oz bottle(best by May 1 2007) a nice clear amber with a smallish head of foam that shrinks pretty quickly to some spotting near the edge of the glass with some lacing. The smell has some sweet and roasted malt to it and it's nice. The taste isn't as sweet as the nose would indicate and that's fine by me. This has a good roastiness to it with some sweet notes and some fruity hop goodness there as well that shows up mostly in the finish. Nice long lasting aftertaste that is very yummy. A very smooth yet tasty drinker...I've had this many times before and I was surprised to find that I hadn't reviewed it yet. I think this is a top notch example of the style and I *believe*, my favourite to date. Very well done, Boulevard!
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Backlog in tree 12 oz bottle pours out a brown color with a little bit of red highlights topped with a sand head. Nose is nice bread malt a little bit of roast nut and earthy hops. Taste is more of the ligh hops and the nice Woody notes.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Originally rated on 2/12/09. Amber- copper body, thin head, with no lace. Aroma of toffe and caramel malts, decent mouthfeel. Flavor of sweet slightly toasted malts with a few hops peeking through, smooth with a decent balance. Overall a pretty good Irish Ale.
Boulevard Irish Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Short stubby bottle like the one pictured but the label is different, it says red ale prominently. Big malty aroma that follows a milder malty nose. First taste is aged ale like. Decent co2, but yes this is quite like an irish ale of the old country, I think. Difficult, does not hide its abv attribute, its there, get used to it. Reddish? Not too sure, its more like orange brown yellow, 314. Whew. Becomes a little difficult in the end, but it is beer.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);9/17/19 - Maumelle, Ar - Lake Liquor - 12 oz bottle. Bright orange appearance with a light off-white head. Sweet, malty aroma with some cotton candy sugary notes. The flavor has some of the same sweet accents with a little bit of nuttiness in there as well to round it out nicely. No fading to vegetable -like drabness in this like some Marzens tend to do . One of the better domestic Oktoberfests that I have had in a while.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);My favorite Oktoberfest beer. Smooth and satisfying. It is only available for a limited time so pick up a 6 and try it.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);B. Pours a clear Amber color with white head. Aroma is fruity with smoked berry character. Highly drinkable
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);From May 2008 I had a bottle of this at Old Chicago last night. Nice clear amber red pour with a very small head of foam that disappeared completely within a couple of minutes. The nose had a nice strongish bready and caramel malt smell with a noticeable fruity note and just a bit of hoppiness hiding in the background. I really liked taking whiffs of this one! Nice caramel and bready malt flavour with some fruitiness and a fairly dry finish thanks to a small but, it is there, hop presence. Wow. The more I drank, the more I wanted to drink...extremely drinkable for me(mouthfeel was nice and not a bit watery) and very satisfying. I just wish I could buy some sixers around town. :^(
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours amber with minimal head. Aroma is fruity with smoked berry character. Flavor is crisp and smooth. Highly drinkable.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Smells rich and malty with spicy hops. See through amber color with a pale white head. Sweet but not overdone with a crisp and earthy hop bite. This is a good representation of the style.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours a light, clear copper color with white head. Bready malty aroma. Moderately sweet, bready, malty, slightly earthy. A nice fest bier. Notes: Bottle from Cosentinos, Oct '17
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Solid marzen, malty but brisk, offering up deep caramel and nutty flavors while keeping mild apple esters and a moderate noble hop bite on the back end. Never quite reaches the malt depths you want it to, but it also refrains from growing cloy, and the floral hoppiness makes for a bright, clean finish. Decent festbier nose, and the pour is a lovely orange-red with a slight head and modest lace. Sparkly texture with a hint of oily clinginess. Not bad.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Draft @ Boulevard Brewpub (KC Airport) - Pours deep orange brown, clear. I'm getting mild caramel notes, some bitter dryness. Meh.
Boulevard Bob's '47 Oktoberfest;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Stylistically, it was just a little sweet, but this is one of the better Oktoberfests I have ever had and I love the American interpretation of the style. It had a rich maltiness but was well balanced by the hops.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle pour into shaker pint glass from Total Wine & More, Danvers. Appearance is lightly hazy (lots of fine particulates in suspension) red-dark amber with trace sparkle, finger-width creamy beige head with excellent retention and decent soapy lacing. Aroma is pumpernickel bread. Taste follows aroma but less intense. Mouthfeel is medium side of light-to-medium bodied with smooth, creamy texture, average-to-lively carbonation and dry, fairly crisp finish as taste. Overall, pretty much a one-trick pony. No complexity but it is pretty comforting.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours clear, dark copper with a three finger, beige head. Aroma is molasses, hops and light spice. Taste is light brown sugar, moving to light nutmeg and hops. Finish is hops and light nutmeg.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12 oz bottle.

Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle purchased at Hy-Vee. Pour was dark amber, foamy off white head. Aroma of caramel, convoluted spices. Taste was mild sweet, malt, caramel, toffee, fruit zest, nut.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);"It's weird that as I review this I have been wanting to try this for years. Actually found a single of it one time but it was too much a hassle to price check it. Alas. A few years later and I found a single of it; I'm glad I didn't fully commit to a 12 pack of it. Not much to say that hasn't already been said. It has a piney scent. A flat citrus taste. It has a nice lace but other than that it's all booze. And that's ok. If your at a party and your choices are Natural Light or this choose wisely. In my opinion most of the Christmas beers miss the point. They always seem to please too many people. Or are too ironic. I feel like with this one it either needs to have more hops or be more closely related to an ale. It seems closer to a pale ale with a cloying after taste. I do like the bottle design if that can be the only positive."
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Pours orange with a beige head, aroma of orange toffee and caramel, flavor orange and toffee, caramel notes, pretty alcoholic with medium body
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);12 ounce bottle from the remainder shelf at Liberty Beer in Pittsburgh. Just pretty much average in all categories. Not very remarkable.
Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);bottle. Poured opaque reddish amber with a beige head. Fruity tart aroma.

Boulevard Nutcracker Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boulevard Brewing Company (Duvel-Moortgat);Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a cloudy orange-caramel color with an enormous fluffy orange-tan head that lingered and left decent lacing. The aroma was malty with a hint of baking spices. The flavor was very bitter and astringent with notes of malt and dry spices. Long finish. Medium body. Not good.

Oily mouthfeel - a touch sticky.
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;A little citrus and grain. However, lacking a little as most of the Stone beers. Not much to it.
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;Stone City hefeweizen is on a par with the great wheat beers and was quite a good local beer. Very enjoyable to drink.
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;A very nice thirst-quenching hefe. Good clove-banana aroma. Especially good on tap fresh at the brewery
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;How to describe it . . . flavorful, yet gritty. Unfiltered wheat beer or no, it's got a vague sandy consistency, but it's extremely refreshing and, if you're in Eastern Iowa, it's a darn good local brew that's reasonably readily available. Nice citrusy hints, decent body--not bad at all.
Stone City Hefeweizen;Solon, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Stone City Brewing;I love this kind of beer. It seems to be the only thing apart from a Corona type beer that I can handle.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;I really liked this particular version of an IPA. Very unique flavor, for an ipa that is. Used to be one of my favorites
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;You can't get this anymore, but a friend of mine had some left over from last year. I can't say that age improved the brew. Tasted about the same as I remember it tasting when it was a staple beer of mine. I can't believe I used to think this was good. It's bland and boring. I hate to disparage the hometown team, but guys, this was not a hit!
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Not that impressed. As usual, Stone City creates a fairly sub-standard beer for the locals. The ale is weak and has plenty of yeast for those who like bottled ales.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Clear bronze color with a thin coating of white, semi-lacing head. Aroma of sour malt and bittering hops. Body is much the same, crisp, but bland and uninteresting. Reminds me somewhat of Sam Adams Lager.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Pour produced a thick, white & frothy head. Deep amber color. Peculiar aroma (airplane glue?). Flavor was bitter at first, then the Kent Goldings were apparent. Decent beer, hard to get past the aroma.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;"I am open to the possibily I had a BAD BOTTLE but I don't have enough experience with ales to be sure. I thought it was awful and poured it. Appearance was disgusting; aroma, flavor and mouthfeel not much better. I promise to re-rate if I can find more."
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;The color of pennies glistening in a subtle light, with a thick and foamy head that diminishes. The hops aroma entices the senses, while the thick, full mouth produces a sense of heaviness. The fruity, hops taste compares well to Alpha King.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Hazy amber color with a smallish light tan colored head. Aroma is quite fruity sweet/sour and floral. Flavor much better than the aroma. Mild caramel malt flavor with a touch of sourness. Mild hops flavor. A bit thin in mouthfeel. Finish is rather nondiscript.
Stone City Iowa Pale Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone City Brewing;Crisp with nice hop bite and finish. There is however a flavor in the yeast profile that I do not enjoy.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;I used to grab this when I was missing my German alt. I think this might still be available from the brewery in larger bottles but I haven't seen it on the store shelves in a few months. This bottle was worth hanging on to for quasi sentimental reasons, and I'm glad I didn't pour it down the drain, but I'm not going to miss it, either.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;Has a skunky flavor. It appears to suffer from quality control as do all of the Artist colony beers I have tried. Too much acidic and yeast taste.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;I saw the rating directly onder mine and was almost scarred off, but this is a darn good beer. I wouldn't rate it as a top beer, but it's a nice sip while I surf the net.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;Cloudy brown with a decent beige head. Sour dough with a touch of roasted malt aroma. Very thin feel with a acidic malt flavor and finish. A dry brown ale that seems to be fermented out with an off yeast. Dry and acidic.
Stone City Artist Colony Ale;Solon, Iowa, United States;Brown Ale;Stone City Brewing;A little confused in the finish. Decent looking pint, just some background sourness that is a bit off putting. I usually only have one per session, as the sour finish becomes too much after a couple of them. Still I like to support my local.
Stone City Stein Bock;Solon, Iowa, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stone City Brewing;BASED ON NOTES from about two years ago, when I first had this (so take this for what it's worth). The brewery, I'm told, has since gone out of business. For the quality of beer these guys were making, I always thought the six packs were overpriced, but I'm no marketing expert. Packaging and reputation made me think I was getting a primo craft brew, but it was really pretty ordinary (though not terrible) craft brew. Here goes: Sweet and fruity, but not as full feeling (body, mouthfeel) as other bocks I've tried. It's like a bock trying to be something else. Too much sweetness and not enough crispness from hops.
Stone City Stein Bock;Solon, Iowa, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Stone City Brewing;Overly sweet in both the start and the finish. Lacking in the smoothness and cleanliness that for me makes bocks good. Kind of clumsy and too fruity.
Stone City Stone Bluff Pilsener;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stone City Brewing;Not a good pilsener at all. Cloudy, looked more like a hefe-weizen than a pils. I mean, c'mon, a pilsener is supposed to be crystal clear. Great head though, lasted the whole beer, rings for every sip. Taste was good, but not really like a pilsener should taste. All in all it was a good beer just to drink but a very poor example of the style.
Stone City Stone Bluff Pilsener;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stone City Brewing;Cloudy, dirty straw color with a moderate off white head. Citric, sour, vinegar aroma. Initial flavor of sweet malt that goes to a orange and lemon sourness. Fairly dry in the finish with a slight graininess. Not much of a pils. Would rate slightly higher as a kolsch or cream ale, albeit not much.
Stone City Stone Bluff Pilsener;Solon, Iowa, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Stone City Brewing;Fermented way too warm to be a good true pilsener. Quite fruity and lacking in the crispness and cleanliness departments.
Stone City Stone Mansion Stout;Solon, Iowa, United States;Stout;Stone City Brewing;Brown highlights, quickly dissipating head. Roasty aromas. Bitter, roasty flavors. Bitter, dryish finish. Over-carbed and a little lacking in mouthfeel for an oatmeal stout. One dimensional.
Stone City Stone Mansion Stout;Solon, Iowa, United States;Stout;Stone City Brewing;Nearly balck with a thin light tan head. Dark malt, grass, hay and urine aroma. Sweet roasted flavor with a fairly creamy feel. A touch aserbic. A sweet oatmeal stout.
Stone City Stone Mansion Stout;Solon, Iowa, United States;Stout;Stone City Brewing;This was very pleasant. Rich stout with a creamy mouthfeel. Much more choclatey than it is roasty, but still feels more like a stout than a porter. Finishes with a singular blast of roasty malt and cascade? hop blast. Quite well done.
Stone City Stone Mansion Stout;Solon, Iowa, United States;Stout;Stone City Brewing;Thin and brittle, with dry roast malt flavours and little else. ...........

MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours amber and hazy with a white head. Smells of sweet caramel, citrus, oaky. Tastes dry and uninspired with a sweet citrussy finish and lots of bitterness hanging around.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle. Poured a hazy brown body with thin head. Aroma is hops, some wood. Flavor is malty, lightly bitter hoppiness and some oak. Odd bitterness to it.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12 oz. bottle pours an amber colored fluid with a slight white head. Smell is woody, with smoked malts, and a subtle hop aroma. Medium bodied with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. Taste has a strong malt presence followed by a tasty hop bitterness. A unique taste here, definately not your typical West Coast IPA. nov 2004.... 2007 update : with all the barrel aged beers nowdays, how come there’s not more aged IPA or DIPA’s out there? Because this beer wasn’t a huge success doesn’t mean the style is not suited to aging, does it ?
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Had this beer on 3/20/1999 when it was known as Woodstock IPA. Color is a deep gold with a touch of brown, carbonation is good but head seems a bit thin. Aroma is a lightly sweet malt scent. Taste is very oakey, reminds me of Jack Daniel’s. It starts with a medium body as it goes down and oak taste begins. The finish begins with the oak flavor taking on a sharpness and some mild bitterness comes through. Overall the oak makes for a little too sharp of a bite for me but I think this is what they wanted it to be like. It’s probably a good beer for when you feel like having a Whiskey but don’t want to drink hard alcohol.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);An enjoyable IPA with a good character, although for me not one that stands out in any way either. If I could buy this beer regularly, I might drink it occasionally as a table beer but do not consider it one to seek out as a special one.
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle @ Oliver Twist, Stockholm. Pours a clear amber color with a small off-white head.

MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);(Bottle, Oliver Twist, Stockholm) Amber colour with brief white head. Fruity, hoppy nose with notes of rubber, oak and dried fruit. Fruity taste with balanced notes of hops, dried fruit, wood, vanilla and rubber. Rather sweet. Tasty and nice, well balanced. But can’t help feeling something is missing (some dry hopping?).
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Poured a clear copper color with a small head that dissapated to a thin cap. The nose was of orange and grapefruit meat along with some grassy notes. The taste started with a nice balance of light malt, yeasty fruit, and citrusy/sprucy hops. Notes of oak, vanilla, toasty breads and caramel malts appear in the end; followed by a solid bitterness in the finish that rise up to leave it dry and refreshing. This isn’t a text book IPA, but it is really good, reasonably complex, and very easy to drink. You can’t ask for more than that... can you?"
MacTarnahans Oak-Aged IPA;Portland, United States;IPA;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A cloudy copper color with an off white head that laces nicely. A kind of citrus like aroma. Dry taste with a hint of citrus, lemon I think. Pretty good.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A nice solid beer with only hints of honey in both aroma and taste. It brings a slight tart flavor but finishes well.

MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle from the local Costco. Pours a clear dark golden color with a fairly thick white head on it. Nose isn’t all that appealing - I get just a light bit of sand and wheat to it, and little else. Tastes light and slightly sweet. Not bad, but nothing special.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This beer is absolutely delicious in the bottle, and even better if you can find it on draft. Very highly recommended.
MacTarnahans Oregon Honey Beer;Portland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);bottle. hey it tastes like honey! kind of fruity too. not something I’d want to drink a lot of.
MacTarnahans Amber Ale (Macs Ale);Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I love red ales and Portland brewing serves up another winner. Too me, a red or amber ale needs a strong slightly sweet malt balance to the ubiquitous northwest hops and this stuff is right on the money. Pours from a bomber bought in gresham Oregon as an almost cloudy deep amber color with nice head. I absolutely love the toning down of the hops. It is an amber you know! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
MacTarnahans Amber Ale (Macs Ale);Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);My very first Oregonian beer in Oregon, and not a bad start--love the appearance, love the caramel, though obviously it's too hoppy for this user.

Portland Brewing Haystack Black Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);This is one of my favorite Microbrews. It has a unique flavor with a nice finish. It doesn’t overpower the palate, nor does it linger for a long period of time. If you’re a dark beer lover pick up a Haystack Black and give it a go. Note: If you find a bottle in a basement...best to leave it and go buy one fresh.

Mistake made, lesson learned. Very watery, no flavor, and funky aftertaste made this a bad bottle of what looks like was a decent beer at one point in time.
Portland Brewing Haystack Black Porter;Portland, United States;Porter;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a nice brownish black color.

Newcastle Brown Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Farve: mørk brun farve med lidt cremet skum. Aroma: søde karamelnoter Smag: medium fylde med noter af karamel og toffee. Mild floral humle.
Newcastle Brown Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;John Smiths (Heineken UK);"550ml bottle brewed in England at 4.7%. Dark brown, slight metallic orange with the light going through it. Good-sized so-so lasting head. Sweet, somewhat complex yet oddly stereotypical-feeling toffee malt aroma - hints of dandelion & burdock. Low carbonation. Mild grassy hops and then toffee malt and biscuit malt and even some roasted malt take centre stage for the duration. Possibly one-dimensional but plays around within that dimension a fair bit. Sweet and absolutely malt-forward, in parts refreshing, maybe even slightly watery, but mostly cloying. Really not bad, though, and very fun to compare and contrast this with the similar style of a German dunkel! Not necessarily a fair comparison though; you might want to find a better representative for the brown ale style - this is very noticeably commercialised on the palate, even if it is easy drinking (that's Heineken for you). I might call this a ""radio beer"" - it's a bit like those songs you like on the radio that you always tune in quick and turn the volume up to listen to, but only because they're much better than the standard radio fare - you'd very rarely if at all actually go and put them on if you happened to be in control of what music was playing. This beer serves as a good sign of what ale drinkers look for in their beer that lager doesn't have - have one of these and a typical bottled lager side by side and the fundamental nature of the difference in the two styles should quickly become apparent."

Newcastle Brown Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Bottiglia. Il gusto al naso è indirizzato verso l'orzo tostato.

Newcastle Brown Ale;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;John Smiths (Heineken UK);A light reddish brown colour with an off white head of a fair formation and retention.

Bass Pale Ale (USA and export);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);A very historical beer, but the quality didn't quite match. Lack of richness from the malt makes it a little watery. I definitely will have London Pride or ESB rather than this next time.

Bass Pale Ale (USA and export);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"Bottle from Tesco. Pours a thin white head with mediocre retention. Clear and lightly sparkling body. Copper amber colour. Nose is very much of the classic ""British beer"" and definitely has what I identify as the Bass characteristic. Also candied fruit, hops and malt. Also hard water, a hint of sulphur and maybe hop extract. Taste is bitter with some metallic notes. Lightly carbonated mouthfeel. Dry finish. Body is a little thin, but with a full mouthfeel somehow. Overall a good classic English bitter, and very much an atypical example of the style."

Young's Bitter (Bottle);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);10. 12. 2017, Ljubljana. Bottled. Almost no aroma at all. Looks aight.

Young's Bitter (Bottle);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Too carbonated for me. Kind of a lower grade bitter as it was rather watery/thin.

Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottled (BBE 2003, from old bottle collection). Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is mild fruits, zest, some slight cardboard (surprisingly little cardboard actually), Flavour is zest, mild grassy, mild citrus and some herbal and grassy notes. Mild cardboard too. Has aged surprisingly well considering the age and the clear bottle.

Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;A bit stale after sitting in the cellar for six years but tonight with dinner it was quite good considering. I had forgotten about it since my trip there in late 2000 and just had it stashed away in a box of brewing equip in the basement. Still quite nice in the glass with thin carbonation. Not as much passion fruit as I remember but nice with rice and chicken. I hope they bring this one back.
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;A light golden yellow beer with a thickish head. An extremely fruity aroma of mangoes and passionfruits, and a hint of roses. The taste is distinctive, exotic fruits, again mangoes and passionfruits, as well as sweetened bananas, with a slight bitterness in the finish. (Bottle).
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottle 28/06/2004 Clear golden coloured with pale, fruit and hoppy aromas. Orange flavour. Crisp lasting malt finish.
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;(Bottle 50 cl) Pretty, golden beer presented in a clear glass bottle - decent head. Strong, floral hoppy aroma. Flavours are dominated by perfumy passion fruit (really hope it’s natural flavours), but the fruity sweetness that would be expected never surface. Instead you get a very light and dry beer - not much bitterness though. I reckon this would work as a summer quencher, it’s just not the worlds most harmonious brew. 260402
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottled. Bright golden, Aroma of peach and passion fruit. Juicy peaches atop sweet dense malt, balanced by some grassy hops. This is a fruit beer that works, at least to some extent.
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottle. Very pale gold. Elderflower, passion fruit, Irn Bru, metal, carbonation aroma - all a little prickly. Medium to light bodied. Neutral palate. Pretty much the same all the way through, just like a cheap lager. Cheap lager with a splash more character.
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;No doubt the clear bottle is intended to show off the colour, but I can't help think it looks like piss. Passion fruit eh? Tastes like flat lager with some sort of tropical fruit extract concentrate. One of Youngs least impressive efforts. I should say, however, that (with the exception of a good sour kreik) I have never really had a fruit flavoured beer that I have enjoyed, so others might find it more to their taste. Syrian hops? That's a new one on me. Bottled (500ml)
Youngs Acclaim;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottled. Clear bright yellow body with a fine white head. Fruity aroma, accurately reflecting the passionfruit infusion. Acidic, fruity, citrus flavour. Moderate bitterness with a medium palate.

Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;50 cl bottle. Past its sell-by date. Amber ale with white head, a little cloudy. Smells of hops. Some sweetness, a sharp bitterenss in the finish. Oily. A bit off, it was probably better when fresh. Too bad it is not around for another try!
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;500 ml bottle. Amber coloured with a hint of haziness, probably because it is past its best before date. Small white head. Sharp citrus hoppy edge with an acidic twang. Somewhat thin-bodied. Something has happened to it as it is off. Thin and sharp hop acidicity. Has seemingly been a light refreshing bitter in its youth.
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Small white head. Amber body with a slight haze. Mild nutty hop aroma with something funny in the background kind of like gasoline (may be because the beer is 9 months past the sell-by date). Taste is watery chalky paper and bitterness. It must be too old, so I’m rating it a bit leniently, given that I’ll probably never be able to re-rate. This probably was a nice bitter when they bottled it. (0.5l bottle, thanks to Knut Albert.)
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;looks good, lightbrown with a thin head. smells citrussy. taste: citrus(grapefruit, lemon), bit of caramel and a bit bitter. a bit too thin body, but very drinkable.
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottle. A touch of lemon, stewed hops. Thin, overcarbonated. Boring pasteurised beer.
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Had a bottle last year and wasn’t overly impressed. This time I quite enjoyed it: it’s a light, straightforward, uncomplicated beer for drinking quickly when you’ve got a thirst rather than savouring slowly. It looked good, had an acceptable bitterness, and the sour taste was agreeable enough
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Bottle from sainsbury. Golden brown colour, floral hops with citric notes. lots of lemon in the flavour but it makes it taste like lemonade. not enough malt to give it any structure or body. shame cos i love Lord’s. Just a wonderful place and this beer is not fit to share its name
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Aroma is super super hoppy. Taste is same but just hops and water, needs somethign else, infact needs alot more.
Youngs Lords Beer;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Young's;Typical pasteurised English summer session ale. Amber colour, short diminishing head. Some crisp green apple notes in the hoppy nose are undermined by cardboardy malt and that pasteurised boiled vege smell. Thin bodied and quenching. Appetisingly bitter, with apple notes.

Young's Double Chocolate Stout;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"This beer really remind me the famous ""Fuller's Porter"" that also is from ""England"". This perhaps has little more chocolate and coffe inside but also it is more bitter and has less sweetness inside.. And more carbonation that is good. The first mouthfeel is slightly bitter that i'm not fan for that but the aftertaste is amazing.. The aftertaste is endless and you feel very good chocolate and coffe taste in your mouth.. Really one of the best aftertaste i have get from one beer.. Overall is a decent and refreshing beer to drink any season you want.. ""Stout"" beers is not my style but this one is really a very good beer despite the style."

Aroma of chocolate, roast malts, nuts. Taste of dark chocolate, nuts, roast malts, the chocolate is fairly light in intensity, almost underwhelming, bittersweet, the finish is bitter and ever so slightly metallic. Medium bodied, smooth, very nice for the ABV. It's not doing much for me really, guess I've been spoiled by craft beer in the past few years as this is lacklustre in comparison, I'm sure it was fantastic back in the day though.
Young's Double Chocolate Stout;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Wow... simply amazing. For ABV lots of body. Not alot of alchol. Low ABV my new goal.. and the real challenge of brewing. American Breweries haven't figured it out. the english are experts. This is nitro. Lasting head. Full body. Sweet and obvious chocolate. A perfect recipe. Wow nice.
Young's Double Chocolate Stout;Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);"The flatest ""beer"" I ever had the questionable privilege of drinking. No clue what they little ""pressurized container"" inside tye can is for but the beer is 100% flat. All it's got is a nice looking head. Tastes like you poured it at noon and left it standing until 20:00. I.am sure it could have some nice taste but as flat as it is therr is just no way for any flavor to develop."

Aroma is nutty, malty, slightly caramelly, sweet floral, elderflower. Taste is malty, mild hopiness, caramelly, floral, dried banana. Some alcoholy notes in aftertaste. Medium body, high carbonation. First impression is really nice. But if even in really low temp there is still quite detectable alcohol only with 6.4% abv beer, then it's bit out of balance for me. Overally still drinkable

Youngs Extra Light;Wandsworth, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Young's;Yippee. Low alcohol ticked off my list of beer styles without having to resort to one of those ghastly low alcohol lagers. That’s the good news. The bad news is the beer itself. As others have said its all old dull malt and not much else. No hops to speak of. Thank God we were sharing and I didn’t have to drink the whole thing myself. And I see now that I marked it higher than the others - must be getting overgenerous. Bottled at Youngs Brewery Tap, February 2005.

Deep copper color, fluffy head with perfect lacing. Just a bit sweeter than the typical ESB. The hops swept evenly along the tongue however, balancing out the maltiness rather well.

Oldenberg Premium Verum;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Oldenberg Brewing Company;I guess this was a pilsner as that's how its listed. I tend not to like pilsners simply because they are slight. This is pretty much the same. Slight. Watery. Slight hops. Light in color. I enjoyed it while I drank it because it was beautiful day and I was completely relaxed at the time. So it hit the spot but not because of the flavor.
Oldenberg Premium Verum;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Oldenberg Brewing Company;A decent beer, good hops and malt nose and flavor, a strong beer, not suited for everyone.

Oldenberg Pious Pale Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oldenberg Brewing Company;"Bottled version of this brew showed up at the bar I work at on Friday. One of the perks of being a bartender is you can get a few ""shift drinks"" after closing. I had a Brooklyner Weisse first and then decided to give a Pious Ale a try. My sampled poured flat in the glass with no aroma, or flavor. Hops were long gone and I was not impressed. I read here the brewery is out of business so I can only guess how old these beer actually are. The Grey Lodge Pub has four cases of Pious Ale, I have a feeling we’ll have these beers in our fridge for some time to come."

Oldenberg Pious Pale Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Oldenberg Brewing Company;"Tried this at the Cincinnati (N.Kentucky) Airport; what a way to spend a layover. The beer was extremely well-hopped - aroma- and flavor-wise. Had a slightly malty, sweet ""backdrop"" for which the fresh and tasty hops were staged. Def one of the best beers I've had in an airport. If you're ever in the Cinci airport, head over to Concourse C (I think it was). A really impressive brew."

Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;From a twelve ounce bottle purchased at the Glenway Crossing IGA - This one pours a fizzy, dark brown liquid with a malty aroma and a lasting tan head of foam. Tastewise, it’s a bit light on body for a brown ale, but it is good!
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;"RIP I'll give it a rate 'cause I drank the beer and have the notes. On Tap at an airport. I asked for a description of their offerings and got the ""this one's a lager, this one's a Pilsner"" stuff from the server. When I told him Pilsners were lagers he agreed that they were both made with bottom fermenting yeast. So I don't know if he knew what he was talking about or not! Anyway it was a decent but uninspiring brown ale. And in an airport any thing is better than a Bud light with cigarette smoke. Just an average brown ale nevertheless."
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;Hands down the worst beer I have ever had. Not bad in the standard way, no flavor watery and fizzy. No bad in a whole new what the heck did I drink mish-mash of sweetness and sourness and bizzare malt. Legendary. Avoid at all costs. You have been warned.
Oldenberg Holy Grail Nut Brown Ale;Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, United States;Brown Ale;Oldenberg Brewing Company;Decent malty ale, description of this beer fits it perfectly, I also prefer Samuel Smiths. Then again SS makes a lot of good ones. I just wish that Oldenberg's restaurant was still open here in Louisville, it went from being voted #1 new restaurant in 1999 to closing a few years later, We had some good times there.

Samuel Adams Cream Stout;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Boston Beer Company;I must say, this is definitely one of the better beers I've had from Samuel Adams in recent memory, and this was also definitely my favorite of the varieties included in the 2019 Samuel Adams winter mix pack. Poured a ruby brown-accented black coffee color with white khaki foam, looks like a cup of medium roast coffee with a splash of cream. Aroma is light roasted coffee bean with a touch of milky sweetness. Flavor follows with a coffee-and-cream profile and additional notes of milk chocolate and roasted malt bitterness. A touch of subtle English hop bitterness also. Medium-bodied and smooth, a very satisfying middle of the road stout, not too mild or too intense. Overall this was an enjoyable winter seasonal beer that offers a little extra complexity, I would buy this again as a standalone six-pack if it were offered as such.

Samuel Adams Golden Pilsener;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Boston Beer Company;Overall Impression: A Sam offering that I haven’t tried in a while (and I guess that would make sense since it’s retired), but I remember this being rather dull and average, so not too much of a loss...
Samuel Adams Golden Pilsener;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Boston Beer Company;I’m a huge fan of Sam’s Lager and also their stronger specialty offerings. The multitudes of other beers they offer don’t excite me all that much This is one of those others.
Samuel Adams Golden Pilsener;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Boston Beer Company;What happened to this one? I have not seen it for ages! Huge fan of anything brewed by Sam Adams, but I have to say this one was a bit weak. Sam Adams beers are usually hoppy, and this one was light on the hops, maltiness and aroma. One of the weaker brews put out by this excellent brewery I am sorry to say..
Samuel Adams Golden Pilsener;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Boston Beer Company;I am not a Sam Adams fan, but this was the exception. I loved this beer. By far the best product they ever made. In my mind this was a perfect beer.
Samuel Adams Golden Pilsener;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Boston Beer Company;I drank this a few years ago from what I remember. It wasnt anything special. Nothing to write home about. If you want a pilsner, dont look here. There are TONS better.

It's definitely not something I'd want to drink every day and the alcohol is there in abundance but it's a good sipper and it's tasty. I give it a moderate thumbs up.

Samuel Adams White Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Boston Beer Company;"I didn't care too much for this as a Wit. Just like their Hef, it did seemed ""Americanized"".....a little watery and lacking flavor. I always said that all Sammy Adams has a certain similar taste.....can't quite pinpoint it. I don't notice it as much in their Brewmaster Collections, which is probably why I prefer them more to the regular Sammys. UPDATED 12/7/10- I am getting more and more into Sammys, and this is one that I have to upgrade. Hoppier than last remembered, and the balance is working quite well."

Way to much cherry in an unnatural way.

Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Boston Beer Company;12oz bottle. Pours a lightly hazy pale amber with a thin white head. Pure cherry candy on the nose. Nothing that even comes close to resembling a real cherry, with some faint malt notes underneath, yet you know what? I love the smell of cherry candy, so I'm in! Taste wise, cherry candy up front with light malt, and some wheat bitterness that leads into more of the wheat notes with more of the cherry candy throughout. I understand this is not a beer of great integrity, but I like it. It's like the Cherry Coke of beer, and honestly, in the summer weather, this stuff is more than welcome in my fridge.

A nice thick drape remains on the beer. Looks good. The aroma of the beer is nice, but it is a tiny bit mild. I wish the aromas would have been stronger and more robust. There are nice malts, that give some caramel notes. There is a hint of toast too. Hops are herbal. There are some hints of cinnamon. The ginger is there to, though very very mild. There orange peel I can't rally detect. The taste of the beer is good too. But, it isn't too strong. Sweetness from malts, with some hop derived bitterness. The spices give a nice touch to the flavour. It is well balanced. Not bad at all. But, a tiny bit mild. I'd like it to be stronger. The palate of the beer is fine. Medium light body, smooth texture and rather low carbonation. The finish of the beer has some nice spicy notes in it. The ginger becomes clear. Also some of the orange zest is present there. Again, it is not too strong, but it is nice. Decent beer it is."

Samuel Adams Summer Ale ( - 2018);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Boston Beer Company;My favorite of the Sam Adams but as I see from others it's not for everyone. I prefer my beers to have a stronger bread-like taste to anything else and that's why I love this beer. If you enjoy a strong bread flavor, especially after taste you will like this beer.

Samuel Adams Summer Ale ( - 2018);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Boston Beer Company;"When the summer solstice is well nigh here, you can rest assured that those sun worshipping pagans of old, The Milwaukeeans are not idolizing their Gods with this tripe. And that's a true fact well-stated, or not. Indeed, those wily fuckers have the gumption enough to worship the olden ones with that true pleasure elixir from the Elysian Fields: Blatz. As a wise man once said, ""If it ain't Blatz, it ain't shit."" So if you want to be cast out of your pagan circle you could roll with this stuff, but when you're looking to come in for the big win, load your bloated carcass up on Blatz....that's the stuff 33 of 77 Pagans polled for this review use to summon the gods of old......

Palate is medium bodied with smooth texture, lively carbonation and finish as taste. Overall, beautiful appearance but this combination of malts and hops always reminds me a bit of unfinished wort I made as a home brewer.

Butte Creek Organic Porter;Ukiah, California, United States;Porter;Butte Creek Brewing Company;First sample from Butte Creek. A good clean, lighter porter. A little on the thin side and lacking some flavor. Similar to some of the porters that come from the UK. Pours a darker brown appearance. Flavors of barley and chocolate malt. Nice to try and organic and all, but I prefer a thicker/maltier porter with a bit more hop to it.
Butte Creek Organic Porter;Ukiah, California, United States;Porter;Butte Creek Brewing Company;12oz Flasche. Dunkelbraunes fast schwarzes Bier, beiger flacher Schaum. Es duftet und schmeckt nach Röstmalz, dunkler Schokolade und etwas Kaffee. Recht süffig.

Butte Creek Organic Porter;Ukiah, California, United States;Porter;Butte Creek Brewing Company;"Dark brown with almost no lacing. Very weak nose of light malt, some toffee and grains. And you really have to sniff hard for it. Taste is more noticeable; consisting of roasted barley, some coffee and chocolate. Very thin,watery body. The flavor is there, but could use a little more character."
Butte Creek Organic Porter;Ukiah, California, United States;Porter;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Very dark brown pour with a very small brown head. There wasn’t a whole lot of lacing left in the glass. The body was extremely light and very bland on the flavors. I got a small hint of cream and chocolate with some really light and grassy hops, but that was about it. This beer was very short on flavor.
Butte Creek Organic Porter;Ukiah, California, United States;Porter;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle. Coffee, chocolate barley malt and hay aroma. Very dark brown with moderate tan head.

Butte Creek Organic Porter;Ukiah, California, United States;Porter;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Nice nutty aroma and nice malty flavor with a hint of smoky. A little light (color) for a porter but tasty and slightly refreshing- surprising for a porter ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Butte Creek Organic Porter;Ukiah, California, United States;Porter;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Dark cola-colored beer with a rich light beige root beer head. Rather weak nose of cocoa, nuts, and dark grain, but you need to search for it. Flavor is thankfully stronger with chocolate, almond, and toffee giving way quickly to a light roasted bitterness, but nothing lingers particularly long. The mouth feel is a bit thin for a porter too. Ok I guess, but so many better options for this style.
Butte Creek Organic Porter;Ukiah, California, United States;Porter;Butte Creek Brewing Company;"I bought three bottles of Butte Creek beers when I was at Mendocino’s taproom in Ukiah and all but one seem to be old. That’s a really terrible way to run a taproom (but that’s the subject for another sermon). Of the three that were old, Butte Creek Organic Porter has at least held up fairly well. Tangy to be sure, but the base brew is still detectable. I’m sure this would be more than simply an above-average beer when it’s fresh. I poured a 12oz bottle into a nonic pint glass. It was bottled on 8/31/14 and cost $3 ($0.25 per ounce). Appearance: Dark brown hue, though more of a dark burgundy when held up to the light. Pours to a small layer of tan foam which never completely dissipates and leaves minor lacing. Smell: Sweet dark malts with slight fruity character. Mild though. Taste: What separates porters from stouts is that they rely on their sweetness rather than intensely roasted and bitter malts. That’s evident here as there’s no roasty sensation at all, though it’s certainly nothing in the amber malt range. Mild notes of dark fruit or dried fruit with a hint of milk chocolate and perhaps some iced coffee undertones. I do get some slight metallic or astringent tanginess on the finish, but it’s fairly minor. What’s here is at least enjoyable, but not amazing. Drinkability: For an old bottle, Butte Creek Organic Porter still drinks surprisingly easy. The mouthfeel is a little tepid, but in no way flat or watery. Soft and smooth in texture with a finish to match; it leaves virtually no aftertaste. At 6% ABV it should have more body and complexity than this, though. Perhaps it does when it’s fresh but it’s unlikely I’ll ever know. Score: 6/10"

Butte Creek Rolands Red;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours bold burnt red with very thin off-white head. The malty aroma contains burnt sugar, lots of biscuit, and some very subtle hops. The flavor is ashy hops, toasted malt, and slight bitterness in the finish. Not bad.
Butte Creek Rolands Red;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Pours amber with a fully receding tan head. Aroma of mild ale fruits, buttescotch, and flowery hops. Taste is sweet and malty, notes of caramel, plums, toffee, and strangefruit. This seems to be the theme of the night.

Butte Creek Rolands Red;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Jax Beer and Wine - Atlanta, Ga - 12 oz. bottle. Medium copper pour, light, off white head. Sharp, olive oil like aroma with a cotton candy swwetness in the back end. Flavor has some candied sugar notes, some ripening vegetable notes. Some malty biscuity notes find theri way in there as well and finishes with a slight citrusy bent. Thick mouthfeel, but verging on cloyness. Odd for an English Pale Ale.
Butte Creek Rolands Red;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Amber with fruity, malty aromas. Lots of hops start this one off, but they trail off at the end. Bitter, grapefruit-flavored finish. Somewhat watery, but refreshing and dry.
Butte Creek Rolands Red;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Wow, I think I got an old bottle, floaties until I finished this one, a thick, thick, layer on the bottom of the bottle.

Butte Creek Gold Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Not an APA, just a golden ale , since its focus is on the malts. Which are very nice with apple and honeyish flavours. Good palate. A nice balanced west-coast beer.
Butte Creek Gold Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;A deep yellow color. Wouldn't think this was a pale ale. Not much of an aroma and ho hops from the taste. Kind of boring actually. Don't expect much from this beer.
Butte Creek Gold Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle. Very light for a Pale ale. This beer lacks Hops and malts to be a good pale. However it does drink crisp and clean. A good alternative to american lagers. It's got more flavor than lagers but drinks light for a pale.
Butte Creek Gold Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Nice rich aroma, but that's the highlight for this beer. Lame label, supercarbonated. Too fizzy. Better as it warms, getting some caramel.
Butte Creek Gold Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Appearance is a cloudy yellow with little head but good lacing. Aroma is citrusy mainly oranges. Flavor is slightly hoppy with some grapefruit and oranges present. Light bodied. Decent for a summer beer but it doesn't hold a candle to many APA's Ive had.
Butte Creek Gold Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;"Initial malty aroma, not overly hoppy for an APA. Later, a grapefruit nose comes through from ""lots"" of American hops. Grapefruit comes through in the flavor as well but with pretty low astringency. Malt flavors are subdued but still present. I disagree with some of the raters that its too bitter but I do think it's got too many flavor hops. The grapefruit extends even to the aftertaste."
Butte Creek Gold Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Decent colour, not better than any other APA i've ever had...fairly light in colour compared to those. Decent taste, but not much of an APA...more of a normal ale.
Butte Creek Creekside Wheat;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;I had this beer a while back and from what I can remember I enjoyed it. I’ve had this at the pub/brewery so it was fresh. Nothing special about it is popping into my head at the moment.

Yes they still have this, even though no one has rated it in a year and a half. It poured a hazy yellow, with a one finger white head. The aroma was spicy with cloves dominating.

Butte Creek Creekside Wheat;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;A light golden color with just a tad of cloudiness, this is forgiving to the palate but no hefeweizen. Tastes lightly of vanilla with a bit of lemon zest thrown in. A bit hoppy for a wheat beer. A good credible brew, but nothing to get worked up over.
Butte Creek Creekside Wheat;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;According to the descriptions, this has aspirations towards being a hefeweizen. In reality, it’s a mediocre American wheat, clear golden in body with a modest white head. It smells of Wheaties witha very slight hint of banana and a light zest of lemon tartness. The wheat remains in the flavor and the banana is lost. The lemon zest turns into a bitterness that lasts into the finish. Friar Tuck Wines, Sprirts, & Beverages, Bloomington, IL
Butte Creek Creekside Wheat;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Decent, with alot of upfront yeastiness, a big puffy white head and a hint of cloudy haze in the golden pour. Smooth and creamy with a nice bitter bite in the finish. Defeinitely one of the best things ever to come out of Butte Creek and exceptionally good for an American style wheat.
Butte Creek Creekside Wheat;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;A nice deep golden pour with just a slight haze. A white head that goes quickly. A nice fruity aroma with bannana at the front. A decent smooth palated beer for a wheat. A bitter that is rather odd. I wish I had bought a sixer so that I could really figure out what this beer is about. Not bad for a wheat.
Butte Creek Creekside Wheat;Ukiah, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;From a 12 oz. long neck brown bottle with a blurb along the left side of the label, no bottled/freshness date. Made a average appearance, poured like you would any hefe weizen, hazy orange hued yellow with a foamy white head that quickly settled into a thin lacing, medium carbonation overall. Had a nose of sweet fruity wheat malts, apples and grassy hops. A crisp and smooth lightish medium bodied mouthfeel, average drinkability. Sweet fruity wheat malt taste that is kind of bland, apples with a squirt of lemon, dry peppery, grassy hoppiness and a sweet malty and grassy finish. I wasn’t too impressed by this hefe weizen from Butte Creek, not something I will be a regular buyer of.
Butte Creek Organic Spring Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;DMS and ummm more DMS in the nose. Very vegetative and oxidized on the palate. Awful stuff.
Butte Creek Organic Spring Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bomber from Bottle Barn. Aroma is caramel and light stone fruit. Amber color with a white head that filmed rapidly. Medium bodied with near creamy carbonation. Caramel flavor, watery light stone fruits, and some bitter. The finish is pretty dry, and the bitter attacks the edges of the tongue. As it goes on, the fruit seems to take on an apricot trend. Crisp it is. Also delicious.

An Amber?"
Butte Creek Organic Spring Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;I think they may have done some recipe changes on this, this was more like a pale then an amber. Poured golden/orange, slight haze, with a tall white head. Crisp citrus hops in the finish over a fruity caramel malt base. Nice standard american pale with the big PNW hops.
Butte Creek Organic Spring Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;NorCal tasting Apr 07 - Pretty bad stuff here. While verging on a drainpour and a below average beer, it walks the line lightly. Aroma is creamed corn, oxidation and light hops. Appearance is dark gold, cloudy with a head which melts quickly. It didn’t strike me as an amber ale in color. Flavors in this weren’t very tasty either. If not served ice cold, it’s hard to quaff. Lack of character, taste and anything resembling a beer is hard find. It does carry some light caramel notes, but if you have to struggle to find them then it’s probably not the beer you are looking for.

Butte Creek Organic Spring Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Very soft aroma with not much of a profile for me to disuss about. Color is a light red color that is sort of sad to look at since this is an amber ale. Flavor is weak with only a trace of caramel thats to soft to be considerably noticed. Boring and not alive enough to be drank during the season of spring.
Butte Creek Organic Spring Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;This was a very light to medium bodied, kind of a combination between an amber and a lighter style nut brown ale. Some spicy hops, fruit maltiness througout, some caramel, and a dry chalky finish.
Butte Creek Organic Spring Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;"22 oz bomber says ""Organic Spring Ale"" on the label. Deep golden, slightly hazy ale, nice off white bubbly head. The aroma is mostly of malts, sweet and almost honeyish, slight hop aromas. In taste its mostly malt driven, semi-sweet, fruitiness, bitter near the end, hoppy after taste..quite peppery in character. After a while though the bitterness gets to be annoying. Quite a thin mouthfeel to this one, well carbonated. This is just on the right side of average, barelly, did not really enjoy."
Butte Creek Winter Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Brown Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Not sure how long this one was sitting on the shelf but it tasted like it has been for a while. Pours a dark mahogany colour with more of reddish tint near the top. Head is weak, tan coloured. Aroma is like old stale peanuts with a little bit of toffee. Taste was dirty, a little chewy in fact- again stale peanuts with a hint of toast.
Butte Creek Winter Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Brown Ale;Butte Creek Brewing Company;Bottle from BevMo. Dark mahogany pour with very thin off white head and light lacing. Aroma has a bit of a chocolate essence to it with a bit of port wine scent as well. Has more of a Porter feel and taste to it and has a bit of that grittiness to it that I noted in their Organic Porter. Some nutty notes in the flavor round it out with some trailing hoppy bitterness. Mouth feel is a tad on the thin side. Overall, decent.

Fosters Lager;Southbank, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Foster's Brewing (AB InBev);Well. International lager. Empty, watery, thirst quencher on a hot day. Sex in a kayak.

Fosters Lager;Southbank, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Foster's Brewing (AB InBev);This stuff is T E R R I B L E ! Only advantage is that when refrigerated it could be a lifesaver on a hot summers day, however if you have other beers available DRINK THEM! Bland, no unique twist or flavour, and a general waste of time and effort to drink. Drunk in the UK, thank god we don’t have this back in Switzerland!
Fosters Lager;Southbank, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Foster's Brewing (AB InBev);Being from Melbourne and Australia I had never actually tried Fosters until I went to the UK, not as bad as I expected but definitely not something I'll drink now that I've left
Fosters Lager;Southbank, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Foster's Brewing (AB InBev);This beer is definitely nothing to brag about. Probably a good life saver on a hot summer day, but nothing much more than that.

Stiegl Goldbräu;Salzburg, Austria;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;"On tap at the Salzburg Oktoberfest celebration, that they call it Rupertikirtag instead; but feels the same and is at the same time of year. We missed out on going to the StieglKeller, but still got to try the beer. Clear golden yellow with fluffy white foam that leaves moderate lace.

Stiegl Goldbräu;Salzburg, Austria;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Clear gold, white head. Clean industrial pale malts, no hops. Similar taste, just a touch of sweetness, feels over-attenuated, a bit devoid of malts character. No hops either. Ok, crisp and soft body. Clean. Low bitterness with a touch of alcohol. Just a regular macro lager.

Overall a tasty pilsner. I wish it had a more persistent ending.

Stiegl Spezial;Salzburg, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Das Spezial war ein etwas stärkeres Helles mit einem vollerem Geschmack ähnlich den 12-grädigen tschechischen Bieren. Als solches war es sehr schön zu trinken. Vielleicht nicht so frisch-spritzig, aber dafür tiefgründig-süffig. Ich habe es schon seit ein paar Jahren nicht mehr gesehen und vermute, dass es eingestellt wurde. Neben dem starken Stiegl Goldbräu ist es auch schwer ein ähnliches Bier zu etablieren.

Stiegl Spezial;Salzburg, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;"Can. Pours a lambent gold with a shallow, fine-grained, creamy white head. Nose is bread dough, cheap fruit candy, and to be honest not much else. On the tongue, there’s a little grain, a little spice, a little sweetness, a little bitterness -- and again, not much else. Some malic acid on the finish. This is beer for people who don’t like things to taste like much of anything; the perfect beer for people who just have to have plain oatmeal in the morning."
Stiegl Spezial;Salzburg, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Bottle from Beer Cartel 030915. Middle of the road beer - not great but not terrible either. Clear in the glass with a soft white head. Straw and grain in the aroma.

Stiegl Zwickl;Salzburg, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;This retired beer was decent full bodied Zwickel style beer. It was available across Austria.
Stiegl Zwickl;Salzburg, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;500ml bottle. It is a very intensive beer with much mult, hop and fine Co2. This is the nice equilibrium of ingredients. You can find some leather and fresh bread also the sticky, medium body. Colour is opal beer-yellow, as you imagine. Very nice but pricy.
Stiegl Zwickl;Salzburg, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Resembles a very grassy and grainy helles. Cloudy with a fat maltiness. Pretty dry though with balanced bitterness. Earthy and unique. Definitely worth a gander for lager fans.
Stiegl Zwickl;Salzburg, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Das Stiegl Zwickl ist tatsächlich nur 4 Monate haltbar, durchaus beachtabr, dass eine so große Brauerei auch solche Produkte im Angebot hat. Milder getreidig-malziger Antrunk, der zum Mittelteil milder zu werden scheint. Die Malzigkeit ist fast wieder verschwunden, auch die zwischenzeitlich aufgekommene Herbe ist weitestgehend verschwunden. Dagegen gefällt die Würze und die Fruchtigkeit, die sich aber leider der Milde des Bieres anpasst. Im Nachgeschmack etwas würziger, dazu malzig und minimal herb. Zuletzt zeigt sich ein Ton, der wohl bitter sein soll, was nicht ganz gelingt. Erfrischendes Sommerbier! Test vom 2.7.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 10,10,10,9,11,10 - 9,90
Stiegl Zwickl;Salzburg, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Bottle in Vienna, before it was retired (backlog). Light yellow color, very loudy. Sweet aroma of malt and yeast. Much more flavor than your average bottled zwickl. Very malty, slightly sweet, with fruit. Very good, better than any other bottled zwickl I have had. Yeast flavor is there. A decent, drinkable beer. Not mind-blowing, but closer to the better draught unfiltered beers than anything else in a bottle.
Stiegl Zwickl;Salzburg, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Stieglbrauerei zu Salzburg;Draught at Stiegl Biergarten, Salzburg. Hazy yellow, white head. Malty vegetable aroma. Malty bready flavor, some wheat. Quite mild malty finish.

Hart Cream Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Banks Canada;Yellow. Soft and creamy. Medium bodied withsome late bitterness. ..........
Hart Cream Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Cream Ale;Banks Canada;Am I the only one who finds that the brewer's description up top contradicts itself about eight times? But about the beer - not interesting out of the bottle. When I had it on cask at the Manx Pub in Ottawa it was pretty much a whole different beer it was so flavourful.
Hart Amber Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Lightly hazed amber body with small off-white head. Aroma is moderately sweet, orange, hoppy, some honey, light earthy. Taste is medium sweet, hoppy (orange, some earthy), grapefruit. Medium sweet. Definitely English, not American, style.

Hart Amber Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Via trade with Lubiere and Capflu. Clear copper orange with an off white head. Aroma is fruity, with a cooked corn/vegetable note. Flavor has a decent hop component and a nice malt backbone, with cooked corn again. I guess some people look for that sort of flavor, for it seems intentional, but is not quite my thing.
Hart Amber Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Pours light amber and cloudy. Small white head. Grassy caramel nose. Earthy and wood. Mild pepper and tangerine. Vanilla. Trace of maple sugar. Acidy sour milk in the finish.

Hart Amber Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;341 ml bottle. Dark amber, smallish lasting head, quite bubbly in the body. Pretty decent caramel nose with hints of dates and grass. Fair amount of caramel in the body, piney and slightly smoky hoppiness, rather dry to finish. Solid if nothing exciting.
Hart Amber Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Nice amber coloured ale. Good head. Bitter aftertaste sneaks up on you. More hoppy bitterness than I expected in an Amber ale. A good pint.
Hart Amber Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Had it on draught at a charity function in Ottawa. Tasted infected with lacto-bacillus. Smelled like cheese. This beer was served to us by the owners!Shame.
Hart Amber Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Amber, as you could have guessed. Coarse bubbles form a quick falling head. Nice fruity aroma and fresh hops. The first attack is of caramely malt, then come the hops. Nice bitter but smooth finish.
Hart Amber Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Banks Canada;Lambent peppery hops in deprived caramel...Spicy oranges in bubbly cereal...A gateway to the good beer world...
Hart Valley;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);The label on the one I rated, read, Hart Valley Gold? Faint malt and fruit aroma, gold in colour with a small off white head. Nice malt presence at the front, crisp in the middle, hoppy toward the finish. Apple like sweetness, a fair beer.
Hart Valley;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);When stuck in the Ottawa Valley do what the locals do: Get out of town! Only kidding. This microbrew must have some redeeming qualities, however I have yet to find one.

Hart Valley;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Robinson Brewing (Canada);"Light bronze colour; palate is mild, with some light malt notes, a faint Continental hop bitterness, which then switches to an English hop finish."

Hart Dragon's Breath Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Robinson Brewing (Canada);If you can get by the smell you can experience a below average pale ale with an crusty aftertaste.
Hart Dragon's Breath Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Some fruity notes, but a bitterness that seems to be a bit much. Not a lot too much, just a little. But I did like this beer, gentle carbonation and nicely refreshing.
Hart Dragon's Breath Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Robinson Brewing (Canada);honey colour, nice head, well-hopped, bitter, long aftertaste...............
Hart Dragon's Breath Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Robinson Brewing (Canada);I've mostly had it on tap at it's home microbrewery in Kingston, not the version brewed and destributed by Hart, and it has a very definitive character and flavor. No complaints here.
Hart Dragon's Breath Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;IPA;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Goldings out the yin-yang, if that's your sort of thing. Me, I live here, and since three quarters of Ontario ales are made with nothing but Goldings, it gets old quickly.
Hart Pumpkin Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Banks Canada;Golden color, quick falling head, spicy pumpkin aroma. Lots of carbonation but still a creamy mouthfeel somehow. Peppery squash flavor. I'm not sure I like this whole pumpkin beer thing. The beer was also too sweet for my tastes.
Hart Pumpkin Ale;Carleton Place, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Banks Canada;Damp pumpkin seeds and sweet peaches scavenging iron scraps...The more I drink it, the more I lower the scores...I think I'll stop now if you don't mind...

Hart Cranberry Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);Fruit, malt aroma, peach colour, small vanilla head. Peach, apricot, and a hint of wheat? flavour. Very creamy, smooth quite the tongue tingle, tart. Nice on tap.

Hart Cranberry Ale;Mississauga, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Robinson Brewing (Canada);I'm not so huge on fruit beers in general, but this was still disappointing.

Moosehead Lager;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;12oz bottle consumed during the World Series with samalito. Because the Nationals used to be in Montreal. Imperial pint glass. Straw golden color with minimal head. Smells a little like cat piss and grainy sweetness. Taste is sweet grain with some hoppy bitterness. If you blindfolded me, I would have said it's a Rolling Rock. This just isn't very good. Lingering bitterness...feels like a beer you'd drink if you're trying to save some money. Oh Canada.

Moosehead Lager;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;This beer taste almost exactly like Polish beer Lech. One of the top beers in the country that is OK, very popular but not the top one. Suprisingly Moosehead taste quite good comparing to what I have expected.

Moosehead Pale Ale;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Moosehead Breweries;Clear golden with a thin white head, low carbonation. Mild flavours of malt and a very distant bitterness. After all, it is merely a Pale Lager with a Little taste. Far from a Pale Ale proper.

Carta Blanca;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);(12oz bottle - part of a Mexico mix 12-pack) AROMA: almost no aroma, faint wet/boiled green beans, touch of dairy and wet paper APPEARANCE: straw yellow, billowy white foam, clear TASTE: some malt and grain, bit sour mash,sweet/sour dairy, light amount of raisin and bran, some lager hops but minimal bitterness PALATE: light to light-medium body, tart, crisp with a little creaminess, refreshing OVERALL: after the almost nothing nose I was expecting a pretty wimpy beer, but an ok amount of flavor for a pale lager. sour and grain notes that give this beer enough flavor that you know it is beer, but still quite light and refreshing. I'm not very experienced with mexican beers, but this seems to be above average for a beer from mexico. Similar to Miller High Life?

Carta Blanca;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Bottiglia. Il gusto al naso propende per l'orzo. L'intensità olfattiva è un timido profumo e la maniera in cui permane è corta. Il cappello di schiuma ha una scarsa tenuta, praticamente minimal. La grandezza delle bollicine è medio-fine. Il liquido è di consistenza limpida e anche qui la grandezza delle bollicine è medio-fine. Il colore è giallo dorato brillante. Il corpo è scarno, non ha mordente: è acqua colorata di giallo. L'amaro è misurato. La forza gustativa è appena percepibile. La continuità gustativa è impercettibile. Le sensazioni boccali finali risultano di facile beva. In bocca arriva aroma di cereali, carta e gesso.

Pours ugly gold with a dusting of a head - looks flat and unappealing. Aroma is corn water, grasses, junk. Flavor is what you'd expect from a cheap lager: corn water, maybe some grasses, old malt. Very flat, low carbonation. Junk.
Carta Blanca;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);First off, my ratings is simply because I like it! I don't taste corn, big plus in my book. I a little biased on my opinion of Carta Blana as it's the first Mexican beer I ever drank, I lived in Monterrey MX for 3 months. Love the colour, no comment about looks or smell, it's a beer I really like, that being said, one will like it or one won't. No comment about the head or lacing, it's not what I care about.
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Sampled in a blind taste-test on 11/10/2019. Very little aroma. Maybe a hint of tobacco? Sparse head and zero lacing. Tasty! Wet leather, slightly metallic on the tongue. Slight carbonation. Great beer ice cold.
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);There are ‘amber’ elements to it, but in flavour terms they’re virtually nonexistent, and I’ve had darker Pales. Calling this Amber just because partly amber is like calling a steak vegetarian because it’s got seasoning on it
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Very average wide distribution beer. A go to when at a place with limited selection. About what can be expected from a mass production lager. Great compliment to fast Mexican food (here’s lookin at you Chipotle).
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Not terrible, offering up a decent amount of flavor for a Mexican Vienna lager (always seems a little weird writing that). Caramel, dough, and toasted grain are set against mild lemon and corn notes, with a biscuity finish dusted with floral bitterness. Considering the other draft choices at the local Mexican restaurant, I guess Dos Equis Amber wins by default.
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);7/5/19 With H&C at Amigos. Big dark and very bready. Way better and richer than expected. Love it!
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Glass on tap at Family Club at Grand Riviera Princess. Aroma: nutty, skunky, cat pee, old corn. App' amber orangeish, small off white head leaving ok lacing on this plastic glass. Taste and palate: light body, mineral, tasteless, subtle bitter finish. Overall: as expected it's pretty bad. At least it's a bit refreshing. Meh.
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Pobre de espuma pero, cuerpo refrescante y bonito color ámbar, una de mis favoritas comerciales en Mexico.
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Clear, orange-golden colored, medium off white head. Malty, some toasted notes, caramel, light herbal bitterness, dryish finish. Medium to light bodied, soft carbonation, bit oily.
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Apparently never rated prior. Amber pour. Tastes and smells of cardboard and grains and corn. Watery. Pale malt.
Dos Equis XX Ambar (Amber);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Backlog, Amber color from a bottle, notes are light cherry, toast, cereal, corn, and butt cheek juice. Light bodied and forgettable. Maybe a worse Yunegling, thats tough to do. Congrats

Dos Equis XX Special Lager;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);"[On tap at a Mexican restaurant in Fullerton, CA.] I was expecting the amber beer, but this turned up instead. A bland and insipid lager style beer - pale straw with a loose white head; cereal aroma; and a faint grassy bitterness - I won't make the same mistake again."
Dos Equis XX Special Lager;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Aside from the Mexico lager, I am more curious about the pronunciations of the beer, it’s silent S or stress s.
Dos Equis XX Special Lager;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);I love this beer. It's better than modelo but not better than modelo negro.
Dos Equis XX Special Lager;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);"Not terrible but not special either. It tastes like a slightly more flavorful American macro beer. Its great if you want a ""beat the heat"" beer, but if you are looking for a more interesting flavor, you won't find it here."
Dos Equis XX Special Lager;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Bottle in Mexican restaurant in Santa Fe. Served in salt rimmed mug with a lime. Lime and salt dominate. Ok for what it is

Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Just bought my first Care for under $40, and was Surprised with the Lovely Flavour , low in Gas, Goes down Easy, it has my Stamp of Approval, and trust me , I am a Beer Expert, and for the Price, you just cant beat it.
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Glimmers of a decent flavour are buried under standard pale-lageriness, and finding them is like trying to someone on a static-y radio, by a freeway, in a storm.
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Clean, crisp, slightly sweet taste. Foamy head dies quickly but the easy drinking taste remains. I like this as my favourite Mexican beer. Low ABV makes it a good choice for hot summer days and nights. I like it!
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Mexico beer. Apartment officer Miggy referred it to me said it is her favorite.
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);"Part of the ""lawn mower' beer quest - and, sometimes you have to make a choice among equals (Corona, Dos Equis, ets.) That said... Pours pale straw, fizzy white head. Definite grainy malt aroma. Starts of rounded, a bigger bready note in the middle and slight citrus and sweet malt finish. It works for the category, and is less skunky than some of its compesino."
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Pour gold with a white head. Aroma and taste of pale malt and light citrus hops.
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Can from beerwulf. Clear golden appearance with big bubbly white head. Aroma is malt and slightly fruity. Flavour is citrus, bitter and sweet.
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Can at some street taco joint in Puerto Escondido. Didn't see the appearance as I drank it from the can but it was probably fyne. Aroma same. Taste is a bit sweeter than most mex logger and a bit maltier. Some astringency and annoying fatty malt. Not a favorite but goes down easy.
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Fluffy white head left a cover on a pale blind, finely carbonated body. Grass, malt & fruit aroma. Medium bodied, soft over the tongue with a sharp tingly finish. Light malt, fruit juice cordial & apple tastes. It wet & it's cold......
Tecate;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Went to a July 4th daytime party. The irony was that there was a Mexican beer selection (Sol, Tecate, and Dos XX's). Already had tried Sol and the regular Dos XX, so figure I would sample Tecate and Dos XX Amber for the first time. Tecate was better than I expected. Mouthfeel fairly smooth for swill, and just below average all-around the board. I wouldn't see myself buying it, but ok enough to not turn down.
Tecate Light;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);16oz can, clear gold, white head. Corny nose, some grain, a little garbage. Flavor follows, corny, light bread, some garbage, some metal. Watery finish. Yep.
Tecate Light;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);For a light beer, it is very flavorful. Unlike other light beers, it has taste. Doesn’t feel like drinking water.

Tecate Light;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Draft at Secrets Aura Cozumel. Typical Caribbean pale lager. Mostly grain, some corn. Better with lime. At least the view is good
Tecate Light;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Can at some random hotel bar in Jalpan. Hay yellow liquid with small to medium white head. Somewhat grainy but easy going aroma with a tiny bit of dms. Easy drinking and non-offensive taste. Reasonably OK.
Tecate Light;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);"27th Feb 2019; 12 fl oz can, BB Sep 2019. Drank at my daughters place in California while I cooked the evening meal. Light golden body, white head that soon dissipated. The nose held a slight grainy aroma, some grainy notes in the weak and bland taste also. OK in a hot kitchen but not a beer I could recommend."

Noche Buena;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Brought back from Mexico by a friend who knows my appreciation of different beers, I am trying my first 12 oz bottle. I mostly prefer to drink Mexican beers in the bottle and that is happening now too. I do have to point out how attractive the bottle is, all gold foil and the red poinsettias on the labels. I take a whiff, sort of toasty and malty. The taste follows, grain, a light maltiness, water and a bit of sweetness. I insert a wedge of lime and now it is only better. Noche Buena lines up with Negra Modelo and to a lesser degree, Dos Equis Amber. Really decent.

Noche Buena;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);"De la macro cervecera Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma(MEX) actualmente propiedad de la transnacional Heineken esta cerveza estilo Bock de temporada invernal de nombre “Noche Buena"" para este 2016 vuelve con su contenido alcohólico de recetas anteriores y de nuevo como parte de la linea Bohemia de esta cervecera, el estilo es de fermentación Lager y originario de Alemania, tiene una gran gama de colores que van desde las Helles que tienen tonalidades dorado claras hasta las mas obscuras con tonalidades marrón. En apariencia es una cerveza de corona de espuma ligera y porosa, con perlas de pequeñas a medianas, retención baja, el color del líquido es de un tono cobrizo con destellos dorados, cuerpo ligero. En aroma están presentes notas a caramelo, grano, ligeramente tostada como a corteza de pan, ligeramente herbal, la intensidad es mediana y muy limpia característica indispensable en la fermentación lager. En sabor destaca de forma inicial el dulzor similar a el caramelo con ciertos toques a corteza de pan, posteriormente se presenta un carácter amargo que equilibra bastante bien, ligeramente floral al final, si bien es cierto que es una cerveza poco compleja tiene características bien atinadas al estilo y aunque el sabor es algo pasajero y fácil de decifrar sigue marcando el standar del estilo."

Superior Rubia / Original;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Aroma and flavor is malts, mild caramel and a smooth/slightly beery finish. Not bad, rather forgettable but that’s not necessarily bad, definitely not nasty.
Superior Rubia / Original;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Superior 4.6% has a thin, white head, a clear, straw appearance, with lots of fairly large white chunks, suspended, throughout. Lots of glass lacing left behind. The aroma is of a sharp spice note, of some sort and a strange green apple or grape skin smell. Taste is somewhat muted, but one will pick up that odd grape or apple thing. Mouthfeel is medium, and Superior Original finishes crisp and easy going. RJT
Superior Rubia / Original;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);355ml bottle riding the ferry from Playa del Carmen to Cozumel. Drank it from the bottle as it did its job an quenched my first and aided in cooling me down. Nose is crisp malt with light German hops. Flavour is also crisp malt with a light German hops influence. Its a maltier brew compared to other light watery classic Mexican type beers.
Sol (Mexico);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Like watching a dramatic car crash, this awe-inspiring beer manages to combine the gravel-like taste of a mass-produced session beer, with the sickly palate of a bad craft beer
Sol (Mexico);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Light, typical beer of this type. Hints of wheat and sweetness. Not much head to this one. It would be very refreshing on a hot summer day.

Sol (Mexico);Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);"They say this beer is similar with ""Corona"" and perhaps it is in some point.. But the difference to me is little noticeable and that make me angry when i ask to give me one ""Corona"" and say to me ""We don't have but we have Sol"".. Anyway this beer is ok.. You can drink it very easy in the summer with one lemon inside for sure.. Without lemon the problems starts.. Overall a safe choice.. Better than some ""Heineken"" or ""Abstel"".. And with the lemon all goes well"

Indio;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);Bottle at lunch. Never heard of it so I ordered one. Drank it out of the bottle with a lime so don’t know what it looked like. I do know that it was light and clean with a smooth finish. Better than most Mexican lagers. Would definitely drink again.
Indio;Monterrey/Orizaba, Mexico;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;FEMSA - Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma (Heineken);I’ve never tried Indio before, it appears to be in line with Dos Equis Amber instead of the multitude of Mexican pale lagers. Good start. I got a lone 12 oz bottle at the nearby HEB as best as I recall. A departure from my usual Mexican beer tasting format, this one is getting opened and poured into a small 10 oz beer glass. It delivers a surprisingly dark red-amber body with an unsurprising, very slim, light tan top. I lift for a sniff, bread with a caramel entry. The unadorned taste is grain, malt, water and toast. I add a squeeze of lime. Definitely an improvement. Same taste, just now with lime. Certainly I would drink again.

Golden bronze beer with medium carbonation and large foamy head. A little lacing. Nose is subdued dark caramel with a whiff of earthy sulpher. Flat mouthfeel, smooth texture.

Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;Pours dark and ruby with a beige head. Looks good. If I had one major criticism, it's that the head was quite thin and went flat fairly quickly. However, this can depend upon the glass and what you've had to eat, so it may vary depending upon factors. Can't smell much in this, but it's inoffensive. There's loads more in the taste department, however. It has burnt, chocolate notes, with a fairly powerful bitter finish. It won't be to everybody's liking, but it's a taste that grows on you the more you drink it. I rather enjoy it personally. Riggwelter probably isn't the best ale I've tasted, but it's a damn decent effort, and once your palate has acquired its flavour - especially that strong, bitter (though not unpleasant) after-finish - other beers can taste quite bland by comparison. With a good, commendable strength of 5.7% ABV, definitely worth a try if you haven't had it already.
Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;"clear chestnut tcolour with ruby hue, one inch of dense creamy beige-ish head; aroma of toast, dried cherry and some dried plum; taste of toasted rye bread, some roasted nuts, dried cherry and plum, as well as some dark chocolate; quite enjoyable"
Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;"Really rich strong dark beer that feels stronger then 5.7%. It tastes like a mix between a ""Porter"" and a ale with bitter fruit background....If you like dark ales this is a winner"
Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;Bottle - clear, dark amber/red. Thick off white creamy head. Pleasant malty aroma. Ok mouthfeel. Malty caramel tasting - lasting finish.
Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;Alluring malty aroma in a red brown pour. Tasty hop malt balance tends to the latter with a hint of caramel in the body and finish. Makes a nice change from the usual hop bomb IPA.
Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;Bottle from Morrisons. Clear amber/ruby body with a tight off-white head. Steady carbonation.

Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;Clear dark brown, with a small head that doesn't last long. The nose is profoundly malty, with bread, dates, plum, caramel and whiskey. There is very little sweetness on the tongue - this beer is dry and fairly bitter. My only (minor) gripe is a slightly too sour finish. I would certainly buy this one again.
Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;"Auf dem Etikett kommt die Erklärung für den Namen: ""Wenn ein Schaf auf dem Rücken liegt und nicht mehr aus eigener Kraft aufstehen kann, dann sagt man im lokalen Dialekt, dass es ""rigged"" bzw. ""riggwelted"" ist."" Das Bier hat den World beer award UK 2016 gewonnen und wenn man es kostet versteht man warum. Es ist eine feine Kombination an Röst- und Kakaoaromen und ist gleichzeitig interessant anders und trotzdem gut süffig."
Black Sheep Riggwelter (Bottle);Masham, North Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Black Sheep Brewery;Pretty good strong ale. Light on the tongue, dark in character. A little chocolate, a little fruit, and a mild grassy hop afterburn. Tried at Anouk's b-day party in 2018.

Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Hi percentage alcohol, nice taste maybe just a tad over carbonated but goes down well. Very nice
Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Definitely a light, mass-produced, underwhelming beer (I hope I’m not offending any brew-bots there), but it at least remains comfortably within the ‘drinkable’ column, unlike the Bud Lights of this world. If it were a comedy film, yes it would feature Adam Sandler, but at least it would be one of his early films.
Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);0.710l can. Clear golden color with surprisingly nice looking white head. Aroma of malt, grain, corn and hops. Taste is sweet and little bitter. Unexpectedly not bad.
Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"This beer reminds me of the Titanic - big, bold, smooth.. and extremely sinkable ! Put a hole in it.. she goes straight down! It has everything you could possibly want from a beer.. or life in general. Crisp Cardboard. Sweet Hops. this beer is best paired with more Canadian Molson. On the 10th day of ascension.. Jesus Christ split bread and handed out tins to those gathered on Mount Molson. ""drink yee thy Canadian goodness"". every time I finish a can, I cry."
Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);355ml can (random supermarket, Toronto). Straight from the can as street-tick. Sweet, corn syrup, cardboard in aroma/taste. Nope!
Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle from Rehills, Newcastle. Pale golden coloured with a thick white head. Toffee, corn and slight grassy flavours are followed by a thin malty finish. Poor for the ABV.
Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bière en canette métal commandée dans l'avion vers le Canada. Nez inexistant, bouche idem, tout juste une pils façon 1664. Espérons que le Canada me réserve de meilleures découvertes !
Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It pours a yellow color , aroma of malt with some citrus notes , sweet taste , some spicyness , a little watery. Drinkable , but not enjoyable, there are a lot of better cheap lagers.
Molson Canadian;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This taste like Coors Banquet and could very well come out of the same tanks but it is more expensive so I don't buy it very often.
Molson Canadian Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12 oz, bottle picked up in Kentucky, from notes. Pours a clear, golden yellow color with a large fluffy white head. The aroma and flavor have sweet corn and other grains, lightly toasted, light grassy. Light body and fizzy carbonation. Not the worst, but...

Molson Canadian Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Pours clear pale straw with a fluffy two finger white head diminishing gradually to a thick cap, moderate lacing. (3/5) Nose is grainy corn and rice adjunct flavours, faint weedy grassy hops. (2/10) Taste is light sweet, minimal bitter. (2/10) Light watery body, fizzy to moderate carbonation, short dry finish. (2/5) Not even ""free"" makes this drinkable. But, a tick is a tick. (5/20)"
Molson Canadian Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Uh...after hockey beer stolen to take home to analyze. Here goes. It was always poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a super light yellow color with a quickly dissipating less than a one finger white foamy head. The lacing that was there quickly slid into the beer. The smell had a slight cooked corn/roasted/burnt rice about it. The taste, basically had the same flavoring. The palate, well, it sat fairly light with a decent sessionable quality about it. Overall, well, its an AAL/pale lager. Worthy of having again? Uh...maybe, but not really one to seek out for the post part.
Molson Canadian Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);It’s ok I suppose, if you want a light beer. Average color and taste. Heavy for a light beer. The regular is much better.
Molson Canadian Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can at the in-laws. Pale yellow, small white head. Watery grass and grains, metallic lager tones. Generally yuck.

Molson Canadian Light;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle. Not a good example of a light beer. Watery and tasteless and only drinkable when so cold you cant taste it.
Molson Canadian Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);rating a long lost tick. i dont remember much about this one. wasnt bad. wasnt great either??. looks kinda neat
Molson Canadian Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Oh geez, found another one, well here goes. It was poured into pilsener glasses and pint glasses and honestly there wasn’t much difference in either one. The appearance was a super light yellow to orange color with a quickly dissipating foamy white head that left no lacing. The smell had a semi-decent cooked corn/roasted barley aroma. The taste was mostly sweet through the previously mentioned flavors. The palate sat exceptionally light and sessionable. Overall, just another AAL that I would only have again if offered.
Molson Canadian Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a medium golden with a small head. Aroma of corn, grains, and sweetness. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is pretty boring.
Molson Canadian Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);355ml can from Depot before they delisted. Basically same grassy corny aroma and colour as canadian, maybe a hint of alcohol on the nose. Alcohol comes out in the palate, even at 5.5%. Uninteresting.
Molson Canadian Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz bottle. Pours a light yellow color with small fizzy white head. Aromas of light malt and some corn. Flavor is the same.

Molson Canadian Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle At the local golf tournament. Good god, really? How is this different from regular canadian?! Its the same pale listless, tasteless, fizzy water. Corny, watery, and bland. Its good whe you are parched after shooting 18, othrr then that..... Meh.
Molson Canadian Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);An ice cold blast of watery beer, that’s as cold as the Canadian Rockies. If only they put blue mountains on these suckers!
Molson Canadian Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"My wife and I drove up to BC from Portland to visit her god parents, this was my first time meeting them. Her Hungarian god father offers me a beer, I decline as I’m tired from the 6 hour drive and it is late. He insists and I finally agree figuring he wants one, saying ""I’ll have one if you do"". Well he returns with a Molson ice for me and a Diet Pepsi for himself. All said and done the Diet Pepsi was probably closer to beer than the Molson Ice!"
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Flavor is like bread and corn. Less bitter, less sweet, medium body. Balanced and simple beer for me.
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Aroma is caramel, honey and adjunct. Taste is light sweet malts, dry grain and corn. Pretty shallow and one dimensional.
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can. Pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a small white head. Has a fruity malty grainy aroma. Fruity malty grainy bitter flavor. Has a fruity malty grainy bitter finish.
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);500ml can purchased at Place Bell Arena in Laval, Quebec enjoyed during the LCD Soundsystem concert. The pour is clear golden yellow with carbonation bubbles. The aroma is grainy malt, a bit of generic sweetness. The taste is cereal grain malt, mildly artificial sweetness that has an odd bite to it. As the beer warmed, bit of a watery character. The palate is highly carbonated, light to medium bodied with a sweet watery finish. Small step up from macro lager.
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours a fair size frothy off-white head and has a pale straw coloured appearance. Heavily carbonated. Aromas are mostly wheaty and grainy malts. Faint earthy, grassy hops. Light citrus flavours, grainy malts, wheats. Slightly sweet and bitter but not too offensive. Slight astringent sensation, medium bodied. Slick drying mouthfeel. A good go-to beer. Pretty average but really good for a mass produced ale. Much better than you would expect.
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Draft @Normandin in rdl A: light cereal, macro like aroma, hint of corn syrup. App : clear pale with smallish white head. T/p: light to med body with short bitter finish. Soft to moderate carbonation. O: I feel like I’m 15 again. No such interest in this else than its rather blend but kind of fine thirst quencher.
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A classic, a reference for me as one of the most common beer with which I grew up. No match for most microbrews. Got this one as a treat after baseball from a team mate.
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Deep yellow gold color. Sweet malt nose with a touch of fruitiness. Good sweet malt flavor has a light graininess. Good hop balance.
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Enjoyable taste of malt, alcohol and sweet grains. Just a subtle amount of hops. Slight caramel taste. Medium/low carbonation. Fresh subtle finish. Very drinkable. This beer is made since 1903 and I feel that’s how a real beer without an overdose of hops and spices should taste like. This is an ale (macro) and it tastes much better than most of the macro lagers which taste basically nothing. I’ve tested a lot of macro beer, and this beer as a distinctive, much stronger taste (of malt, alcohol and grain) than other beer without being overloaded with hops and other spices like many craft beers. I like to mix it (in the fridge) with Labatt 50. Labatt 50 being another traditional macro ale with a long history, weaker malt taste and more of a fruity taste. The Molson Export as a distinctive taste which elevates it above most of the macro beers out there. 18/20
Molson Export;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Aroma and flavor is mild malts, a mild hint of hops and no finish/therefore smooth.
Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours dull yellow with tiny white head that goes away fast without leaving any lacing behind. Low carbonation. Aroma of corn syrup. Plesant dry finish to it. Medium body.

Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ceci a été une des premières bières que j'ai bu dans ma jeunesse. Après l'avoir essayé dernièrement, j'ai de la difficulté à comprendre comment j'ai pu en boire plusieurs. Je trouve qu'elle manque de goût et je préfère l'eau à ce liquide.
Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);33 cl bottle. Pours pale golden, clear, with a white head. Aroma is boozy: juniper, gooseberry, booze. Taste is dry, medium-bodied, short-lingering. Bah.
Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Late bloomer to beer drinking but my tastes have changed and with so many different ones to try I’ve been doing some sampling. Basically I’m looking for a few different types of beer to treat myself with and call them my “go to’s”. I’ve found that I enjoy something that has a standard to light initial taste, little to no after taste and not sit like a bowling ball in my stomach. I’m no expert on tastes and what have you, but I don’t need to be to know what I like, and if we have similar tastes then I hope you find this helpful. I am very surprised by this beer. I say that knowing going into this that it’s a “value” type of beer. It needs to be ice cold to enjoy it to the fullest. Moderate initial lager taste with a mild to low after taste. I think this is where the “paleness” of this beer helps the 5.5% alcohol content. It’s an easier stronger beer to drink. A little on the gassy side but had no problems burping it up. No bloating and I have a bit of a troubled tummy in the first place, so that’s a thumbs up. Overall, this guy doesn’t get a podium position for me... not even close really. But not bad, it has a place in my top 10 at least. Would drink again.
Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Pale yellow gold color. Creamy white head. Faint tart malt aroma. bittersweet malt flavor has light bitter hops. Light dry finish
Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ma biere de jeunesse. Bonne petite bière mais qui ne fait plus le poids contre les micros.
Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ce cher Pinker n’avait pas tort lorsqu’il affirmait haut et fort que cette bière était une anti-bière (Maïs et maltose au nez) sauf qu’on ne l’écoutait pas vraiment parce qu’il avait une réputation de prétentieux, il nous reprenait sur la prononciation de Bach et pourquoi les gens de Ville Mont-Royal disaient qu’ils habitaient TMR. Il n’avait pas beaucoup de modestie (saveurs sucrées et légèrement maltées) Bref, ce n’était pas une mauvaise personne pour autant, mais il a perdu des plumes lorsqu’il s’est mis à pleurer comme une fillette après s’être fait prendre à voler un pédalier Campagnolo. Nous sommes en 1989 ou 90 et cette bière me rappelle cette époque. (Ça se boit comme un rien cette bière) (1996-101016)
Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Fizzy yellow pour, head lasts 2 seconds longer than its bretheren. Grainy, light sulphur in the aroma - odd. Less on the sweet side, very light corn, grainy. Light body and higher carbonation. For a macro beer you could do far worse I guess.
Molson Dry;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can at YYZ lounge. Was hoping for something different than standard Molson. Pretty similar but more bitter, less sweet.
Molson Diamond;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);For a brief micro second this gave some head though that quickly disappeared. Slickly acidic there’s a faint smell of compost with an off bioled swede smell at the end. Not for me. Or anyone else that matter needing liquid refreshment.
Molson Diamond;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle. Yellow with small white head. Flavour is malt, maize, little sweet, dry and artificial.
Molson Diamond;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle courtesy? Hansen. Frothy white good mostly lasting head. Yellow colour. Extraordinary bad rotten aroma. Really foul bready flavor. No hopps or malts present. Bad finish. Very watery palate. Ugly stuff.

Molson Diamond;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Light yellow and clear. Has a white head, diminishing. Bad aroma, sharp, overcooked vegetables. Flavor is sweet and fatty, notes of artificial malt, syrup. Faint bitter finish. Watery texture and lively carbonation.
Molson Diamond;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Could not tell the difference between all the molsons. Did a blind taste test and could not detect any differences.
Molson Diamond;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Somewhere between a light beer and a de-alcoholized. For those who cannot decide if they thier DWI really counted. Doesn''t taste of much other than water.
Molson Diamond;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Very similar to Molson Golden. The Molson Golden is slightly above par, though.
Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Belle couleur, par contre odeur d'oignon, goût ok au début, mais par la suite on goûte trop de sucre, laisse un arrière goût et la bouche pateuse.

Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Elle est blonde. Sa mousse se résume à un mince voile.

Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Well I decided to go light for a bit and what better way than to sample some non alcoholic brews. Only case at the grocery store left was this stuff. Surprisingly it is ok; I was expecting to be horrid. Clear straw color, little CO2 head dissipates quickly. Light on the hops, has grassy notes, very thin, some maltiness to it. For a thirst quench and beer without kick, its ok."
Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Sip from my a Dad's, sweet grainy malts that as he said tastes like a regular beer.

Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Version canette...Ça sent l’orge, le miel et le maïs. Le goût est pas si mal au début mais quand le maïs sucré embarque, je décroche...
Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);[7379-20150711] Can. Skunky sweet straw base aroma. Clear, yellow body with a quick bubbly white head. More straw grains and grass in the flavour with a skunky undertone. Light-medium body. Poor. (3/2/3/2/7) 1.7 (c/o tuqueboy)
Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"My second Low Alcohol rate, these beers are interesting in their own right since you don’t have alcohol potentially skewing the rating and I find these don’t taste as bad as some people say. Can to pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold with a bright white head which fades to a modest top that leaves some lacing. Aroma is biscuit, fresh malt, crackers, and some cut grass but has an odd buttery smell as well. It almost smells like wort in a mash tun. Taste is cereal/malty with a pinch of sour/bitter leading to a grassy finish. The hops are well in the background; the beer is more malt forward. Palate is very thin and watery and the CO2 doesn’t stick around long. It is quite thirst quenching though. Overall this is surprising coming from Molson, but compared to the President’s Choice Blonde Brew, this isn’t as good. I think the beer needs more hop flavour."
Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ive tried quiet a few non alcoholic beers...and moslons has it right...besides i grew up on molson flavour and like a good wine or wiskey...it suits the pallet well...... It has its place in the beer line up....as well its easy on the pocket book !!!
Molson Exel;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);bright golden yellow with bubbly head. Grainy, lively scent with bready notes. flavor is well balanced yet aftertaste is a little sweet. Lively mf. its actually a good drink paired with food.
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Bottle at the Munschauer household in Buffalo. Pours clear golden; white head. Aroma is grain, malt, spices. Flavor is must, grain, hay, sweet malt. Not the best, but an institution? Perhaps."
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle in Toronto. Golden malt, some crisp bitterness. Mild hop character. Clean, nothing much happening.
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Nostalgia alone may not be enough for me to rate this as a good beer but definately a better all around north american ""table beer"" than Molson Canadian, bud or coors. The only put off in my mind is the metallic aftertaste, other than that it’s pretty solid and I can’t for the life of me figure out why they never market the stuff....the truest definition of ""Suds"" in"
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This was a pleasant surprise. A hint of sweetness and a sharp bit of herbal spice. Very easy to drink.
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pale golden pour. White head. The nose is lightly hoppy with some sweet graininess. Has a little bit of herbal hoppiness and a touch of sweetness. Okay really. For what it is.
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);bottle. Poured clear gold with not much of any head. Delicious bready malt aroma. Average carbonation, just a slightly chewy mouthfeel. Flavour of barley malt, a touch of citrus and grassy hop, finishes peppery with a medium dryness. A nice diamond in the rough in the the endless sea of macro brews.
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pale and light gold colour with little aroma. Taste is very light. Although probably one of the best current macros.
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341ml bottle. aroma of cooked veggies, cheap malts, and a whole lot of corn. good mouth feel, and good carb. the finish is corny, mealy, and wet almost mold grains. this is bad.
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);For many years as full as Molson beers got. Heavier and more bitter than most Molson products this is still underpowered and under performs. BIt to carbonic too though there is a bit of a messy bitterness there if you look.
Molson Stock Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle, sweet aroma and aroma. Pretty simple, better than most of theSe canadian macros. Reminds me of the pre-21 days and heading over to the Ontario bars
Molson Cream Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Sampled many years ago. Poured a pale golden amber color with a finger of white head with good retention that left some spotty lacing behind. Aroma was cereal grains with some light citrus and grass. Taste was a light citrus and grassy hop bitterness with a grainy malty sweetness. Light to medium in body with a creamy carbonation. Overall, this was a pretty solid brew from one of the big boys and too bad they could not continue this level of quality.
Molson Cream Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A decent looking beer that is the best from this brewery....................
Molson Cream Ale;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Cream Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);When fresh, this is actually a pretty good example of the style, and easily Molson's best beer. I'm not sure where they sell it these days.
Molson Spring Bock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally tried many years ago, poured a copper color with a finger or so of white head that settled quickly leaving only some spotted lacing on the glass. Aroma was of light chocolate and fruits with some grassy notes. Taste was a light chocolate malty sweetness with a grassy and spicy hop bitterness. Light to medium body with mild carbonation. Overall, this was one of the best brews that Molson ever made.
Molson Spring Bock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated in 2006. I remember buying this one a couple of times at the convenient store near here. For a Molson product, it was quite good. Had a good copper colour with an off-white head. Malty aroma with a fruity taste. Light roasted malt in the finish. I enjoyed this one... too bad they do not make this one anymore.
Molson Spring Bock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Aroma of malt and somewhat fruity. Dark copper colour with off-white head that recedes to ring. Fruity sweet malt flavour with a touch of roastiness (!) in the finish. Body is medium but carbonation is somewhat lifeless. Far better than I was expecting but not an exemplar of the style. Bottle.
Molson Spring Bock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);(Bottle) The bastards made me buy a six pack, Argh!!! I refused to buy any of their stuff but was pressured to compromise after I subjected them to Lucifer and that gave them the runs. I told them, “this beer is supposed to be enjoyed” but before I knew it all 8 of them were polished-off and the gang was acting stupid. Dave was the worst of them but that was okay, it was his house and he was one of the only married guys so the remainder of us let him off for ‘letting-loose’. I heard cannons firing in the toilette. A dog down the street was howling. And I heard the ‘psst’ of my Spring Bock release. God, I dread these moments – will I actually like the product of a macro? I have micro-snobed my way from pushing Moosehead to “Hey, try this.. its from Deutschland”. I’ve been beaten down, mainly by guys who think lagers and ales are a way to separate the beers in a two tap bar. God forbid I find myself there. But here I am now drinking Molson wondering how this copper bodied beer will fill my palate. Malty but lacking complexity… its been Molsonized!
Molson Spring Bock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Copper color, quickly dissipating head. Malty aroma, a bit fruity. Good malty body, pretty sweet and a hint of bitterness. Coming from Molson, it's a pretty decent beer.
Molson Spring Bock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Mixed feelings I have regarding Molson Bock. It is like they trying just can’t. It got what bock should have, it does have a decent body but the finish product is not best. It needs some bite, life
Molson Spring Bock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Scarce bead. Decent malt profile. Underflavored.............................
Molson Spring Bock;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Haven't seen this one in a while. I was never the most complex of beers, but it was a bock, with some malt character. A little overcarbonated, but that shouldn't surprise.
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle, golden color with medium white head. Notes are cereal, corn, lager, and skunk. Standard macro with an aggressive finish. Wouldn't need another
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Good beer overall. Bought some for my parents, better than Molson Canadian.
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Poured from 12 oz green bottle into pilsner glass A 1"" pillowy white head drops quickly with some mild lacing. Color is clear light gold with moderate streaming carbonation. Aroma of grain, a bit of skunk, and grassy hops. Mouthfeel is thin and watery with an easy finish. Flavor lightly toasted malt and distinct grassy hops. Overall it is a decent brew -- taste a bit like a Cream Ale (probably as a result of being an Ale-Lager hybrid)."
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);My favorite Canadian beer. Good stuff. I always have some around. Very smooth and easy drinking. Refreshing. Cheers.
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Brilliant clear golden with a thin foamy spotty top. Semisweet pale lagery aroma of light grains and light cereal and light corn with a slight grassy bite. Crisp semidry flavor that’s got little nuances of corn and pale cereal grain and a mellow lagery biscuity palate. Nice and crisp with a very subtle grassy hop undertone. Not shabby.
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);hey this is pretty decent for the price. smooth and simple and some flavor. id say its worth getting for what it is.
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I poured it from the bottle into a pint glass. It pours golden with a foamy, white head. The aroma was skunky grain. The taste was corn, cereal, and skunky bitterness. This didn’t taste very good and smelled even worse. I wouldn’t get this again.
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Light gold color with a big foamy white head.

Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Smell of straw, funk. Tastes of malt, straw, funk. Smooth drinking. Not a bad beer.
Molson Golden;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I got this from Friar Tucks. Pours gold with a white head. Taste grain, corn, mild funky. I thought this was ok. I could drink this again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Rickard's Red;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can. Clear amber color poured with a thin white head. The aroma is metalic with notes of caramel in the flavor as well. The taste is mildly sweet. The mouthfeel is thin and watery. If not for the metalic notes this could be a nice red ale.

Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);First beer I drank on a regular basis. The most popular beers then were O'keefe, Export and 50. This was the best of the 3.
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);From old tasting notes. Clear deep gold color has a foamy white head. Slightly fruity malt aroma. Sweet, tart flavor upfront. Dry middle. Bitter hop finish is light.
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours a clear golden with a medium white head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is of corn, light grass and sweetish cereals. Taste is of lightly sweet cereals again and not really bitter. Body is medium, carbonation moderate. Not bad at all, I’m totally getting the golden ale from this.
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);The best way I can describe this beer is ’cereal milk’ It’s got very little aroma & looks like wee. The taste is very sweet but pleasant. It feels almost creamy in the mouth. Actually, not creamy. Skimmed milky. Like the ghost of creamy. It’s mildly hoppy, not bitter as such but not at all sickly sweet either. It has obvious honey notes with orange tones & a few herbs. Overall, it’s a very easy drink. Goes down smooth & doesn’t leave any residual gassiness or unpleasant after taste.
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);341ml bottle. Clear pale yellow with a thin white head. Flavors are corn syrup, cardboard and sugar with fruity and vegetal notes. Light to medium body, lively carbonation, smooth texture.
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Tant qu’à être à ’taverne, allons-y pour sa rivale de l’époque. La bière qui divisait notre bon ami Steeve et moi-même, à l’époque ou je vantais la 50. Elle est encore plus pâle , mais une dentelle se dessine (Nothing else matters de Metallica dans les oreilles) Malt et sirop de maïs au nez avec ici aussi, un côté métallique. Un goût insipide où on arrive à détecter des pointes herbacées. Bizarrement, on a l’impression qu’elle nous bourre l’estomac. J’en ai mal au ventre. (Bon, là c’est la chanson Macho Man qui crache dans les haut-parleurs) (840-031013)
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle: &nbsp Thanks to Shaughn O’Keefe for his namesake of a beer! &nbsp Piss like clarity, little head, wow, make that NO head nor lacing. &nbsp Smells like water. &nbsp Wow, if this is a Golden/Blonde, its one of the lightest I have ever had. &nbsp Holy Schnikes! &nbsp Thankfully its not grainy, and what is there is just a slight sweet grassy sort of malty/mealy flavor. &nbsp While I find nothing really off with this one, it doesn’t have much to offer. &nbps Really light and boring. &nbsp A true lawnmower beer. &nbsp This deserves better than a 1 percentile... perhaps a 2?
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bouteille 341ml. Couleur jaune pâle, peu de mousse blanche. Arôme de malt léger. Goût de malt léger, pratiquement rien d’autres. Carbonation moyenne, un peu aqueuse. Bof...
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);710 ml bottle. Pours a clear straw with a short lasting white head, no lacing. Taste is cereal, corn syrup, nothing very interesting. Dry, herbal finish. Light bodied, watery mouthfeel. Weak carbonation. Cheap.
Molson O'Keefe;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated December 2005. Holy smacks ! I thought this one was long gone. I thought it was now the Old Vienna. Then, in a pizza store in Montreal, I see it. Finally, I have found it here, in Gatineau, Quebec. It does list on the label that it is 5% ABV. Pours a golden colour with a good foamy-cream head with heavy retention and nice lacing. The aromas are of malt and alcohol. Watery mouthfeel, quite crisp. The taste is malty and bitter with grain and slight corn finish. A decent ale that is refreshing with a bitter edge and malt winning over corn. The original brewery (O’Keefe) used to have a big share in the Quebec Nordiques... my favorite team. Bring ’em back !
Molson Black Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Good old malt liquer. Pours colour of piss with small head that goes away quickly. Heavy taste of malt. Sweet finish.
Molson Black Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Best drank warm while enjoying your scenic waterfront view from under a brigde. Aroma reminds me of a future in which I will be hating my current self. Pair with panhandling and desperation to really bring out the earthy undertones, which may just dirty hands. Colour of your urine on the side of city hall. Pleasant head.
Molson Black Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);710ml can. This is an ice melt liquor that actually is OK by the end of the can.Its a bit off putting qand boozy at first but as you go just you typical Molson ~6% ICER.
Molson Black Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);The second in my lineup of Stanley cup final malt liquors is a massive molson can. Oooh, 6.1% alcohol!! You mean, like, a lot less than your average craft IPA? Do you dare, Molson’s, to try something to so complex?? Has decent head at least and well carbonated yellow body. Aroma is wet hops and cardboard. Flavour is murky malts with just a hint of fusel alcohol. Slightly watery finish. This is bad but comes off as a godsend after that Coors Altitude crap - it just reminded me how really bad it is.
Molson Black Ice;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Malt Liquor;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);drank from a bottle a long time ago..don’t remember details but never had a desire to try it again.

Asahi Super Dry;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;Aroma of lemongrass, citrus and banana. Slim malt taste, rice and corn starch makes this hardly a beer, but it is drinkable due to dry hoppy finish
Asahi Super Dry;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;A crisp and aromatic lager, dry yet refreshing and slightly fruity. Tarte and vibrant when first sipped, with the taste becoming softer and more refreshing as it sits on the tongue. An easy drink, though perhaps slightly too sweet.
Asahi Super Dry;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;Bottle @Home, vintage 1999!. A hint of grass, other than that, it has aged incredibly well and tastes nothing.
Asahi Super Dry;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;Simple beer, the Japanese version tastes a bit different. It has that bitterness and simple beer taste. Nothing too strong or sweet.
Asahi Super Dry;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;"To be honest i expecting some more things from this beer despite is an ""Ok"" beer overall.. First of all you must have back in your mind what you want from some beers.. This beer has one style and it means ""must be one light and refreshing beer"".. And like that you must judge the beers i think.. Anyway the aroma remind me very hard ""Heineken"" and that wasen't good sign but the taste was little different and that save the whole thing.. I see outside some badass japanese writings and you can't imagine this beer can be in the same level like the ""Heineken"" and ""Amstel.. The taste is little sour and very bitter and i'm not fan for that but in this specific case the taste wasen't so bad.. Is really dry beer and that perhaps make it little more unique for some others similar beers.. The beer punch you little more than usual and this difference matters for me.. She say you ""i'm here"" in every draught.. And when it become little more warmer still this beer is punchy in your palate.. Also i feel some rice here and the aftertaste is little metallic but don't affect me so much that.. I enjoy the aftertaste.. Overall is a decent and refreshing lager.. Is not one pleasand and sweet beer.. Is really dry and punchy and that make it more unique for me.. I really enjoy this beer despite i expecting some more things.."

Labatt Blue;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours a clear yellow with a full white head that reduces unlike the Light version. Leaves lacing.

Taste is malt with attenuated sweetness. Body is full. Aftertaste is mildly bitter. This rated less than Light because it claims more and delivers less. 25 oz can Packaged 6/15/19

Light herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with no fruity/yeasty notes. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness/carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. A bit thin, but not watery finish. Very slight increasing lingering warmth of 5.6%. Overall this is a very solid pale adjunct lager. All around good robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink for the ABV. Definitely a bit more flavorful than the base beer as expected. Clean pale malt/grains and solid earthy hop presence for the style. Solid barley presence, not too heavy on the corn. An enjoyable and well made offering."

John Labatt Classic Wheat;London, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);I remember drinking this back in around 97 or 98, Golden beer with a wheat and slightly bitter taste.
John Labatt Classic Wheat;London, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);12oz - Bought a couple of cases of this back in ’97, and it disappeared quickly. A solid beer, dark gold with a strong malt backbone. Disappeared after that, replaced by the Classic.

John Labatt Classic Wheat;London, Ontario, Canada;Wheat Ale;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Wheat beers give me headaches. That aside, this was not the worst one I have ever had. A Canadian friend brought this stuff on one of his visits, and I'm sure the Canadians thanked him for taking it away from their country.

Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Classic, standard beer, with a hint of excitement at the end. It’s like when a pub cover band takes a break from Bon Jovi covers to ‘liven it up’ with some Brian Adams at the end of their set.
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Was expecting more hops but it was surprisingly easy to drink. Light body but low head retention.
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Best beer in the world. Totally. Dominant hop flavour and aroma, just like the cat on the can, just look at that bad ass being all dominant and shit with those trees and mountains in the back ground. I’ll bet the cat is like a rock too, he’s standing on one, what a bad ass. This beer sucks. But I’m broke and it’s 6.1% so my expectations weren’t high but it’s not terrible by any means, there’s just better out there.
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Can @ AirBNB Arts Colony. Pale straw yellow...not much in the way of head retention. Sweet corn syrup and grape juice. Green apple candies, some Jolly Rancher, and pennies. Flavor has a harsh metallic taste and a lot of green apple. Sweet, syrupy fruit ""juice"" and corn. Grainy. Not horrible/offensive, but not good."
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Those is a light easy to drink beer that is higher in alcohol. Usually I find the higher alcohol content beers hoppy tasting.
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"The local’s inform me this is known colloquially as ""shitty kitty"". Can’t remember why I bought it. But I did, and I drank it. Brown, no head, flat flavour. Dank chemical brew"
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Not very strong bro. Piss yellow pour with minimal head. Cheap lager aroma, lots of green apple, a bit of earth. Just not good, too full of a body. Meh.
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);355 ml can, impulse buy at the till from the singles bin @ Jimmys Liquor. Clear pale yellow, feeble foamy white head. Bland grainy corny malt liquor-ish aroma and taste. Average carbonation, light bodied, low hopped. This value priced, alcohol infused industrial swill is very popular with the local ranchers. LGH (Let’s Get Hosed)
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);341ml bottle pours a pale straw color with a 2 finger white head that settles quickly leaving no lace behind. Aroma is cheap grains and hops. Taste is light malt sweetness and cheap hop bitterness which leaves little to be desired. Cheap price, cheap quality beer.
Labatt Wildcat Strong;London, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);341 ml bottle. Pours a clear yellow gold with lots of big fizz and a small and quickly disappearing white head. Nose of alcohol and sweet grains. Taste follows. Thin and overcarbonated. Very bad but not entirely disgusting.
Labatt Genuine;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"355 ml can from a six-pack from Liquor Depot, served in a lager pint glass. Pours a clear, medium golden color, lightly carbonated with large bubbles, with a puffy white head that lingers longer than most, leaving a ring of lace. Aroma is, thankfully, more malt than corn, light and mildly sweet. Flavor is very thin and watery, reminiscent of a cerveza or Tsingtao, with the light sweetness of malts, rice, and, thankfully again, very light on the corniness. I detect a hint of metallic taste as well. Clean finish, although without the bitter crispness a good lager delivers; the palate and mouthfeel is watery, and the initial carbonation peters out quickly with a whimper. Nevertheless, I find nothing noxious about it; if served on tap, the extra CO2 would push my rating up a point or three. It’s anemic but palatable, yet still overpriced for what you get; it would be a fine dollar beer if adjusted, good for mowing grass or sessioning on hot days. Some may even appreciate the non-carbonation - this is unlikely to raise more than a modest ""urp""."
Labatt Genuine;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);355ml bottle. Clear, golden pour, corny aroma, vegetal, slight grains. Meh. Boring macro lager.
Labatt Genuine;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);355ml can pours a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves no lacing behind. Aroma is light grains and hops. Taste is slightly metallic with light malts and an undesirable hop bitterness that lingers. Slightly below average for this style.
Labatt Genuine;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours a bright golden color with some head. There aren’t a tonne of differences between this beer and Labatt Blue. Some hoppy bitternes. Not good.
Labatt Genuine;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Originally rated December 2005. This beer is best drunk from the bottle (review is from glass though). Pours a straw yellow colour with a small head and no retention, nor lacing. The nose is sweet with malt. Flat mouthfeel, with the taste of corn all over. Just too light though. Not like corn at its greatest, just watered down corn. Stick to Miller High Life... and no where near Miller’s Genuine Draft.
Labatt Genuine;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);A bit hoppy and golden in color. A decent pale lager with a lite bitter flavor. It had been a while, but I enjoyed it.
Labatt Genuine;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"341 mL Bottle. Straw body with a small white head dissipating to a thin foamy ring with some spotty lace. Aroma of cereal grains and Corn Flakes, a hint of earth and a chemical harshness to it. It tastes like a liquid combination of Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies with intense sweet corn accentuating the blandness. Sweet corn speaks up most strongly in the aftertaste; corn husk finish tapers off cleanly, making it the only attribute for which this beer can score a bonus point in Overall. 150 years of brewing tradition, eh!"
Labatt Genuine;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pours golden yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is very dull and slightly sweet.

Tom Wood's Harvest Bitter;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);Bottle. It pours a small, white head over a clear, golden body. At first the aroma seems to be a blend of toffee and fruityness, but it turns out to be close to hens droppings. Still not all bad. The flavor too has a strange touch of something I really can’t identify, with caramel and fruityness in the back. Medium body. Almost smoked in the end, but I can’t say I appreciate it in any way. Not my beverage. 111126

King and Barnes Festive;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);First tasted this in Blackfriers, Glasgow in January 1991. Cask, handpump dispense. Dark ruby in colour with a thick creamy white head. Strong vinous aroma of plums, black grapes and floral dusty hops. Smooth creamy texture to the mouthfeel and superb lacing. Complex mixed malts give a strong robust maltloaf base with rich banoffee pie notes which pave the way to sun dried apricots and sultanas. Dusty hop resins give an earthy, almost yeasty bread flavour to the long aftertaste. Complexity continues into the finish with strong malt present in overipe banana and butterscotch notes which intensify into warming alcoholic port and oak cask notes. A wonderful example of an English Strong Ale, crafted with traditional skill and producing an array of complex flavours. A cracking beer and sadly missed.
King and Barnes Festive;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);This beer was stale dated when I had it. All I was notes of cardboard and malt. Bought this a Topper’s Helena Montana about 5 years ago. Page 258 of Michael Jackson’s Great Beer Guide only 352 out of his 500 Classic Brews to go.
King and Barnes Festive;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);’99 vintage drank better than the ’98 so I’m rating that one. Cloudy blondish brown in color. No head or lace. Sourness and carmel on the nose. Tartnes is the initial taste, then a nutty, carmelly sweetness comes through to balance, with a slight rhubarb on the finish. Better than I remember tasting the last time.
King and Barnes Festive;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);"Vintage 1999 from the King & Barnes Brewery: Interesting yellow-red-brown color, and I was using natural lighting to look at it. Filmy white head. My note say ""edgelessly smooth,"" and I think I meant that this slightly thin beer had a blending of flavors that didn’t allow one to dominate. There’s a buttery, soft malt taste with a light nut bitterness and a hint of pome fruits. Not a very exciting strong ale. Christmas & Winter Beer Tasting at Delilah’s, Chicago, IL 12/10/2005"

Time to go brush my teeth...

King and Barnes Mild Ale;Oving, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Gribble Brewery;Cask (handpump). Old notes from circa 2000 (hence they relate to the original K & B brewed version) which I’m allowing myself as I’m not at all sure this beer is available any more. A quite red coloured milt with a watery body and a shortage of flavour. Tastes like the bitter with added caramel. A purely functional pour-it-down-yer-neck mild from the old school. I’m led to believe that the Gribble-brewed version is rather different, but I’ve never seen it, so can’t comment.

King and Barnes Mild Ale;Oving, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Gribble Brewery;Chappel Beer Fest, Gravity. Reddish black mild appearance - no head. Red grape aroma and blackcurrant.

King and Barnes Mild Ale;Oving, West Sussex, England;Mild Ale;Gribble Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Lovely dark brown ale with a clinging tan head.

King and Barnes Coppercast;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King and Barnes;The very essence of why I don't like King & Barnes's beers: Thin, sweet and not much flavour.
King and Barnes Cornucopia;Blandford Forum, Dorset, England;Strong Ale - English;Badger Brewery (Hall & Woodhouse);"(Bottle 50 cl) Normally corn isn’t really anything to take pride in for a brewer, but here this grain seems to be the focus point for ""Cornucopia"". Slightly hazy golden beer with a gigantic head that refuses to stay in the bottle. Spicy, herbal nose. Flavours contain the same characteristics with a less pleasant phenolic edge and a bitter finish. Quite extraordinary. 260102"
