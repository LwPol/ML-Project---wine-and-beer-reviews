Now, there is no reason to add this rating (retired) other than for my own list of “had it” beers. Sweet fruity in the nose and sweet fruity bitter in the taste.
Grolsch Finale;Boekelo, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Grolsche Bierbrouwerij Ned. (Asahi);Bottle 1,5 L, bottled in 1998 and cellared for 10 years. Bottle opens with a bang and some foam gushes out. This brew is still lively after all those years. Pours a cloudy orange with a small white head and a fruity, citrus-like and peppery aroma. The falvour is slightly sweet and fruity, with citrus and subtile spicey notes. A short, watered down, mostly spicey finish. Still a nice beer after all those years.

Grunn Winterbier;Groningen, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Groningse Bierbrouwerij;(Still brewed at Texelse bierbrouwerij) Light-brown head, quickly gone. Hazelnutbrown, hazy - yeast in suspension. Nose of roasted malt, chocolate & something sourish. Taste gives even more outspoken roasted malt, now with cigarash arome. Malty tones dominate, but they have the ring of quality malts. Little bitterness. There's no trace of the sourish nose or of the added spices. Surprisingly light bodied for a winterbeer, but it is not lacking. I can live with this. Aftertaste again some chocolate. A nice beer, not for the hopheads, however. If tasted blind, I would have guessed dark bock, rather than Belgian Strong.

Caiman;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);I normally like sweet things but this is way out of hand. Too artificial and fake. Ugly colour.
Caiman;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);The aroma is very sweet, dominated by caipirinha and with notes of malt. It has a golden color and a beutiful though collapsing head. The flavor is way too sweet and too dominated by caipirinha. It also has a lot of sour citrus to go with the sweetness. It ends on a slight but OK bitterness. It is light in the beginning but has an OK palate in the end. All in all it tastes artificial. Don't try it.
Caiman;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Lemon aroma. Sweet taste with lemon, glue and a bit of alcohol. Very artificial, but my 16 year old niece will love it.
Caiman;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Holsten-Brauerei (Carlsberg);The bottle says it's made with Caipirinha. This is a mixed drink with lime, sugar and Cachaca, a Brazilian Sugar Cane Brandy or Rum, I've seen it listed as both. In my defense, the only reason I'm subjecting myself to this is to get us to 100,000 ratings! Very fizzy like a 7-up. Smells rather nasty, chemical.

The flavour falls flat and the aroma isn't quite right. The price is good, however, and you can do far worse in terms of overall quality.
Leinenkugels Big Butt Doppelbock;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);bottle - Clear reddish-brown pour. The aroma is of toasted malt and caramel. The flavor is sweet with caramel and a touch of dark fruit. It's alright though not as robust as I expected from a doppelbock.
Leinenkugels Big Butt Doppelbock;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);"A good beer that has a great taste. Do they use GMO ingredients?? It appears they do - bummer. Also, this is a ""special edition"" offering, so, not likely to be around a lot. Too bad.......... rated at 3.8 Nice site, thanks for allowing beer lovers to post simple reviews and not have to rate according to the 50 ""accepted"" measures of a review (based on all sorts of odd characteristics of the beer) as is done by some sites that claim to be your ""advocate""."
Leinenkugels Big Butt Doppelbock;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Pours dark golden with substantial head. Aroma is wheat and light hops. Taste is acrid, odd for a doppelbock, building to some sweetness. Aftertaste is metallic that lingers. Not a good choice as a representative of doppelbocks.
Leinenkugels Big Butt Doppelbock;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Pours a dark reddish brown. Nice one and half finger khaki head. Pretty good retention, light lacing. Aroma is medium/dark roasted malts. Has cherries, raisins and other fruits like that. Also a touch of cocoa and caramel. Taste is almost exactly the same as the aroma. Nice dark roasted malt sweetness. Lots of dark fruits like cherries and raisins in the flavor. Good cocoa and caramel in there too. Mouthfeel is medium body. It’s very smooth, no bitterness at all, no alcohol taste. Perhaps a touch sour on the swallow. Overall, this is quite delicious. Wish it were higher ABV, but the flavor is very good. I would drink this again, and I also would recommend it. Yummy!
Leinenkugels Big Butt Doppelbock;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);bottle. Pours dark brown with an average beige head. Aroma of sweet toasted malts, caramel and light brown sugar. Flavor of toasted malts, caramel, subtle dark fruit, raisins and brown sugar.
Leinenkugels Big Butt Doppelbock;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);its good beer. some caramel and a substantial body with a bit of syrup. beery with a hint of hop and moderate malt perhaps liquid but good. nice cold on this hot afternoon the beer is satisfying. alcohol easy with the caramel.
Leinenkugels Big Butt Doppelbock;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Bottle from Albertsons. Decent looking pour, dark, clear brown with a soft foamy beige head. Sweet, nutty aroma and taste, but kind of watered down. Finishes sweet, like a root beer barrel candy, and painfully dry.
Leinenkugels Big Butt Doppelbock;Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Company (Tenth & Blake - Molson Coors);Color is like a melted ice coke. Also the taste isnt too far from a sweet watery cola. Deserves better than the low overall rating. Leinies are fine brews, hate that the big name brings then down from the beer snobs. Not my favorite style but there is absolutely nothing wrong with this very drinkable treat. Perfect for a sampler.
Theillier Biere Bock;Bavay, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Theillier;750ml bottle from the brewery in Bavay. Clear pale gold, still. Astoundingly awful nose of oxidized copper pennies and notebook paper pale malt. Sweet, lightly toasty in the mouth, watery and thin texture, though the carbonation is somewhat frothy. Lingering metallic finish. Not sure that the brewmaster Micheal knows what he is doing with this beer... I think it’s contracted for a few certain places, and he gave us bottles with somewhat of a grimace, a look to said we should not have high expectations. I admire his honesty.

Schäff-Bräu Altmühltaler Gold Export;Treuchtlingen, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Mittelbayerischer Getränkevertrieb / Schäffbräu (BHB);It’s yellow-golden with a creamy, white head.

Schäff-Bräu Altmühltaler Gold Export;Treuchtlingen, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Mittelbayerischer Getränkevertrieb / Schäffbräu (BHB);(Flasche) Optisch ist es ein dunkles, klares, gelbes Bier mit einer weißen Schaumkrone. Das Aroma ist süßlich mit einer leichten würzigen Hopfennote und minimalem DMS. Das Bier schmeckt nach fast nichts. Eine minimale Süße kommt erst nach ein paar Schlücken und da hängt schon eine unangenehme Bittere im Gaumen. Zusammengefasst ist es ein passables BilligBier.
Kelley Brothers Inferno Red;Manteca, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;Brown, malty, hoppy, piney, sweet, alcohol. Not a good red, I couldn’t finish a pint.
Kelley Brothers Inferno Red;Manteca, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;Hmmm. I think this one had more hop than their IPA! More brownish than red, it looks like it may have had a problem at the filtering stage. Drinkable when it’s cold, but when warming up a tad it was really rough going. I’d rate this one just slightly a notch above macro swill sold to the masses.
Kelley Brothers Inferno Red;Manteca, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;"The bottle says ""A Sandwich In Every Glass"", appearantly I got the grape skin with teabag sandwich. Hazy dark-brown in colour, thin tan head. Modest malt, sparse hops. Hopefully the sink will like this better than me."
Kelley Brothers Inferno Red;Manteca, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;Pours brown with big head on top. This was obviously meant to be a big bold ale... The problem is the balance is way off. Very sweet with a strong alcohol punch. Buts that’s about it- just sugar and alcohol.
Kelley Brothers Inferno Red;Manteca, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;When I had this I thought it was an IPA. It tastes like one that's for sure. The hops just jump out at you. It's not a red ale though. I didn't think it was too bad. It's very strong though.
Kelley Brothers Inferno Red;Manteca, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;Muddy brown color, small head. Malty and very hoppy. Muddy taste. Not sure what this stuff is, but it isn’t very good. Harsh tasting, overly hopped with not enough malts to balance them. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is harsh. Aftertaste is very bitter. Need to brush my teeth. Don’t know what’s worse, that I still have 5 bottles of this swill left, or I spent $7 for a sixer. They built this brewery in a old burnt out theater and I’m kind of hoping for another fire… Wish I had seen user_ex review BEFORE I bought this SWILL.
Kelley Brothers Inferno Red;Manteca, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;This is not red. It's a chocolatey brown cloudy liquid with a thin head. It smells nice though -- citic and bushy. The body is medium to heavy with light medium effervescence. After the the initial aroma the beer is muddy or dusty in scent. It's a hardy, well-hopped brew with only belches belying what must be Cascade hops. There is a very subtle wet cardboard and what would become a shoe smell.
Moonlight Dry Leaves Alt;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Moonlight Brewing Company (Heineken);Medium full roast and viney hop aroma but not a heckuva lot of it. Very bitter. Dark copper, slightly cloudy with not much head. Some tannin rasp and citric flavors.

Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Slightly sweet, malty and a bit of fruit too. Pleasant, not great. Copper pour, cream head.
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Cask at Travellers Rest, Cockerton as Tetleys Original Cask. Orangey golden colour, white foam head leaving some lacing and sour malty aroma. Taste is mash malty, toffee, grainy with some fruity bitterness. Light bodied, soft carbonation, dry mashy finish. OK
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Ligh amber color. Easy drinking with just enough malt sweetness and hops to go down easy.
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Cask. Fagan’s, Sheffield. Only called in here cos it’s pissing down with rain, and I needed a piss. I sort of did my beer drinking growing up on beer like Tetley’s. This ain’t that beer, but then I’m not that young. Oh, and by the way, what’s that fucken towel hung up in the bogs?
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Very well kept draft bitter at the student union in 1984. Not as much character as a pint of Marston’s Pedigree but a good session beer.
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Refreshing. Very smooth nitro head. Little carbonation, no sting. It?s like malty water. It?s very bland, but easy to drink. Caramel dominates, little hop flavours come through. Biscuity. Watery. Not as a good as it used to be, but it hasn’t ever been great.
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;May 2016 - Cask HP at The Bayswater Arms. As ’Tetleys’. Pale orange, clear, still, small off-white head doesn’t endure. Aroma has an initial touch of sulphur which dies down quickly. Then it’s sugary, flat cola. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is thin cracker malts, some white pepper, white bread, soft bitterness. Overall impression isn’t far off a flat lager. Glad to have tried this classic, as it’s one that I’ve heard many old-timers speak favourably of. Also glad that beer has moved on from this. (2.5)
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Tetleys at a good pump enhances a day out, won’t mangle your brain, is refreshing and drinkable. Ale heavies will scorn it, pompous nits, it is what it is, a clubhouse session bitter, good with sandwiches, pork scratchings, watching Leeds Utd. Creamy head that stays as Northerners like, adds to the pleasant mild malty biscuit. Quaff and quaff again, unfancy mass market aimed session bitter, does its modest job very well.
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Pours well enough to overly sweet very drinkable but bland with it typical macro stuff
Tetleys Cask Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Cask at New Inn, Great Preston. Pours caramel brown with an off white head. Watery, so so watery, biscuit finish. This is truly shocking, even worse than mass produced keg bitter.
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);A bog standard lager. A bit watery, too sweet. Warm too, which didn’t help but wouldn’t have been up to much anyway. Blegh.
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Aromas a caramelo y tofe. Mal aspecto sin espuma y con leva flotando. En boca empalagosa y nada balanceada
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Pint on-tap at Green Chilli Cafe, Glasgow (£3.80): Much better than expected but that’s not to say it was great beer, just that I was expecting worse. Starting with basic malts & the odd skunky flavour, it was drinkable & seemed to go well with my curry but had to be drunk fresh & cold as it faded the longer I left it sitting. There was some grassy touches & a light-bitter finish but in truth it was quite basic so it’s not one to go hunting for.
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Rated from historic notes, bottle at an Indian restaurant. Poured a pale gold colour with an average sized white head. Aroma was malty, touch of hop and caramel. Light bitterness and sweetness. Average carbonation. Not much to this really.
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);On tap at restaurant. Golden with white head. Smell is light grain and malt. Taste is light grain and bread. Dry with low bitterness and medium carbonation. A little watery.
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Pint kashmiri aroma, wakefield. Pale yellow with not much head. Aroma is nicely malty With A Little sweetcorn and some floral perfume. Taste is mild and crisp, slightly bitter on the finish. Watery but not too fizzy. Not much of a beer, but perfect for a curry.
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Hardly any aroma. Looks like a standard lager. Not bad. But any lager would be good with a curry right now ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);On draft at kushis, pours a clear full Golden with no head, aroma is cereal and light malts. Taste is not all that much light metallic taste, classic session able curry beer
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);330ml bottle pours a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves very little lacing on the glass. Aromas of grainy malts and mild hops. Taste is malty sweet with not quite enough hop bitterness for a proper balance of flavors. Only slightly better than a typical macro.
Lal Toofan;Mumbai, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shaw Wallace (AB InBev);Large bottle from some bargain store. Grainy aroma, pale urine yellow stale cardboardy taste, I guess it’s only a bargain if it’s drinkable which this was, just. I won’t go out of my way to repeat the experience though.
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;From old tasting notes. Bright brassy gold color. Small white head. Interesting white chocolate nose. Sweet white chocolate flavor dominates. Different.
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;This is a unique and interesting beer with chocolate flavors, herbs, and spice. It is a bit unusual in color and doesn’t have much of a head, but is a good dessert beer.
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;Pours gold with a nice white head. Smells of spice, dough, some wheat. Tastes of caramel, chocolate, lots of doughiness on the finish. I really hope this brewery isn’t gone for good. This is an interesting beer.
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;"Little bottle at Winking Lizard Tavern, Cleveland, OH. I had this years ago, but remember it quite well. It pours almost transparent and is exactly what you expect. It tastes like white chocolate; sweet, but 7oz doesn’t get cloying. But beer? More malt beverage than beer. A nice dessert, and nothing more."
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;Interesting aroma of chocolate, brown sugar. Appearance is pale golden, and murky. Vitrually no head at all. I have to wonder if it’s flat due to its age (this was purcahsed today, and the beer has been retired a while.) The taste is sweet, like chocolate pudding. Virtually no hops, or anything else. Palate is unremarkable. An ok beer, but I’m not sorry it’s retired. (And I’m pissed I paid $3.99 for it.)
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;(7oz bottle, courtesy of Sledge Jr) Pours a clear golden body with small white head. Looked like a lager, but this was far from the aroma and taste. Halloween reminiscent nose of tootsie roll, candy corn, and caramel. Flavor of white chocolate, malt, and loads of corn syrup once it warms up.... Very interesting, as my friend Tad would say.
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;16-Oct-06 (7 oz bottle: Purchased in Washington, DC sometime in 2000 or 2001) I bought this bottle of beer before I moved to San Diego in the summer of 2001, so this is some pretty damn old stuff. I didn’t intentionally try to age this beer six years, I just could never find a beer to pair with it for a rating session. Well, enough’s enough. The beer pours dark golden in color, fairly hazy in appearance, and capped by a very thin whitish film that dissipates very quickly. But without even putting my nose near the glass, the aroma of extraordinarily sweet almond extract jumps out of the glass. The first sip confirms this. Sweet Jesus, this could easily substitute in a pinch for your cake recipe! It’s taken me several sips, but now I’ve finally figured out exactly what this beer tastes like: the well-known and tasty aperitif by Sonoma Valley Portworks called Duet, a cream sherry with natural hazelnut. So rather than tasting like white chocolate, I guess the six years has oxidized this beer to the point of making it taste like sherry. Really, at no point does this make me think I’m drinking beer -- it’s not the least bit malty, hoppy or bitter, it’s minimally carbonated, and the full-on sweet hazelnut never relinquishes its hold as the dominant flavor. Frankly, I find it pretty enjoyable, but I love dessert wines like sherry. Body is somewhat heavy at first, almost syrupy, but thins considerably in the finish. I never drank this beer when it was freshly bottled, but with it tasting like hazelnut cream sherry, I’ll go out on a limb here and say this has improved greatly over the six years.
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;In the tiny bottle from Gomer’s. Very sweet and artificial. Pours a pale golden amber with no head at all. In fact, it looks like a cider. The chocolate aroma is big. Smells like hot chocolate and amaretto. It is very mead-like in the palate having a rich sweetness. Reminds me a bit of cream soda. This beer has no semblance of hops whatsoever. Quite unusual and for that it gets big creativity points from me.
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;This is a nice after dinner beer or a great way to satisfy that chocolate craving. It is very good
Dixie White Moose;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Dixie Brewing Co.;I have never had a beer before that tasted so much like white chocolate in all of my life. Sweet and chocolately and no that much alcohol. I love this stuff. I am pretty sure it’s not made anymore.

Lucknow Munich Style Lager;Moultonborough, New Hampshire, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Castle Springs Brewing Co. - Lucknow;Malty malty malty!

Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale amber in colour with slight malt note in the aroma. Thin mouth feel and good lacing. Pale malts in the mouth leading to an overall sweetish taste but with little flavour however. Very little hops detected in the dilute aftertaste. Finish is weak and watery with a hint of barley sugar. A poor session bitter.

Not bad, but not very subtle or balanced.
Haerlemsch Winterbier;Haarlem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;(Bottle 30 cl) This beer really looks like liquid tar. Pitch black, thick and syrupy with a dark brown head. This comes closer to an Imperial Stout, but in spite of the extreme alcohol it’s very drinkable. Some smoked notes, warming but not alcoholic.

Extremely powerful flavour; burnt malt, alcohol, syrupy texture. Sweet and with a long, dry finish - not to well balanced though. Or perhaps it needs aging?

Halve Maan Lazarus;Hulst, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bierbrouwerij Vermeersen (previously known as de Halve Maan);"09-06-2019; bottle; at home (bought at an unknown location). The looks of the beer are fine. The colour is a amber-brown with a greyish hint. It is a bit pale. It is quite cloudy and also has some flaky things there. I don't like this in a beer. On top of the beer there is a soft creamy slightly yellow tinted layer of foam. Foam retention is average. A nice drape of foam is left on top of the beer. The aroma of the beer is fine. Malts are simple and grainy. Toasted touch, but not more than that. The hops are herbal, but a bit rough and astringent. It's a bit too much bitter hops maybe. The taste of the beer gives the same impression. Bitter hops, that are too strong to be compensated by the sweetness from the malts. It is a bit too bitter. Could be smoother. The palate of the beer is fine. Medium body, slightly sticky texture and medium carbonation. The beer is a bit rough. The finish has strong bitterness, and is quite rough. All in all, not the best beer. I had better. It feels a bit rough."

K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;On Tap at the Bar Fringe, Manchester 09/03/2001 Strong in alcohol with cherry aroma and flavour.
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;[LCRBM] unexpectedly decent considering the absolutly shocking bottle. cherry aroma, slightly spicey. nice body, dry and tart finish.
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;[RBG Low Countries 2005] Siruppy, cherrie aroma with a hint of flemish sour ale. Hazy, brown coloured with no head. Sweet, fruity taste with -surprisingly- some tartness. Quite a full taste, just a little too sweet. Not too bad this stuff from the colourfull bottle.
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Bottle. Tragic looking bottle, just take a look at the pciture to the left!!!! Sweet and lightly spicy, with some lightly tart/sour berry fruit in the finish, not bad, and better than i thought it would be.
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Surprisingly this beer scores this good. Could it be because nobody expects a thing from this beer? Because people compare it to the B12 energy beer? Or just because it is a nice mix of a (sweet) kriek and a flemish sour ale? I just don’t know, but I won’t adjust my rating for that. :-)
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;No#46. Thankfully the beers is better than the bottle. A nice sour cherry aroma. Taste is same with a nice dry finish. Although not a very complex beer and a good opening to someone who wants to try more intresting beers, still worth a bash.
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Bottle at RBG Low Countries 2005 Brown to black body. Lightly brown head. Cherry and cask wood aroma. Lightly sweet, lightly bitter initial flavour. Moderately sweet finish. Very odd, neither sweet, neither sour, a very weird unbalanced beer.
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;(Bottle 33 cl) God this has an awful, cheap appearance - but fortunately it surprises in a good way. Opaque, almost black with a red glow and a reddish head. Pronounced cherry flavour, sweet and spicy but not artificial or cloying. Wonder what the base beer is for this. 060799
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;This was described at the bar as a flemish sour ale, but I am not sure if that is truly the style. It was a bit too fruity to be considered one, yet the aroma and the color lended themselves to the bar classification. This is something worth trying, as it is different with a nice finish.
K8;Emelgem, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck;Reddish brown coloured. Sweet and mature cherry aroma and flavour. Notes of cinnamon. Round mouthfeel. Very ugly bottle.
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;Poured into a pilsener glass, the appearance had a copper color with a big fluffy off white head with a mild stringy yet somewhat messy lace. The aroma had somewhat of a decent blend of caramel and earth. Burnt pomme-like fruits try to make a presence. The flavor took those previously mentioned aromas to blend and end up giving off a mild burnt earthy to crackery taste. This grips the aftertaste and leans towards the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed decent. ABV seemed a bit higher than some other doppelbocks I have had. Overall, well, the flavor and aroma seem a bit different than expected for a good to even great doppelbock. Trying to get past some of that burnt-ness in the aroma and flavor. Probably wouldn’t seek again.
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;wow - low scores for this. I enjoyed it. Classically bready and toast forward nose and flavor. Perhaps could be a touch more robust, but quite nice overall.
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;Bottle from Damon’s Beverage Mart in Augusta Deep copper color with a huge fluffy off white head. Smells of caramel and earth with a light sweet fruitiness. Sweet caramel maltiness with a bit of fruitiness and earth. Dry finish with a thin mouthfeel and a lingering sweetness. Sample is a bit old and a bit meh
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;22oz bottle, thanks chriso. Small beige head atop cloudy red-dark brown body. Aroma is moderately sweet, caramel, some chocolate. Taste is medium sweet, sour, some chocolate, light cherry. Clearly infected. Smooth medium body.
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;22oz bomber courtesy of joepais poured into a tulip. Pours a deep, clear copper with a huge three inch off-white head that recedes fairly quickly to a small cap and leaves some spotty lacing. The aroma is a little weird. It’s got the standard sweet caramel malts and toffee which I was expecting, but it’s also got some vanilla and a unique sourness, especially evident as it warms. The taste follows the aroma almost exactly with the same sourness as the aroma which is a little distracting, especially as it lingers through the finish. The caramel malts and toffee are there, but it’s the sourness that shows most. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has some soft carbonation and a dry sourness in the finish that is a little disconcerting. This is an OK doppelbock but I’m not entirely sure if it’s gone a little bad with the metallic sourness indicating a bit of oxidation.
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;I visted Oak Pond yesterday and picked up a case of various brews Don had. The Doppelbock was taste-tested yesterday, this has to be the beast dark beer I have had in a very long time. It has a complex but not overpowering floavor. Unlike many dark beers it does not require you chew it before you swallow it.
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;22 oz bottle poured reddish brown with a small white head that turned to a thin lace Aromas of sweet malts some roasted malt tossed in. The palate is creamy. Flavors of toasted malts along with sweet malts there is an ever so slite hop bitter end to it . Honestly a good doppelbock for a great price. I think this may be Oak Ponds bet offering so far. will be back for more of these
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;22oz bomber from Lou’s. Red-brown fairly translucent body with a half inch of off-white head.. Smells malty sweet. Tastes like a roasty caramel malt sweetness with some burnt malt, just a touch of diacetyl, and a hint of alcohol. Medium body. A nice combination/balance of flavors. Makes for a drinkable brew. Not the best dopplebock I’ve had, but a good one, and deffinitely something I’d get again (esp at 2.49$ per bomber). Definitely a brewer I’ll be buying more from in the near future.
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;(22 oz. bottle) Pours a ruby-tinted brown with a small biege head. Aroma is malt and brown sugar. Some lacing. Mouthfeel a little fizzy, a little thin, still pretty smooth. Tastes of malty sweetness with some brown sugar and alcohol, fairly bitter finish. Plenty of alcohol here. Overall not bad, mostly suffers from lack of complexity for a doppel. This brewery was closed and re-started in the last couple of years, so has a new owner (and maybe new brewer). Don’t know if there have been any changes to the beers they make.
Oak Pond Storyteller Doppelbock;Skowhegan, Maine, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Oak Pond Brewery;"Wow this guy (ericmoss3799) is adamant that this brewery is a well-kept secret. It looks like it was a much higher quality brewery in days past. 2005 bomber shared with Muzzlehatch on 5/22/2005 at the ""Crappy Maine beers plus two random Belgians and a Cider"" Tasting. Orange-amber with some gold highlights. No head, no lacing, clear, filtered. Smells of tobacco, old, stale coffee grinds, some caramel and cabbage. Has that typical filtered, American hardness about it. Some light malt grains, a bit of grassiness, musty attic flavors, rope. Watery, no yeast apparency. Would not identify this as a bock, let alone a doppelbock."

Achel 8 Blond;Hamont-Achel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij der Trappistenabdij De Achelse Kluis;330ml bottle brewed in Belgium at 8%. Very pale gold, almost yellow, and almost clear. Banana and lemon zest aroma. Very small head, lingering for a long time. Lowish carbonation, but with that in-mouth foaming. Complex flavours, bit of Belgian yeast banana, bit of tangerine, oily mouthfeel leaving lingering golden syrup flavours with a slight orange juice tang, a real pudding of a beer, yet refreshing to boot. 8% ABV is not tasted whatsoever, although pretty noticeable in that you don't get much if any low ABV beers tasting like this. Highly recommended strong blond.

Konrad Svetlé Výčepní (Vratislav) 10°;Vratislavice nad Nisou, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovary Vratislavice (Hols a.s.);Nice durable foam and a nice aroma of malt, yeast and a bit of hops. The taste is fresh grain and light bread with sweet malt notes in the background. It is a very typical and very Czech pilsner, understood in that it is very pure in taste and thus a pilsner without huge amounts of malt and hops. The saaz hops are tender and balance the sweetness and bitterness very well.

Clear gold, not a lot of head or lacing, some slow-rising carbonation. Aromas are bread and biscuit with hints of flowers and honey. More of the same in the mouth, mid bitterness and touches of astringency, dry light texture with a solid finish. Quite heavy for the style, but an antidote to all feeble pale lagers.

Super pale yella with fair amount of white foam. A bit soapy but all in all its the right mix of floral and noble hops and fresh bread. Crisp bitter, grainy, bready. Svetly!

Piana, za sprawą intensywnie pracującego nasycenia utworzyła się obfita, jest drobna, zwarta i puszysta. Ma barwę złamanej bieli i dobrą retencję - redukuje się bardzo wolno, a przy tym ładnie lepi się do szkła. Aromat nie jest zbyt wyraźny. Zawiera w sobie przede wszystkim nuty słodowe, chlebowo – zbożowe oraz nieco ziołowego chmielu. Przy pierwszym łyku zaskakuje odczuciem sporej pełni, ma też charakterystyczną dla czeskich piw lekką maślaną śliskość. Profil smakowy jest praktycznie tożsamy z aromatem. Przyjemnej, chlebowo – zbożowej słodowości towarzyszy jednak wyczuwalnie zaznaczona, chmielowa goryczka o ziołowym profilu, lekko zalegająca, dająca zdecydowanie wytrawny finisz.

Mariestads Export;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Spendrups Bryggeri;Piana szybko ucieka do zera. Aromat słodowy, troszkę miodowy, lekko stęchły po zamieszaniu, ale generalnie do przeżycia. W smaku klasyka eurolagera, czyli trochę słodu i dalej pustka, bez znamion goryczy. Na plus na pewno czysty profil. Nasycenie CO2 wysokie. Tragedii nie ma, ale raczej sam bym sobie nie kupił.
Mariestads Export;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Spendrups Bryggeri;Flaska på Frimurarlogen i Karlstad. Snabbt döende skumkrona som lämnar en gardin. Doften är klassisk kontinental lager, med det där brödigt söta, med en liten humletouch som avslutning. Färgen är en fullständigt blank gyllengul hyllning till svensk lager. Smaken är som en allsvensk match där mitt lag lämnar walkover, det vill säga utan poäng! Humleleveransen fastnade i rondellen och kom inte till bryggeriet förrän brygden var buteljerad, så de sågs genom flaskglaset. En lite söt eftersmak ger inte någon fortsatt längtan att dricka mer. Typisk svensk lager...

Klein Duimpje Hillegoms Tarwe Bier;Hillegom, Netherlands;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;As Hillegoms Weizen, apparently the new name of this beer, being intended as a classic Bavarian Hefeweizen (but adding oat to the malt bill, untraditionally). Thanks Craftmember! Mousy, egg-white, medium thick, slowly opening and eventually dissipating head, misty warm pale orange-hued peach blonde robe. Aroma of ripe peach, red apple, soap, cooked pear, vague nutmeg hint, ripe pineapple, some banana, white bread, honey, cloves, very vague accent of cooked meat-like phenols. Sweet, fruity, estery onset, touch of banana but more peach- and pineapple-like, quite pronounced wheat sourishness underneath, medium carbonation, slick bready maltiness, sweetish, touch of floral hops in the finish but remaining low in bitterness, phenolic accents but less clove-like than would typically be the case in this style, lingering sweet fruitiness and wheat sourishness. Refreshing, rounded, fruity-sweetish interpretation of the style, not quite precise in its German Hefeweizen intentions, but quenching and well-made.
Klein Duimpje Hillegoms Tarwe Bier;Hillegom, Netherlands;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;Bottle shared thanks to Deanso. Clear golden with white head. Clear golden, at least until I poured the yeast in. Nice white head. Cloves, lemon, plastic, some dough, diesel, pils malts. Over medium sour lemon and under medium sweet. Some light plastic bitterness. Medium bodied. The sourness is not the worst, the plastic notes are quite bad.

ABV 5.5% Deep orange golden colour on the body, with a disappointing head, just one thin line,less than one finger of white foam with low retention, leaving light lacing on the glass. Aroma has the typical banana but more like concetrated banana juice instead of a fresh one. Apple juice too, this one smells like a juice cocktail. Taste is better though, light wheat, quite sweet and a little bit grainy.Some citrus fruits as well, something reminding of curacao or kumquat. On the aftertaste is notable again the banana and apple juice flavours, but it becomes light bitter on the finish, with okay duration and a subtle metallic flavour. Medium thin body, okay carbonation. Overall okay hefe, a bit weird but still enjoyable.

Klein Duimpje Kerstbier;Hillegom, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;Okay…. This is a mothfull of cloves…. Sure, they wanted to create a X-mas brew with the right spices, but this is too much. The first sips are only dominated by the clove note. And honestly, my first intention was to pour it. But after a couple of sips, you get used to the taste and you’ll discover other nuances such as licorice, roasted bread and a dry hop note. All topped by a nice alcohol burn. I believe that this beer, with less spices added, would be a nice winter warmer. A shame, too much spices drown the good base of this beer. Less would be much more!

Newport Storm Regenschauer Oktoberfest;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Newport Craft Brewing;Bottle. Used to drink this stuff when I lived in RI. A good go to local brew. Not worth buying for the price out of state if you see it.
Newport Storm Regenschauer Oktoberfest;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Newport Craft Brewing;This local boy is copper colored and smells as much like a brown ale as a marzen lager. In any case, the smell is very malty. Drinking his beer is is like eating a slice of fermented white bread. The brewer’s description lists the hops used, but the low IBU figure reflects that they are lost in the mix. Medium body, soft finish.
Newport Storm Regenschauer Oktoberfest;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Newport Craft Brewing;12oz bottle in a shaker. Pours copper with a lacy, off-white head. Aroma of toasted and nutty malts with floral and slightly citrusy hops. Flavor strong on the malts. Average texture, and a little smoother than most of this style. A decent beer.
Newport Storm Regenschauer Oktoberfest;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Newport Craft Brewing;12oz bottle, thanks to my mom for picking up the sixer. Mildly hazy amber-orange color, medium head fading to minimal, leaving a little lacing. I usually find oktoberfest beers to be boring, but I can tell from the first sip that this one is a good one. It has enough hops to give it a bit of flavor to the typical savory malt. A touch of bitterness. Pronounced carbonation, but satisfactory texture. A good pairing to my grape leave rolls.
Newport Storm Regenschauer Oktoberfest;Newport, Rhode Island, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Newport Craft Brewing;Has a murky orange color with a citrus like aroma. Very zesty bubbles. It doesn’t taste bad but seems to lack something I can’t nail down. The citrus hops lingers on your tongue.

Ayinger Kellerbier;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Aying;Picked this up from Bayerisches Bierspezialitäten Pararadies Bienenfleiß, consumed at home Attenkirchen, Sunday 17th November 2019 whilst listening to Warmduscher - Tainted Lunch, cooking Goulash, Bread Dumplings and Potato Gratin and Brussels. Pours hazy orange with a white head. A little yeasty note and yeasty, bready and grainy in the mouth. I'm a little disappointed by this, was hoping for more from it, it's ok but ultimately disappoints.
Ayinger Kellerbier;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Aying;Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow on tap with fluffy white foam that slowly dissipates to leave good lacing. Aroma of nice pilsner and melanoidin malt notes over an earthy and floral hop, and nice German lager yeast. Taste follows, full body with a crisp finish, great hop character yet still super crushable. Very nice.
Ayinger Kellerbier;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Aying;"500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 4.9%. Largeish shortish lasting head. Beautiful near-opaque banana yellow. Mild pear-esque aroma. Low carbonation. Absolute stonker. Faint bready malt, mild fruity hop bitterness, all tied together by the star of the show, the complex (hints of banana, pear, citrus, and more) fruity sweet yeast. Cool and thick mouthfeel. The yeast makes this beer, I think. Richer and more complex in flavour than a lager has any right to be. Smooth and refreshing at the same time. This is a straightforward presentation on your palate, not strong or unruly, but with a rich swathe of flavour painted for you to appreciate. What are normally thin, reedy flavours in a lager are here tied together by the yeast and the effect is somewhat like drinking a ""real"" lager for the first time in your life - you can see what every other one had taken out of them, this is a painting and the others are more like architects diagrams. I exaggerate, of course. There are good lagers with rich, developed malt and hops - and this one does not have especially developed malt and hops. But it doesn't have to. The yeast joins all the dots, and the picture jumps out at you. A must-try style to understand what lager can be."

The flavour is weakly watery, weakly bready, but somehow also highly unpleasant. I had a few sips and chucked it. This stuff is disgusting and unworthy of a serious review. I'm very surprised that the brewer of some of my all-time favourite beers is putting its name on this.

Gordon Scotch Ale / Mc Douglas Scotch Ale;Genval, Belgium;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Martin;Удивительно но запах съож на нотки такого стиля как ламбик- фаро. Такие же приятно тошнотворно-сладкие нотки карамели и с приходом ириса. Очень много солода буквально бросаются на тебя уже при открытие. Легкие пряные ноты. Цвет темный, но прозрачный без осадка, пенка небольшая. Вкус более прямой, умеренно крепкий, ощущается теплота в горле. Немного карамели, слегка поджаренной что ли. Снова много разного солода, как и как будто для лагера так и карамельного. Легкая совсем нативная горчинка для пусичек. Послевкусие сладкое, карамель, ирис далее немного травянистости с намеками на патоку и сухофрукты.В целом весьма неплохо.

Dark chestnut with a ruby tint. Creamy light beige head. Sweet throughout - pretty syrupy. A fruit sour edge.

Two fingers of off-white to tan head on top, very thick, with good retention, leaving mediu lacing on the glass. It starts well. Weird aroma, malts and sugars and caramels but also something rather artificial, like they put something in there to add some fruity notes but it smells now quite chemical. Sour notes as well. Taste is sweet but only for a moment, thenbecomes very sour and not the good kind of sour. Old fruits, sour grapes that have gone bad, burnt caramel. Notable alcohol on the finish and again artificial. Medium thin body, average carbonation. They told me the Koelschip beers were bad but I wouldn’t believe them. Worst bock ever, I wouldn’t give it to my enemies.

t Kuipertje Nachtvorst;Heukelem, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij t Kuipertje;Bottle courtesy of Deanso. Poured a cloudy medium amber with a round bubbly white head. The aroma is big boozy alcohol and little else. The flavour is strong bitter light sweet with a major yeast alcoholic palate. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. I wished I’d tried the tap version of this at Gouda because the bottled version was pretty awful. Its all about the alcohol and that’s where it ends. Almost undrinkable tbh.

Cergal;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);This beer is awful. I've tried multiple times since I'm a student and it's super cheap but I don't think it's worth it. It has a skunkiness to it (not in a good way) and its aftertaste is bitter and can be a bit sour. Also, the head vanishes like soda after pouring. Not recommended.
Cergal;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);25cl Bottle from a local shop in Tentúgal. Holland Style Lager Beer is what caught my eye. Taste-wise, they're not lying. If bland, sweet-ish fizzy swill is what defines the 'style'. Nothing off though, so at least it's drinkable.
Cergal;Vialonga, Portugal;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (Heineken Group);Cheaper than chips at just 36cents a can. Cergal is a 'Holland Type Lager'??? 'Imported' is written all around the brim of the can, but hold on, what's this I see, on the can itself it says that the beer is produced and bottled by Sociedade Central de Cervejas e Bebidas (SCC) and what's more, written below this is the exact address of the fraudulent company! What have I unearthed? A crime. But what do you care? It's a beer and it's cheaper than Superbock. Trump's fault.

Totally clear pale golden, creamy white head. Nose is stale wet corn, urinal wet grains, field after rain, vegetables, rotting paper, stale starch lager.

Not good but as far as industrial pale lagers go, this one is definitely not the worst, strange vegetable oil sweetness works partially to its advantage, not too much vegetables.

Löwenbräu Alkoholfrei;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);It seems hard to make a good n/a pilsener or lager - not enough variables to play with? Krombacher and a few others seem to have found a method, but Löwenbräu hasn't (imo). The smell is too sweet, the taste is too sweet and the finish is too sweet. I suppose that's one way of avoiding wateriness, but I don't think it's a very good one. Aromas include hay and... boiled carrot. Perhaps that's just me. :-)

Kulmbacher Mönchshof Weihnachts Bier;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Drunk from a flip top bottle on a train. Aromas of mild coffee, herbs, toast, cloves, and rye bread. Sweet and sugary, with a nice, fairly assertive bitterness. Light to medium body, with a grainy, sticky mouthfeel. A little weak, but pretty nice.

La Binchoise Flora;Binche, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie La Binchoise;Spring ale with yellowish, loose, not very stable foam and clear amber colour. Aroma fruity and caramelly, nutty malts with sweet touches of orange and pear. Taste reminiscent of a spéciale beige, with nutty and caramelly malts dominating, lightly sweet, low hopping and therefore insufficiently bitter finish, but otherwise quite okay.
La Binchoise Flora;Binche, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie La Binchoise;Bouteille 75cl. Déception que cette bière, tout comme de nombreuses bières de La Binchoise. Nom évoquant une abondance de houblons, au profil estival se retrouve diminuée par une belle mal balancée. Couleur ambrée-cuivrée, col beige moyen. Arôme est malté avec un bouquet clairement belge, houblon est moyen et citronné. Palais malté, caramel, pâle, pointe d’épice avec une dominance des malts qui obscure la dimension des houblons. Ce dernier reste assez neutre et ne procure en rien un profile qui pour moi évoque une relation avec le nom de la bière. Note de sucre candi en fin de bouche.

La Binchoise Flora;Binche, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie La Binchoise;Bottle @ Heeren Van Liedekercke Bierfest, 2012. Pours cloudy amber with a small white head. Nose is yeast, perfume and candy. Flavor is caramel, yeast, flowers and fruit. Full bodied. Dry.
La Binchoise Flora;Binche, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie La Binchoise;Pours a hazy medium orangish amber color. Aroma is lightly malty, hoppy, yeasty, with a touch of fruit. Flavor is a nice mixture of malts and fruits.
La Binchoise Flora;Binche, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie La Binchoise;Reddish brown with chunks floating about with a thin lasting head. Aromas of fruit (cherries in liqueur), malt and yeast. Nice flavour kinda subtle with more of the fruits, oranges as well some yeast and a bit of hop bitterness meshed with perfect sweetness. Very good.

Pours a lively, deep amber body and a lofty, white head. Nose of apricot, herbs and oranges. Flavour is more malted with a brown sugar and roasted malt dominance - a spiced hop undertone is well muted. Very good.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;341mL bottle from an LCBO sixer. Pours a nice deep copper colour with a medium off white head. Aroma is nice, caramalized malt with a some tin and hops that makes it not seem like its going to be totally gross like most so called honey beers. The flavour follows through quite well with more toffee and caramalized, with a bit of grainy sweetness to back it up, almost toasty malts and a minor hop bite. Creamy feel the whole way through. Quite nice for a buckabeer, and a HONEY buckabeer at that. Lakeport Honey wishes it was anything remotely like this brew. I think this one has been given a bit of an unfair rough ride here what with the low rating.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;341ml bottle, 4.8% a/v Pours a whiskey gold colour with a fairly generous offwhite head. The aroma is cereal and grains with a hint of chemicals, and nearly no hops to speak of. The taste is actually not bad, like the smell a bit chemically but overall a beer which is only exceptional in how average it is for the buck a beers.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;341ml bottle, very grainy nose, and a very mealy/cereal/grainy flavour, the honey adds a slight sweet flavour, meh, not bad.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;341 ml bottle. pours thin orange with a big white head that is gone quickly. big carbonation bubbles. weak aromas of grass with some traceable sweetness. bland boring flavours with a dry finish. i wish brewers would stop making honey lagers.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;From memory. I can’t get over the odd distasteful feeling I got whenever I drank this beer. I think it was due to the artificial sweetness. There was a weird cloying each time I drank. It seems oddly prejudiced, but I just shudder every time I think of this beer. There was a sort of bland maltiness and sweetness, but not a malt sweetness. Six overall because it ties Muskoka Premium Lager (a far superior beer) for the cheapest bottled beer available in Ontario.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;Bottle fresh from brewery Honey beers are not to everyone’s taste as they tend to offend with too much sweetness or not enough honey flavor…This one has trimmed back hops like the others but there is an excellent balance between fresh bready malt and tangy natural honey flavor which seems to compliment the hopping without being overly sweet….malty, decently balanced for the style this is my second favorite Honey lager….and fresh tasting too.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;Like the Muskoka Lager, this has become a buck-a-beer. Not the best beer out there but pretty good for the price considering the competition. If you’re a fan of cheap honey beers this is your best choice, otherwise this is just an average beer. Aroma and appearance are typical of this type of beer. Flavour is nothing special.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;On tap at Musa (the best of a bad bunch) - amber colour. Almost nothing in the nose, a bit of sweet malt, that’s pretty much it. Taste is a bit better, some balance, but everything’s just waaaaay too subtle and watered down. Better than the buck-a-beer honey lagers I’ve had, but not by much. Very average. Might be nice on a hot summer day, but nothing I’d choose again.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;Bottle- Pours deep amber with a short lived bubbly fizz. Fore-runners in the nose are sweet grain, butter, and caramel. Faint malt too. Taste is sweet grainy malt, with honey, corn, and watered down toffee. Sweet watery finish. Standard.
Muskoka Honey Brown Lager;Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Muskoka Brewery;Hazy reddish amber with a thick off white head. Lightly sulfuric aroma. In mouth, sweet malt, a bit cloying, with light honey notes, not much hops, very bland and boring. Bought in singles bin, LCBO.

Rich dark brown beer with a brown head that thins out quickly. Crystal malt smell, but ""drier"" than normal. The cask pull gives it a texture that slides around easily on my tongue. After a swallow, the air in my mouth is redolent with the Kentish hops. A session style is hard to get excited about, but this is indeed a well-tuned ale."

Goose Island Cask ESB;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Admit that I’ve been really spoiled by some the cask IPAs here. This was a very good, down to earth ESB with enough to hold it together being on cask. That alone says a llot to me as there have been so many places I’ve been to in the U.S. that seem to see cask as being a gimmick rather than an apropriate means of serving. Goose Island knows what they’re doing.

Aromas of bread, light carmel and light earthiness. Palate was medsium bodied and smooth with a chalky finish. Flavors of carmel, straw and light earthiness with a smooth chalky finish.
Hops Hoptoberfest;Madison, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);"Growler from the Richmond/Midlothian, VA location. The chalkboard at the brewpub said ""Winter Amber (Marzen)."" The tap handle said winter amber. It’s definitely a marzen. Pours a reddish chestnut color with a large head. Good head retention and lacing. Taste is carmel, nutty grain notes, leafy hops and maybe just a hint of butter. Taste is toasted malts, nutty toffee notes with grassy, bitter hops. Light cinnamon in the finish. Medium bodied. Maybe a bit too much on the bitter side, but still very good."
Hops Hoptoberfest;Madison, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Depending on your individual brewmaster this beer differs from location to location, my experience has been that this beer is very decent, malty, hints of carmelly sweetness, paired with a good amount of hoppyness
Hops Hoptoberfest;Madison, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Poured a light copper color, with a full head. Sweet typical Oktoberfest style. Refreshing and a easily drinkable beer. At 4.5% wouldn’t mind it as a session beer.
Hops Hoptoberfest;Madison, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);has a lot going for it considering that a little too much and slightly cloying sweetness screws the whole thing up. as you can see nice aroma and everything else speaks to a 3.3+ rating. pretty authentic but the sweetness seems a bit off which of course is suicide when offered up to us as a marzen. slightly tweaked this beer can do much better.
Hops Hoptoberfest;Madison, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);From tap at hops : Light clear color with small white head. Very light. Fruity flavor and ending. Not very hoppy or octoberfesty.
Hops Hoptoberfest;Madison, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Draft at Sanford, FL. Poured a clear copper color with an average creamy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted malt aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met and the beer went well with the Bratwurst Platter.
Leeuw Winterwit;Valkenburg an den Geul, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Leeuw;Bottle: This is another beer I recently found a note about that I tasted this one many years ago. I remember it was quit spicy and had some sort of barley bitter sweetness as well as full bodied and a fine mouthfeel. I liked it and hope they will once start brewing this beer again.
Leeuw Winterwit;Valkenburg an den Geul, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Leeuw;(Bottle 30 cl) Usually you associate Witbiers with spring or summer - a light quencher. But this is one of few winter wits. Orangey, honey coloured with a very limited head and a rather low carbonation. Quite refined and spicy with some of the usual notes of orange peel and coriander. But this is more potent and full-bodied. Dry and very fruity with a slight bitterness. Nice indeed. 140401
Leeuw Winterwit;Valkenburg an den Geul, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Leeuw;Sweet, full, spicy. All just a bit better as the normal Leeuw Valkenburgs Wit.
Tatran Export Lager (Ležiak 12°);Poprad, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Pilsberg;Ich kann mich noch erinnern wie ich vor einigen Jahren dieses Bier in einer Zahnradbahn von Štrba nach Štrbské Pleso getrunken habe und dass es tiefer Winter war, was es mir erlaubt hat das Bier in einer Schneewechte zu kühlen bzw. zu verstecken. Es ist ein vollmundiges Bier, das zwar keine wirkliche Eigenständigkeit hat, aber meinen Bierdurst damals gut gestillt hat.

Tatran Export Lager (Ležiak 12°);Poprad, Slovakia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Pilsberg;Bottle, bought in Poprad. Smells macrolager-ish but the taste has that bread&Saaz feel, rounded off by residual sugars and a medium bitterness that makes such beers so enjoyable. Good one.

Krolewskie;Warka, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Warka (Grupa Żywiec - Heineken);Dla mnie to piwo dyskwalifikuje dodanie kukurydzy celem zaoszczędzenie na surowcu i odkąd ten składnik się pojawił przestałem pijać to piwo.
Krolewskie;Warka, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Warka (Grupa Żywiec - Heineken);Keg, Free drink at the Hampton Warsaw, 15/07/19. Clear golden blonde with a decent white cap.

Krolewskie;Warka, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Warka (Grupa Żywiec - Heineken);Piwo kupione i pite głównie z czystej ciekawości jak smakuje to słynne warszawskie piwo. Cena wygórowana nie jest i zaczyna się od 2.30Zł jak przystało na koncerniaka z niższej półki. Od piwa wiele nie oczekiwałem w sumie tak jak już pisałem to była głównie ciekawość. Skład nie zwiastował nic dobrego.. kukurydza. Dodatki niesłodowane powinny dać nuty bimbrowe i sporą dawkę alkoholu. Chmiel w składzie jest, ale o moich odczuciach smakowych za chwilę. Piwo było pite z butelki, więc piany i laycingu nie ocenię. Kolor każdy może zgadnąć. Zapewne jasny, słomkowy i przejrzysty bez zmętnienia. Zapach dość specyficzny, a zarazem bardzo charakterystyczny jak na koncerniaka. Określająć go jednym słowem to - spirytus. I naprawdę on przeważa w woni. Na drugim planie kukurydza i trochę słodu. W smaku piwo mnie odrzuciło. Pierwsze co atakuje nasze kubki to bardzo słabo zamaskowany alkohol. Wydaje mi się, że producent celowo tak zrobił, by konsument odniósł wrażenie, że pije produkt na spirytusie. Jego zawartość to 5.8%, ale te bimbrowe nutki robią to piwo prawie niepijalne. Jak już przeżyjemy tą bombę spirytusu to czeka nas lekki kukurydziany DMS i gdzieś tam na końcu słód/zboże. Gdzie tu chmiel ? Jak na koncerniaka przystałao nie ma go prawie wcale. Po pół butelki zacząłem wyczuwać lekką chmielową goryczkę, ale to bardziej zaciąganie garbnikowe niż goryczka chmielowa. Jedne z najgorszych piw jakie piłem. Jedynie co przemawia za nim to bardzo niska cena taka jak innych polskich koncerniaków typu Tatra i Warka. Jak ktoś chce się nawalić małym kosztem to polecam, ale dla smaku stanowczo odradzam !
Krolewskie;Warka, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Warka (Grupa Żywiec - Heineken);Zapach słaby ledwo słodowy, smak również nie powala. Wodniste, leciutko słodowe z nieprzyjemnym gorzkim finiszem. Nuda.

Aroma: Strong aroma of fresh yeasts, slightly alcoholic nose, when you sniff deeper strong winy - red, fruity aroma, a bit accidic, aroma is the most close to a poor quality, seasonal table wine which is too old and begins to smell vinegar, strawberries and wildberries, but again winy and kind of artificial. Flavour: Soft, thin, wattery and with poor aftertaste. Lacking in body maltyness, some hops of poor character kicking your nose, crystalized honey, poor watered down table wine, very wattery, diacetyl, aftertaste is slightly chalky, red currant, strawberry, wildberry but a bit unfresh and artificial. Finish duration is medium. Palate: Body is light, texture is wattery, carbonation on palate is mild, finish feel is chalky a bit and sticky sweet with red fruity accent.

Aspen Meadow Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Had on 8/2/200. Aroma is a light malt scent. Color is bright clear gold with good carbonation and head. Taste is light and crisp. Starting with a light body it goes down crisp and clean.

Aspen Meadow Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Light gold with no head. Aroma is sweet and caramely. Pale ale?

Aspen Meadow Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;12 oz. bottle. Pours hazy copper with minimal head. Malty, sweet nose. Flavor is sweet and malty as well. Pretty damn bad. Pale ale my ass. Drainpour.

Aspen Meadow Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Thanks to Tom, for sharing this- my first beer from the great Gluek Brewing Company! Pours a very light golden color and a thin fizzy white head. Aroma is loaded with DMS (cooked corn moslty with slight cabbage notes), very light bready pils malt, and some herbal hops. No crystal malt found in the aroma or flavor, or hops for that matter. Just some bland malt, and lots of DMS found throughout. If you want to know what DMS is like in a beer, this is a good example. Metallic aftertaste and cabbage-like.

Aspen Meadow Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Another one for the bad brew books,Decent golden color,small white head that faded quickly leaving little behind.The aroma was forgettable,light malt sort of sweet with a faint attempt at hops.There is a bit of fruit coming through but just barely.The flavor was weak for a PA,malty and sweet with very nearly no hops at all.slight sweet malt after taste with just a faint hint of hops coming through.I have to wonder if these guys really know how to brew or do they just throw grains and hops together and hope for a brew that is semi drinkable.Just plain nasty and i wouldn’t recommend this even if you just want a rateing.
Aspen Meadow Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;First its not a pale ale. Overly malty and sweet. Bad. Had a hard time getting through one. The ingredients seemed very low quality, which in turns makes a very low quality beer. Yuck, touch of terrible hops at the end. Don't Buy.

Pitfield Shoreditch Stout;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Stout;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Opaque. Brown, thin, patchy head. Aroma of peat & roast malt and hint of soy and nuts. Wasn’t expecting the (light) smokiness. Quite a nice and fairly complex malty aroma. Fairly full & rounded maltiness, but mid carbonation makes the body feel a little lighter. Dry, roasty and quite good balance. Nice stout, but there’s a soy-like sourness that’s present throughout and lingers, which is a bit too strong. Not bad for 4%.

Was a deep coppery amber coloured ale with good fizz and medium snow white head and sweet, caramelly main profile, honeyish, spicy, yeasty, with a warming, not unpleasant finish and quite high drinkability.

Aroma of wet hair. Bitterness with a nice caramel taste and some sourness is present. Tastes better than it smells! I don’t think it hides the alcohol well. It’s an ok beer to me, but its leaves me wanting more.
Urthel Tonicum Finiboldhus;Ruiselede, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Urthel (Swinkels Family Brewers);Aroma has hints of burnt toffee, cloves, and candy sugar. Flavor is similar, although mainly an emphasis on the sweet toffee/caramel notes. Nothing to much to talk about.

Liefmans Odnar;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);"Very old-fashioned session beer in the Oudenaarde tradition (the name is local dialect for ’Oudenaarde’), in printed bottles; discontinued by Moortgat when they took over the Liefmans brand and already in decline at that time. Basically a watered down version of Liefmans Kriekbier, thinner, lighter, less fruity with a more straightforward profile, but still all-round ’oud bruin’ with malty sweetness coupled with woody sourishness. One of those delightfully old school Flemish beers with little chance of making a comeback, I’m afraid."

Aroma is chemical to sweet raisin. Malty and slight metallic yeasty with a light acidic touch towards sourish. Fruity towards cherry yet also a bit on the malty side and acidic. Towards dry acidic finish, slight watery.
Liefmans Odnar;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle. Vintage 2003 (or 2004?). [thanks for sharing, Skortila!] Pours a deep brown with no head. Aroma has caramel and general musky sourness. Kind of flat. Flavour is lightly sour with a little caramel to balance things up. This might be just a year too cellared :o)
Liefmans Odnar;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);A great beer with only 4.5 % of alcohol. A perfect beer for everyone a little sour and alsoe some sweet things.
Liefmans Odnar;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle @ Oud Arsenaal, Antwerp, december 2004. Pours a brownish/red color with an off-white head. Malty and sour aroma with some hints of wood. Fruity malty sour flavor with some nice sweetness. Nice dry tart malty finish.
Liefmans Odnar;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);"Yesterday tasted, but a know this beer since years. Dark amber-brown with beige head.The ale is more fresh and ""cleaner"" than expected. Fruity sour finsih. A nice sour ale."
Liefmans Odnar;Oudenaarde, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Liefmans (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottled and three years old. Very nice. Ruby and brownish in colour with an off-white head. Wellbalanced sourness and sweetness. Soft and round in a good way. Hints of prunes and maple.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);500ml Dose. Kastanienfarbenes Bier mit festem Schaum. Es riecht nach Rauchmalz und Toffee. Geschmack süss und rauchig. Whiskey im Abgang.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);Golden amber with a nice crown. Nose is malty, sweet, and a little smokey. Taste is much more smokey. Sour. Hint of whisky in the late aftertaste.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);Can 0.5 l. (Six years too old!) Sweet malty aroma. Whisky malt apparant. Nice dark golden color. Large head, that disappears quickly. Smokey sweet malty taste. A bit watery. Quite nice.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);The head is nice on this dark golden beer. The aroma is malty with notes of smoke, and the flavour is as expected smoked - in a not too dominant way. I also get notes of flower and honey and a light sweetness. The smoke comes again in the finish, that has a nicely balanced bitterness. I think this beer should be cold, otherwise the flavour is too malty.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottled, thanks oh6gdx! Clear amber, rich airy head. Evidnly smokey nose. Swet with clean mouthfeel and light body. The smoke remains the only flavour, albeit a pleasant one. Low on hops. Drier finish without bitterness. Some interesting flavour, but a bit sweet, thin and simple.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottle 0.5 l. Golden with a whitish head. From the first nose you can detect the smoked malt similar to islay whiskies. Not too much smoke at all, but very balanced aroma and flavor over a nice german pils with decent hoppiness. This is very drinkable compared to for example Schenkerla’s smoked beers. Nicely complex, yet simple enough not to be too demanding. A subtle delicasy. Very very good.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);Aroma is smoked, bit malty, fruity and some grain. Clear, golden coloured with a lasting, medium head. Taste is sweet (just a bit too sweet imo), slightly smoked, malty, grainy-hoppy. reasonable body. Actually it feels just a bit thick due to sweetness. Perhaps some honey. Quite nice.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottle shared with Hogtown Harry, his bottle. Dark rusty orange, small bubbly white head. Slight hint of seaweed (thanks Harry), smoke, whisky, and light malt - more smoke as it warms, which makes in nicer. Nice taste - light malt, just a bit of smokiness - certainly whisky like and earthy. A nice mix of light malt and whiskey. But also pretty thin and standard stuff. More refreshing because it was the first beer after some exercise as well it should be noted. A tough call but in the end I liked it and would try it again.
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);"Bottle (500ml). Shared with tupalev, my bottle. Poured clear amber-orange with a smallish off-white head. Unusual smokey, seaweedy aroma, pungent, almost sour grain/malt and hop, with iodine sharpness building on warming; very much an Islay malt aroma. The taste was up-front a big barnyard hit, grain, funk - just like a cowbarn in summer, the malt emerged with a bandaid sulfurous character, trying to be juicy (orange juice and lemon zest) - smokey and peaty - hell, it’s really off-putting at first, my first number was 3 out of 10, but it smoothed out and grew on me some. Rather watery body yet the mouthfeel was creamy and chewy, with decent carbonation and a very light, non-aggressive finish. This is an oddball beer for sure, and I found it difficult to rate, but ultimately I enjoyed it - I would love to alternate sips of a Bowmore and another bottle of this, just to see if the Islay character stands up to the real thing."
Henninger Highlander;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Smoked - Other;Henninger Bräu (Radeberger Gruppe);Has a weak spot for smoked, this one is mildly smoked, real pleasent. Nice balance...though, palate is a bit thin. Smoked, mild, lacks hops. Me like!

Augustiner Weissbier;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Augustiner-Bräu;"I was very curious how this beer can be because i like the style.. This beer is more on sweet and fruity direction than spicy like ""Paulaner"" or ""Weihenstephaner"". Has many fruity notes like ""Lemons, Bananas, Oranges ect"" and also some caramel notes maybe. Is sweet and has very decent and good carbonation. Also i find the aftertaste very good and last many seconds.. That is a rare and good thing for one ""Weissbier"".. The only bad here is some metallic taste in the beer.. That is little annoying but still this beer is very good.. Overall a very good smooth and fruity ""Weissbier"" to drink with your food or everywhere you are. Is not so spicy and that can disappointed many people but personal i enjoy the beer.."
Augustiner Weissbier;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Augustiner-Bräu;0.5 l bottle from 'EDEKA Preller' (Breckerfeld), best before December 2019. More or less clear, amber with a medium large, foamy, stable, off-white head. Slightly sweetish, quite yeasty-spicy and a little fruity aroma of banana, clove and some honey. Slightly sweet, moderately bitter, gently yeasty-spicy and a bit fruity taste of banana, lots of clove and some honey, followed by a short, moderately bitter, minimally sourish, rather yeasty-spicy and a bit chalky finish. Medium body, quite effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Pleasant, average Weizen.

Augustiner Weissbier;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Augustiner-Bräu;500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 5.4%. Fruit smoothie colour, murky orangey yellow. Large not-long lasting head. Cereal and banana aroma. Moderate carbonation, not lasting too long in the mouth. Starts with fruity flavours, a fusion of tangerine, peach, and banana, then leads into a wheaty malt finish with some lager malt elements. Very technically accomplished wheat beer in typically straightforward German style. Deliciously refreshing yet savoursome. Augustiner are, I think, one of the better Munich brewers.

Das gelingt zwar, aber ein wirklich guter Geschmack will sich nicht einstellen. EIn wirkliches Bier wird aber hier nicht gebracht.
Clausthaler Extra Herb;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Aus der Pulle. Riecht fruchtig, IPA ähnlich. Der Antrunk ist malzig und hopfig, wobei der Aromahopfen wirklich aussergewöhnlich für ein Alkoholfreies ist. Schmeckt weich im Abgang und angenehm herb. Etwas pappig im Nachtrunk. Der Körper ist etwas wässrig, aber alles noch im Rahmen des Genießbaren. Gar nicht so schlecht für ein Alkoholfreies.
Clausthaler Extra Herb;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Excellent LAB and one of the best on the market. The hop extract covers everything in a positive way. No perceivable sweetness. I do not drink Clausthaler but this beer is very well done. And in regard to the mostly negative feedback. This is not a high-intensity craft beer nor should it be.
Clausthaler Extra Herb;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Flasa z Nemecka. Vona nevyrazna mierne chmelova bylinna. Bledomedova farba. Chut bylinna mierne horka. Slaba.
Clausthaler Extra Herb;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Bottle. Clear golden color, small white head.

Medium carbonation, medium body.
Clausthaler Extra Herb;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Clear golden color with foamy white head. Aroma is heavy malt, grainy.

Clausthaler Extra Herb;Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Binding-Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Not as good as the Classic variant made by the same brewery. I think too much balance is lost if an n/a pilsener is designed to be overly bitter.

KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);From old tasting notes. Clear deep gold color with a big foamy white head. Slightly sour malt aroma. Flavor is light and fruity with a hint of tartness upfront. Fish is sour and lightly hopped. Quaffable but devoid of any real character.
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I had this many years ago and for some reason it has an almost mythical status in Australia. There are always rumors flying around someone has seen for sale somewhere and people getting way too excited if they do find it. I have no idea where the fascination for this beer came from but there is really only one way to describe it: shit!
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);only place ive seen KB lately is the Australian Hotel in Sydney. not what i would call an enjoyable beer, but will always have 1 there on Australia Day, after drinking MANY good quality brews to kill the tastebuds
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);375ml can. Didn’t realise that they still made KB . Bright amber colour with a fluffy white head. Barley and hay aroma , pretty bland and not too much to get excited about. Clean, crisp sweet flavour that is not as bad as expected. Okay overall.
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I love this beer. I have not seen it around in years. Believe it or not, the first time I had one was on Saipan, an island in the Mariana Island chain. I have been looking for it ever since. I was in Auckland and Sydney a few times and had no luck. Needless to say I didn’t find it in Samoa or Tonga either. Too bad I live in the US now because there is even less chance that I will find it here. Cheers, Craig of Saipan.
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Hmmm, its a fine golden beer with just a hint of bitterness and hops. Slightly better than most Aussie ’lagers’ but nothing to write home about. Sure its easy drinking and cheap but if you are after pure gold try something else. A bit watery and good on a hot day.
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);"For rate number 500, I had to pick something special. Growing up in the western suburbs of Sydney during the early 80’s this was the beer. Kids Beer it was commonly known as, but I don’t know why really. Maybe because of the sweetness, but more probably because the gaudy gold can with the big red ’KB’ attracted even the youngest toddlers. I have memories from my early childhood of my father and uncles, all with their Dennis Lillee styled handle-bar moustaches, drinking this around the wood-fired barbie at home during a typical stinking hot Australian summer. Back then I’m sure the cans were textured, and they had the good old ring pull where the whole thing came off in your hand. This is probably the first time I’ve ever seen what the beer looks like, because every red-blooded Australian male knows the only way to drink their KB is out of the can, which is being housed in a styrofoam stubby holder (with or without the Aussie flag design on it). I now discover that the ""cool gold"" of KB is indeed quite golden, with a fairly sparse head. Bugger all aroma, especially if drunk at the correct temperature (ie ice cold straight out of the esky). However, if let to warm a little while you’re turning the snags you may find some adjuncty sugar, a bit of alcohol and wet Daily Mirror (whoops, Daily Tele - it is 2006 of course). The flavour is definitely not as sweet as I was expecting, but it doesn’t really have much at all there to activate the taste buds before sliding down the throat. All the best if you want to slam down a few tinnies outside in the lunch break before going back inside to watch Lillee and Thomo tear through that flimsy pommy defense. Reasonably pleasant palate, possibly one of the best of the CUB lagers. The carbonation level is quite restrained, and it thankfully doesn’t seem to have that sharp metallic bitterness to finish. In another era this was the staple diet of many Aussie man, dressed in their ruggers and blue bonds singlets and terry towling hats. However, it’s now 2006 so you’re more likely to see ’average’ blokes with Ian Thorpe styled metro-hawks, downing Crownies in their Armani suits talking on their mobile phones after spending all day in front of a computer. Aaahh, KB, thanks for the memories."
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Great beer. One question! I want to know where I can buy it in cases in the Sydney area.
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);In the can. Pours typical Oz golden yellow with a bubbly white head much like most of the other CUB offerings. While this is not the best beer that I’ve ever had, it certainly is no worse than MB or VB. Maybe differs from the others in that it has a slight vegetable flavor in addition to the sugar adjunct. I remember this being available in the states many years ago in the giant oil cans alongside Fosters.
KB Lager;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Old gold can. Not quite as poisonous as VB. Quite sweet with no trace of hops other than a hint of CUB rusty junkyard car panels (although not as bad as usual). Smells like water and has a body to match. I think the best thing it has going for it is that it is innoffensive. Initial taste is strangely reminiscent of alexander keith’s India Pale Ale. Go figure.
Golden Peacock;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Butelka w Indiach 1999r. Kolor jasnosłomkowy,piana słaba, szybko znika. Leeki smak i aromat słodowy, kwaskowe, słodkie alkohol słabowyczuwalny. Piwo słabe. Pite z butelki.
Golden Peacock;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Bottle consumed @ the Polo Bar in Rambaugh Palace, Jaipur. Golden coloured. Unclear.Dense off white head. Swettness, light smoke and fruits in the aroma. Flavour as well is light smoky and has some fruity notes. Has a light herbal touch. Medium bodied. Dry.

Golden Peacock;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);(650ml bottle, Mfg 10/07) Pours a clear pale yellow body with an average white head. Aroma of sweet corn and grain. Flavor of smokiness and corn. My second smoked tasting Indian lager in the past couple days. After spending some time in India, I can just image where it could get this from…
Golden Peacock;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Bottled, acquired and drunk on location, Samudra, Karrela, India. Pale, pale yellow, with a full white head. The pouring….this was the first beer that had without the glycerol in it. The trick with all Indian beer is to tip them upside down in half a glass of water. The glycerol is heavier beer and falls into the water. All beers up to this point had tasted ‘remarkably’ the same. The reason I’ve concluded is 50-100mls of glycerol added as a preservative. Rubbish concept drinking beer like this.
Golden Peacock;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);Wow... this stuff is hard to believe. I just had it on tap in India. I’ll try and keep this brief. The stuff tastes like smoked meat in a very bad way.
Golden Peacock;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);drank from bottle so i could not get a good look at the appearance, it looked golden blonde though. Seamed to have a malty presance too it very heavy on the stomach. Lots of sweet malt character too it with a subtle hops after-taste.
Golden Peacock;Delhi, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mount Shivalik Breweries (Molson Coors India);brewed with german hops. crisp, aromatic, bitter, all the things that beer should be and that indian beer usually is not.

Union Temno Pivo (Črni Baron);Ljubljana, Slovenia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarna Union (Laško);The beer looks lovely. The color of the beer is a very dark brown/ruby red. The beer is to dark to see wether it is clear or cloudy. On top a nice rough layer of almond coloured foam is formed. The bulk of the foam collapses, to leave a thin creamy drape. The smell of the beer is lovely, but not extremely strong. There are some nice stout like aromas. There are nice malty aromas, some liquorice, caramel and some toast. It is both bitter and sweet. There aren’t any clear hops. The taste is a bit stronger than the smell. It is also quite stout-like. Chocolate, liquorice, sweet malts and roasty bitters are all present. All is well balanced. There is a slight hoppy touch. A lovely beer, with a nice stout touch. The palate is good. Medium body, smooth texture and medium light carbonation. The finish is long and has a nice toasty bitterness. Good one.

Union Temno Pivo (Črni Baron);Ljubljana, Slovenia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarna Union (Laško);Bottle, 0.33l. Deep ruby pour, almost black with thin beige layer on top. Smell is woody, grainy and slightly roasted. A bit of toffee in the background. Thin and watery. A bit too heavy on the carbonation, killing the flavors. Roasty bittersweet mouthfeel, slightly smoked. Aroma mostly grainy, slight corn presence. Caramel malts. Roasted. Smoke. Aftertaste reminiscent of wooden barrels, nice. Some metal acidity later on, however not too offensive. Somewhat dry finish. Overall, has potential and plenty of room for improvement. I like the wooden barrel notes and the subtle smokiness. The major downsides here are the lack of body, watery nature and way too aggressive carbonation levels. Not bad.

Aroma’s of cold coffee with sugar in it. In the nose there are hints of cedarwood, roasted malts and nice candy sugar. The taste of this stout is elegant and well in balance. It is not a powerfull stout, but one witch is very drinkable. The afthertaste is light sweet with a fine roasted side and pure finish.
Louwaege Stout;Kortemark, Belgium;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Brouwerij Louwaege (Alken-Maes / Scottish & Newcastle);Bottled. A black beer with practically no head. The smell is very sweet and milky and the taste sweet also. An almost sickly sweet beer probably reminiscent of weak milk stouts of old.
Louwaege Stout;Kortemark, Belgium;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Brouwerij Louwaege (Alken-Maes / Scottish & Newcastle);Loved the super deep red, it pours with a dark red/brown head too, nice. Aroma is sweet roasty flavours, burnt sugar. But the actual flavour is way too sweet, reminded me of a Bolivian piece of work called El Inca, slight black malt flavours, a bit of... have you ever licked a slate floor? a bit of that flavour. Ultimately, too damn sweet and simple.
Louwaege Stout;Kortemark, Belgium;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Brouwerij Louwaege (Alken-Maes / Scottish & Newcastle);BBd is 5/03, so it's still original and another for posterity... Colour is black, with disparate, dark-brown head. nose of sweet molasses, brown sugar and some tobacco. Taste is very sweet, liquorice, like very sugared mocca-coffee with coffee milk. Even with the little head, there is some carbonation which gives a reasonable balance. Mouthfeel is all body, all malt and no alcohol. This is a difficult taste for the usual beerrater, but in its style (sweet stout) it is rather a good one. A slight bitterness in the palate might have improved it, but the balance sweet-sour is OK.

Me, I was like them in that I didn't know what a good beer was until I came to Europe. Unlike them, I realize American beer (Bud, Coors, etc.) is horse piss, which is why American beer needs to be served ice cold. Otherwise, it tastes like horse piss. While not spectacular, Das Shwarze is a decent enough dark beer. Not really strong alcohol-wise, but it has a fine taste, nice color, and very little head. Good to sip, excellent with meals.

It's quite warming and relaxing. After a few more sips, I notice a nutinness and a yeasty flavour in the background; this is a pretty complex brew and I'm enjoying sipping on it.

Abbaye d'Aulne Triple Brune Sur Lie;Gozée, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;"Being Belgian, I am fully aware of the lack of style standards among Belgian ales, but something in my head objects when I see a dark beer named ’triple’, at least if Westmalle Tripel is to be regarded as the prototype of the genre... So in spite of its name, in my classification this NOT a triple. Anyway: yellowish beige head, not very thick and eventually dissipating, colour a pure bronze, clear. Aroma dark malts (caramel, chocolate, hint of coffee), dates, blackcurrant, pear, a slight ’perfume’ of caramel candy, liquorice; mouthfeel smooth, rounded, a bit resinous, tastes sweetish (malt sweetness) with sharp carbonisation in the beginning and warming alcohol in the finish. A bit boring, like most of the ADA beers."

Altenmünster Premium;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Its a lager, what else can I say. Plain and simple, with a bready maltiness, light and somewhat thin body. It is balanced if you can call it that, nothing about it is overly bad, but not that great either.
Altenmünster Premium;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);For a beer that’s made Germany its got a very thin body, aroma is biscuits and bread like. The taste is of malts, fruits and bread. for the casual get together
Altenmünster Premium;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);The aroma is is sweet with sugar, malt, and raisins. The appearance is dark gold with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is way too thin. This one gets points for being a unique lager but it’s still not a good beer.
Altenmünster Premium;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);The 16 ounce bottle poured a slightly hazy light amber beverage with a small fizzy white head that was mostly diminishing and left little or no lacing on the glass. The aroma was interesting, not what I expected from a lager. It had notes of dried dark fruits like prunes and raisins with almost no detectable malt character. The body was medium-light with slightly flat carbonation and a watery texture. The flavor started off semi-sweet with a spicy back-flavor. The finish was a little shorter than I would have liked but there was a light alcohol warmth to the end. My impression was that this beer may not have been fresh. I’ll need to re-rate this at a later time.
Altenmünster Premium;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Interesting fruity nose, with a light bit of fresh flowers. Malt body is quite tasty, fruity with a bit of caramel. Very unique and fresh tasting.
Altenmünster Premium;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Pours a hazy, dirty straw color with a respectable enough head. The aroma is a light fresh bread, a grassy/floral bitterness, and, oddly enough, a touch of chocolate. The flavor’s a dull, sweet malt with a touch of fruit and little of any hopping. Drinkable enough, but this one was enough for me. Friar Tuck Wines, Sprirts, & Beverages, Peoria, IL

Morrells Oxford Blue;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Marston's;Cask (handpump) at the Dog & Gun, Netheravon. As this was badged as Dog & Gun Ale, I rather assumed this was a rebadge of a Stonehenge beer because the pub was selling other beers from that brewery, which is just a few yards down the road. However, the landlord assured me it was Morrells Oxford Blue. I thought they’d stopped making this stuff but obviously not. Its a soft and fruity, slightly sweet, session beer. Not enough bitterness for my taste. Innocuous.

Berliner Kindl Bock Dunkel;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);This is a bock beer I find too sweet. It has a taste of chocolate malt, brown sugar, hard toasted malt and a little nuts. In addition, it tastes a bit of raisin, sweat and dried berries. Unfortunately, it has an excessive sweetness, which in the long run seems to be composed of artificial sweeteners.

Dortmunder Union Export;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Is there anything finer than a chilled, slippery Butterkist and cherry blossom-accented German Lager? Watching the CL and talking shit about beer? Nuanced, sappy and honeyed hop and biscotti notes. Brilliant body and head. Tweaks of spruce. Fresh almond and marzipan right there in the aftertaste way after the swallow. Aroma of floured wine gum, honeyed macaroon, grass sap. Just a trace of bicarb and rubber. But otherwise pristine and lovely to drink. Savagely underrated by fools who don’t understand the joy of being an unabashed LAGER SLUT.

Dortmunder Union Export;Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Dortmunder Actien Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);Pours a clear golden coloration with a large, foamy head and visible carbonation. Smells faintly of sweet, grainy malt, with a hint of grassy hops and hay. Taste follows the nose, with some slightly sweet, grainy malt at the foreground, with faint hints of grassy hops, hay and a certain mineral note. Finishes with a light bitterness and amineral, slightly metallic aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium/lively carbonation. The full, almost creamy mouthfeel is probably the most noteable aspect of this otherwise unremarkable beer dominated by a grainy, mineral, slightly metallic flavor profile and faint, stale grassy hops.

A refreshing heavish lager.

Not worth buying any more, and think I have ancient glassware with DU on it!

Drakes Genuine Stunning Cask;San Leandro, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Drakes Brewing Company;Served foamy via sparkler. It's not flat but close as a casks sometimes are. This dampens the high notes that are screaming to come out. This is like a West Coast ale without gas, literally and figuratively. It's Cascadey, bitter. There's also a mineral quality to the body.
Kelley Brothers Belgian Amber;Manteca, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Kelley Brothers Brewing Company;"What else is in the category ""Belgian Amber""? I guess maybe Palm and Scaldis but this is nothing like them. I'm curious as to what they were trying here. This is a very unique beer and not all bad. Very bitter, dry, slightly sour and intensely and semi-richly citric. I've never had a Belgian with so much hop character and so little yeast character."

Mauritius Zwickauer Bock Dunkel;Zwickau, Saxony, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Mauritius Privatbrauerei;"Bock dunkel de 7,1 % abv, en malt d'orge seul. Mon exemplaire était à 3 mois avant sa date. Couleur roux ambré, à la clarté nette. Bulles fines, vives. Mousse beige, soyeuse, en couronne à la paroi. Arômes de vin rouge de pays, châtaigne, malt cara. 1ère bouche souple, à l'entame vin rouge, feuille de houx, poivron. Arrière-bouche fruitée. 2ème sur vin rouge et feuilles de tomate. Arrière-bouche assez originale, mais peu harmonieuse. 3ème qui perd toute notion d'à-propos. Arrière-bouche fausse, à l'amertume verte. Longueur avec une pointe de tabac blond, mais très mal accordée. Les arrière-bouches sont très courtes. Jambes lisses, courtes. Levure correcte. Alcool qui ne fait pas son niveau, il piétine dès la 2ème bouche et ne peut rien harmoniser. Finale banale. CONCLUSION : une bière qui suscitait au départ des questions sur son centrage, puis qui suscite l'ennui .. c'est assez différent !!

Sweetwater ESB;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sweetwater Brewing Company;"Though retired, this is my take on this well before it was retired. Sorry for the late upload. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was an amber color with a slight transparency about it to allow a decent carbonation to be seen rising into a one finger white foamy head. Once the head died down, there was some thin messy lacing here and there. The smell had a light earthy bittered English maltiness normally construed as ""soapy"" to some but to me I understand what Sweetwater was trying to do. The taste was the English bitter malts. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. The carbonation was there and somewhat smooth and creamy with a gentle breadiness running over my tongue and mouth. Overall, good ESB. Sweetwater did everything they could do with this beer."
Sweetwater ESB;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Pours a clear amber with a thin white hea that leaves very little lacing in the glass.

Sweetwater ESB;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sweetwater Brewing Company;Too bad they retired this one.

Drakson Gold;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;A slightly hazy orange beer with a huge white head. The aroma is very yeasty, but also spicy coriander and some citrus. The flavor is extremely sweet with a very strong presence of the alcohol right from the begining. The alcohol continues its presence all the way, but turns from being tasted, to leave You behind with a warming feeling, not just in the mouth. The flavor also contains notes of coriander, peach, and citrus. The sweetness gives it a slighlty sticky mouthfeel. This should be good to keep the warmth on a winters day.

Nose is rich of roasted malt, coffee, cream, chocolate and touch of fruits. Intial taste of deep roasted malt. coffee, cream and chocolate. Fizzy mouthfeel. Mid palate to finish continues with roasted malt and chocolate. Rich flavor and enjoyable. Light to medium body. Good palate duration and head retention. Sweetness is balanced.
Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;8-13-08 bottle shared with lb4lb thanks to beerlando Dark black pour with a nice creamy tan lasting head. Smell is very nice oats, chocolate bits and roasted malt. Flavor is nice and malty with a nuttiness to it. Very drinkable and not overly sweet. Nice mouthfeel - not too thick or too thin. Dry and yummy.
Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle in trade from beerlando. Thanks man! Pours dark black with a nice tan head. Smell is is coffee and chocolate and roasty malt. Pretty nice. Taste is coffee, cream and a lingering chocolate mocha flavor. Body is about medium to maybe a slight bit rich. Medium carbonation. Nice coffee flavor that hangs around. Pretty nice beer!
Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle. Dark brown pour, no head. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, some sweet cola. I am actually tasting a little grape also, along with cola, chocolate, and some roasted malt. Bitter roast in the finish. It’s just not very good in palate, aroma, or flavor.
Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;bottle from Gasbarro’s Wine and Spirits in Swansea. a beautiful jet black pour with big tan head... that is until i noticed the suspended floaties inside, which slowly settled to the bottom. i was expecting to be knocked over by the coffee in the aroma but instead got grapes and cocoa. robust taste of roasted (bordering on charred) coffee and bittersweet chocolate. i like it. pretty full-bodied with long and dry, yet sticky, finish. this one is as advertised: lots of chocolate and coffee.
Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Thanks to alldaydrinker for this beer. Very dark black pour with thin tan head. Sour grape nose with some light malt aromas. Sweet chocolate flavor with some light mocha, but not nearly the strong flavors I expected. Some metallic bitterness on the finish.
Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"Bottle: This poured with the requisite dark color and tan head, but it is suspiciously laden with chunks of heavy tan sediment as well. The aroma is somewhat fruity, with more of a grapey thing than I’d expect. The flavor is also more intensely sweet than I anticipated. There is an underlying bit of mocha and bitter chocolate, but it does not predominate. As it warms, the finish gets more bitter and tangy. Enjoyable, but as much ""mocha java"" as I’d hoped.

Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours a deep black with an average deep bubbly/creamy tan head that left some spotty lacing. Aroma of coffee grinds, cocoa, roasted malts, some caramel and dark chocolate. Flavor coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malts, picking up some hops and caramel. Well done.
Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours a mocha coffee dark black. Smells chocolate and mocha. Some coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Above average mouthfeel. Nothing outstanding to distinguish this one from other stouts, but quite nicely done. Another fine z-street.
Z Street Mocha Java Stout;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Ipswich Ale Brewery;The beer pours deep brown but has an odd ball almost stale aroma. The dense notes of coffee and bitter chocolate on the palte with more of a malt like finish.
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);355mL can, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Nose is typical swill, with straw and cereal malts. Flavour is pretty uninteresting, with straw and cereal notes. Weak and watery. Typical swill.
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Clear and bright golden. Moderate head with little staying power. Aroma is sweet malt. Taste is lots of bitter hops, mostly. At least the bottle design is cool.
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Even though it's not great, I miss being able to buy this beer in California. It came in 12 packs of 11 ounce bottles with puzzles under the cap that you didn't start to be able to solve until you had a couple beers. Does the current version still have the bottle cap puzzles?
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);This is not a superb beer. It's not even a very good beer. But it is quite decent for cheap beer. It's a good beer for camping and fishing. Most of my rating comes from the nostalgia factor. This was the first beer I drank, in 2002, while sitting in the boat in the middle of Whitefish Lake with my dad's friend when we were out camping. We didn't catch any fish, but it was a good day nonetheless. This is the beer I take out into the wilderness.
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Pale yellow and sweet, goes well paired with some seawater spraying in your mouth. Cheap easy drinker lager better than Labatt or Molson.
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Just because I’m on the Island! On tap. Pours a clear gold with moderate head. Aromas of corn sugar and grain. Flavors of same plus chewy malts. Maybe because it’s fresh and on tap - it’s not as bad as others rate. Can’t say it’s very inspiring tho... Definitely a pounder for after a round of golf on a hot day...
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);The only people who think this beer is an A+ are hicks and inbred’s. Not a bad beer but not great.
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);I’d been eyeing this one at the liquor store for awhile, wondering (or perhaps dreading) what this cheap lager may taste like in comparison to the oodles of other cheap lagers I’ve tried around the world. It pours with a slightly creamy but rather crappy head and heavily carbonated body. Aroma is all corn sweetness, not overbearing or disgusting however. Flavour is soft caramel leaning slightly into cardboard territory with a dry finish. While certainly not great, this is not in the drainpour category and probably isn’t too bad an option for a cheap back porch brew that can be downed by the dozen.
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Draft - Light sweet malts. Clear pale gold with a decent whitehead. Light sweetness and not much else. Lights and wet.
Lucky Lager;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Not necessarily a bad beer, just mass produced and generic. Aroma and flavour of wheats and grains, with little else going for it.

Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;Bouteille de 341 ml achetée dans une LCBO de Ottawa. Dégustée le 23 août 2008. Bière ambrée limpide tirant sur le orange. Mousse assez, col moyen assez durable. Peu effervescente, bulles moyennes. Odeur de sucre brûlé, de caramel. Très douce, assez sucrée, un peu amère en finale. Goût de caramel, de céréales. Très bonne, savoureuse et bien équilibrée, se boit bien.
Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;I wasn’t expecting much from this Amber Lager, a style that can be hit and miss and in Canada, can generally be all over the map. This one pours a clear amber with little head. The aroma is caramel malt with some hops in the air. The flavour is malty with a hint of hops and plums. Unlike some other Amber lagers, this one doesn’t fill you up (ala Alexander Keith’s Red Amber Ale)
Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;341ml bottle pours amber in color with a finger of creamy white head that leaves some thin lacing on the glass. Aroma is light caramel and hops. Taste is caramel matly sweetness with a pleasing hop bitterness in the finish. Light to medium body and ample carbonation. This amber lager was definitely a pleasant surprise.
Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;very strong flavour, bitter, very noticeable aroma compared to most domestics
Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;"Holey crap! This is one awsome brew! Poured a nice thick, solid white head similar to a Caffreys or Kilkenny on tap, nice light amber/orange colour, decent tiny bubble carbonation, floaties that never settle and a decent ammount of brown sediment blobs. Seeing that sediment dump into the glass came as quite the suprise. Produced a consistant solid ring of lacing thoughout the tasting. Aroma is sweet and malty. Something seems odd about the breadiness, so I read the other reviews and I gotta agree with Pootz that its ""musty earthy bread dough"". Nice hops as well. Taste is similar to the smell but is lighter on the breads and comes with a perfectly balanced bitterness. Flavours do not overcome the other qualities of the beer. Mouthfeel is almost medium bodied, extremely smooth with a better delivery than most beers and has a nice creamy soft light bitter finish. I need more of this. I got to say that I had my doubts about this beer, considering that I bought in Dauphin, Manitoba and it was a single (the only one in the store).Excellent beer."
Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;A decent lager. Good hoppiness for a lager. A little citrus as well. Better than most lagers. Worth a try.

Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;I was born drinking walkerville.. It’s a local beer where I live, so it’s fairly easy to come by at events. I had it on saturday at the Greek fest from a keg trailer. it came out a dark orange, with a medium tannish head. The aroma isn’t very strong, but there is a light smell of hops and malt. The taste is where it’s at, strong hops and a nice sweetness. I’ll buy it from now on, but it’s difficult to come by.
Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;Bottle. Amber colour with sparse head. Aromas of mainly malt, yeast and a little fruit. Medium-light mouthfeel with corn and slight hop aftertaste. Nothing terribly different.
Walkerville Classic Amber Lager;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Walkerville Brewing Company;Pours an orangey amber with no head. Aroma is almost non existant, mostly just malty sweetness. Flavour is not bad, some graniness, malts, a tidbit of hops. It’s an OK beer, if nothing else, its atleast refreshing.
Walkerville Premium Blonde;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Walkerville Brewing Company;This is far and away the best of the Walkerville beer line. A nice clear golden ale with a short-lived white head. The aroma was grainy malt with a nice splash of hops on the nose. The flavour was refreshing with a nice malt bite followed by a bitter finish.

Walkerville Premium Blonde;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Walkerville Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of GregClow.

Watery flavour is lightly vegetal with some mild grassy hops, bready malt and a quick light bitter finish. Average bodied. A little too carbonated for my liking. Meh, it’s not bad but it’s only average at best.
Walkerville Premium Blonde;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Walkerville Brewing Company;As said previously, pale yellow, frothy, finishes with a hop flavour, goes great with fish.

Walkerville Premium Blonde;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Walkerville Brewing Company;Bottle - 341ml. Boring golden body with good carbonation and a thin white frothy head. Fair malty aroma with bready and herbal notes. Its malty/hoppy taste is rather thin and lacks complexity. Finish is almost non-existent. Far from my idea of a good Pilsner.
Walkerville Premium Blonde;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Walkerville Brewing Company;pale gold color, not much aroma, slight corn notes, and a tad bit of malt. Mouthfeel is pretty thin, and wattery. meh, nothing special.

Mild aroma; sweet malt, maybe a little grainy. Very smooth, nicely carbonated. Not a lot to it, in terms of taste; malt, just a little hop flavour near the end. A little sweet. Not much finish. Not bad, for an Ontario pilsener. Great summer beer."
Walkerville Premium Blonde;Walkerville, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Walkerville Brewing Company;Lightly hazed golden lager with a thick creamy white head.

Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;Originally rated December 2004. Sampled at Vineyards in Ottawa. Poured a dark colour with red highlights and a brown head with spots of lacing. Aromas were of coffee and had quite a bitter scent. The taste was slightly bitter with a mild chocolat finish. Also, there was a small fruity taste to the mouth. Mouthfeel was smooth and slightly creamy.
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;341 ml bottle from the brewerry, thanks to Tupalev. Pours dark brown, a little cloudy. Aroma and taste are very sweet, chocolately, and a pretty good dose of raisin like sweetness. Good!
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;341 mL bottle from the brewery. Almost black, with a nice brown head. A healthy amount of bittersweet dark chocolate in the aroma, with some underlying roast. Pretty much the same goes for the flavour. Creamy mouthfeel is slightly hindered by carbonation that’s a touch higher than it needs to be. Nothing exciting, but it is well done. Much better than last time I had one of these.
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;341 ml bottle from tupalev. this is my third bottle of the 3 i got from jeff and each was a little different. pours black with a mid tan head that quickly reduces. muted chocolate aroma, very small but pleasent. flavour is thin but enjoyable. chocoalte and coffee notes. body is thin. ok for a session porter but ive had many better porters in my day. the 3 scores for the 3 bottles ive had would have been: 2.9, 3.9, 3.4. thats shows there is quite a bit of inconsistancy from this brewer.
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;341ml bottle thanks to Tupalev, thanks Jeff! Pours a totally viscous brown into my snifter, with a small mocha-tanned head. Aroma is very sweet and roasty, chocolatey, hearty malts, robust, nice! Flavour is very rich, roasty malts balanced quite well with sweet chocolate malts. Dry roast finishes out the show very nicely. Maybe just a little bit fizzy, but I’m pretty sure there’s some yeast sediment in there that helps out boosting the body. Almost reminds me of PC Decadent chocolate chip cookies (my own weird interpretation). Very well done! Too bad it’s so damn hard to get stuff from this brewery. A top-notch, bang-on example of this style IMHO.
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;"20oz draught 8.0% ABV The 8.0% ABV was clearly written on the keg. I tried this beer on January 11, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe’s"" in Toronto. The beer poured a brownish black with a finger thick tannish creamy head. The aroma was a mixture of roasted malts and chocolate. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, creamy, and medium carbonation. The taste was definitely chocolatey. The alcohol, while not tasted, was certainly felt."
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;Deep brown body, medium tan head. Strong roasted malt aroma with touches of coffee and dark chocolate. Thin, somewhat sour, acidic body, with chocolate (Hershey’s syrup) and roasted malt, neither too sweet nor too dry, but somewhat unpleasant. The remainder tastes like stale toast, the kind that was burned and left on the counter for several hours. A disappointing beer.
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;"(341 ml bottle: Obtained 24-Mar-06 in trade with blankboy, thanks Paul!) Pours a dark walnut brown body topped by a small, tan head. The aromas of nuts and roast quickly greet my nose, but contrary to my expectations, it doesn’t smell too much like chocolate. Fairly roasty flavor too, kind of nutty, perhaps a bit yeasty. Somewhat chocolaty in the finish I suppose, but it’s more a baker’s chocolate, definitely very little sweetness here. Moderate bitterness. Body is medium-full and doesn’t thin out one bit in the finish. Rather dry on the palate, and carbonation is gentle. Head retention is nothing special, settling to a sparse, filmy layer, and lacing is minimal as well. Overall, a pretty easy drinking porter, decent and enjoyable, but not nearly as ""decadent"" as the name would imply. They set the bar far too high with that name and the beer can’t follow through."
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;Deep read near black pour with a tan bubly thick head. Berry and chocolat scent. Very rich mocha chocolat taste. Malty and earty with a lingering aftertaste that lasts. Foud a bit of nut in the finish as well. The best Church Key I have had.
Church-Key Chocolate Porter;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Church-Key Brewing;341ml brown bottle from gilvanblight. Poured deep dark brown, head was sparse, tan in colour.

Maximiliaan Kloosterbier;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Dubbel;Brouwhuis Maximiliaan;Dark, malty. Fairly tasty, but perhaps a little bit too yeasty to bang with the big boys from 't IJ.
Maximiliaan Winterwarmer;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwhuis Maximiliaan;Rated the 2002 version from tap! Wine and grape aroma. Hazy, red/brown, rocky head, fair lacing. Sweet, light gluhwein spices (which gives it a very special character), full and warm. Long hopbitter and spicy finish.
Maximiliaan Maximator;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Brouwhuis Maximiliaan;Lactic and oak aroma. Cloudy, brown color, small off-white head, diminishes fast. Starts off lactic, later more sweet, some spices, watery. Short finish. I think the cask was old and I hope to re-rate it some time.

Rich grainy heat and coriander aroma. Softly malty with vanilla flavour. Clean with salty and unusually bitter finish for a witbier. Wonderful nose and malt profile, but lacking in complexity.
Maximiliaan Speltbier;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Brouwhuis Maximiliaan;Beautiful aroma: honey, citrus and fresh wheat. Taste has a hint of sourness and honey, orange and some yeastiness. Late hopbitterness and a bit of licorice.

Maximiliaan Speltbier;Amsterdam, Netherlands;Specialty Grain - Other;Brouwhuis Maximiliaan;Vaguely a witbier by style, but made with unusual grains. This has an interesting dryish flavour to go along with the sweet malt and citric notes common to the style.
Bluegrass Black Sunshine;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft: I just got back from this place. A very nice combination of a stout and a dubbel. They call it a Belgian stout. I was pleasntly surprised after tasting this fine beer. Chocolatey and estery with dark fruit and Belgian yeast overtones.
Cest What Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;Tap at C'est What. Pours black with creamy brown head. Huge amount of coffee, with some chocolate and roasted malts. Very low carbonation, with dry finish. Not bad.
Cest What Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;"Tap at C’est What. Translucent dark ruby-ish brown; fast-dropping creamy head with rather thick lace. The aroma is pretty much like cold coffee, with roasty-toasty malts behind that but not much else. Not that there’s anything more I want. Tastes of sweetish coffee, roasty; finishes very dry. Flattish mouthfeel with little and thin carbonation (yet not without a certain crispness). An honest, no tricks coffee Stout. Decent."
Cest What Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;Tap. Kind of disappointing black pour with minimal head. Decent chocolate and coffee aromas in the aroma. Mildly milky/creamy, easy finish, oily, malty backing. Solid.
Cest What Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;On tap at C’est What. Brown with mocha head. Some roasted malt and chocolate but muted, mild body and moderate carbonation, easy to drink but somewhat thin, leaves a bit of a chalky coffee taste on the palate.
Cest What Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;Way too much espresso on the nose here and not enough beer in the whole affair. Pours black with creamy mocha head and great lacing. Really not many porter characteristics. Light sour finish with some bitterness. C’est What Festival.

Cest What Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;On tap at C’est What? Pours a dark brown with a thick tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate. Flavor brings out roasted coffee, hazelnut, with a nice roasted malt backbone and sweet finish. It could have a little more coffee, although the coffee notes are present. It just left me wanting a little more. 7/4/7/4/14 [3.6/5]
Cest What Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;"Draught at C’est What, Toronto Black color, with no head. Both aroma and flavor remind of cheap coffee; the mouthfeel is weak and dry; ordinary bitterness."

The flavour was chocolate, roast, and coffee and was very smooth. A very enjoyable beer."
Cest What Homegrown Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Tastes a little grainy, possibly from the hemp seeds. Pours cloudy blonde with ok head and lacing. Finish sweet and crisp grainy. Not super exciting. Tap at C’est What Festival
Cest What Homegrown Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Not a bad beer. The hemp comes through mostly in the mouthfeel. A little bit hoppy, otherwise unremarkable.
Cest What Homegrown Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;No scent at all. Wasn’t sure If it was just me so had my wife smell it. Taste is much stronger that he scent.

Cest What Homegrown Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;On tap at C’est What. Orange pour, little head. Slightly sour, kind of a granola texture and dusty, grainy aroma.

Cest What Homegrown Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;341 ml bottle from The Beer Store. Pours a clear golden orange with decent-sized white head. Aroma of somewhat sour grains, caramel and a little spiciness. Flavour has both sweet and sour notes with interesting graininess, lightish caramel and a herbal spiciness. Average carbonation and body. Nice.
Cest What Homegrown Hemp Ale;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Cest What;Originally rated January 2006. This Canadian hemp beer pours a hazy golden colour with a medium white head. Lightly carbonated, with fast dissipation and good lace. The leftover that tops the brew is quite nice with bubbles, patches and streaks. The aroma is strong at first, with some bitterness, and then, grain cereal malt. Caramel malt in the mouth, with some kind of sourness in the middle. Hints of chocolat malt as well, and some bread. Well brewed, but nothing over-existing. All hemp beers I have tried so far seem to have an outdated sourness to them, and I am not fond of that. Found at the LCBO Depot on Bank street in the south of Ottawa.

The beer poured a translucent light amber colour with a thin white head. The aroma was spicy, some caramel, and some citrus and grains. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour a weak balance between sweet caramel notes and citrusy hops."
Bluegrass Krystal Weisse;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Ya, a weird one here - a little too much sweet malt in the cheap corn/rice feel. Clear filtered beverage with a thick foamy head that clears. Spicy yeasty notes.
Bluegrass Krystal Weisse;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Makes you wonder how they make such good beers and such awful ones. They are way off on this one. Aftertaste of a budweiser and a very unpleasant, dominant, funky malt finish. I respect them for at least trying a rare style, but this is disastrous.

Valhalla Valkyrie Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;"Pretty miserable.

Nothing bad here, just nothing, with a very light yellow body."

Valhalla Valkyrie Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;Clear dark straw. Sticky bleach white head. Toasty and clean. Quite malty. Minimal hops and lightly bitter. Light body. Very inoffensive, even for macro drinkers.
Valhalla Valkyrie Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;quite a substantial beer for a light lager. just the right amount of hops, not a full bodied a the valhalla pilsner. still worth a try
Clancys Harvest Ale;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moosehead Breweries;This beer surprised me. Moosehead? Well, well, they actually can make beer with flavor over there. Dry fruit, some malt and a nice hop bite. For a macro, this was amazing.
Clancys Harvest Ale;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moosehead Breweries;Pours out a deep amber color. Short-lived head, fading to lacing around the rim of the glass. Fruity aroma, with plenty of maltiness in the front of this beer. Smooth mouthfeel, with subtle hops to it. A well balanced beer in my book. Hard to find outside of Canada makes it a beer worth seeking out. All in all, a really good amber ale.
Clancys Harvest Ale;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moosehead Breweries;Really nice deep amber color. Sort of a weaker head, but nice lacing. Different flavor, more bitter and robust than Clancy's Amber, with a fruitier aroma. Goes down very easily. Would go very good with a large homecooked meal, say at Thanksgiving :-) A winner in my books.
Clancys Harvest Ale;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Moosehead Breweries;Has a little different taste then Clancy's other Ale but still good/ maybe even better

Settles as thin layer of foam unable to cover the surface of the beer. No Lacing. Aroma is moderately intense. Sweet malts and Corn. Salty notes. Some sour sharp notes rummaging in the background. The usual sweetish pale lager experience. Light carbonation. Thin, watery, lightly tingling texture. Flavor is quite sweet, a little salty. followed by a moderate sourish bitterness.

Bosman Specjal;Warszawa, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlsberg Polska;I am unsure what was special about that one. Maybe the use of that large amount of alcohol when brewing a simple industrial beer. You find only some sweets, grains and malt in it. Drinkable. Yes.

Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);The aroma has paper, grains, and tinny hops. The appearance is amber gold with a thin clumpy head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall the beer is clearly old but it held up pretty good considering how lowly this beer really is.
Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Golden in color with lazy carbonation and no appreciable head, this has an oddly pungeunt sweet malt aroma... not offensive, but odd. A sweet malt drink with very little hopping, this nonetheless doesn’t taste that bad. It ends with a mildly bitter, alcoholic finish.
Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Bottle: Aroma is malty and somewhat skunky. Kind of smells like your basic pale lager with more malts. Pours a transparent gold with a small white head and some sediment floating around. Very malty taste. Very sweet. Very little hops. Basically tastes like a very sweet pale lager. I don’t see it on the bottle, but according to the website this is 7%. Alcohol is covered up very well. Sweetness completely masks the alcohol.
Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);crispy malt on the nose, pale straw color and crystal clear. lots of carbonation, and tastes lightly malty and very clean. maltier on the nose than in the mouth, but overall pretty refreshing.

Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Compared to the Russian lagers I've been drinking tonight, this Polish lager is a touch crisp by comparison and is also lighter on the malt (ie. more like a US lager). Fairly fizzy and with 7% abv, you do get some kick out of drinking this big bottle. Though I'm not a fan of the two other Dojlidy's I've tried, this Mocne is acceptable, if not noteworthy. Tastes of cardboard soaked in ethyl alcohol.
Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Very light in colour, almost pale. A slightly malty aroma with a slightly hoppy scent. Decent lager, not too bad, somewhat metallic tasting. A thin body, but definately drinkable! Bought in Hamtramack in Detroit, MI.
Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Blone with a cream head and a moderately malty aroma with just a slightly corn syrupy quality, this was the most drinkable european strong longer I have tested, to date. The body was fairly well balanced in a similar fashion to how the aroma would indicated. Mild maltiness and mostly inoffensive sweetness.
Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);The pour a lustrous gold color, the head bright white, frothy in texture, the head impressive in size, with the leftover lace a fine coating to seal off the glass. Nose is clean and fresh, malt dominated, as is the start also a tad sweet, the top skinny in its feel to the palate. Finish has a pertinent hop bite, the carbonation light to moderate, the aftertaste quite dry, just an “Average “Lager/Pils, with a bigger ABV, which does nothing for the beer.
Dojlidy Mocne;Poznan, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Light, somewhat malty, but also somewhat bland. A decent beer that is pretty refreshing.

Black Oak Nutcracker;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Black Oak Brewing;Pours a thick, dark brown color with dark brown head. Excellent roasted malt, dark fruit and coffee nose.

Medium to strong strength finish, ending with a burnt sugary smoky earthy spicy feel. Overall pretty fine craft. Well balanced, tasty flavors, although a little flat and lacking freshness.

Black Oak Nutcracker;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Black Oak Brewing;"""strong"" being a relative term in terms of a 5.5 percent brew, well sure I ain’t compliancin’ but it sure don’t seem likes a ""strong"" in my books..... how’mnever we do understand that Ontarians have a constitutional weakness compared to the rest of the world, whereas they just can’t handle things like reality and relativity relative to the rest of the country and/or planet we’s done lives in.....nonetheless I’s got some okay beige head here and brown body, average at best methinks. Aroma is sweet coffee, carrotcake, barley, pumpkin, kinda meh. Flavour is a lot of roasted barley with a decent dry finish, but it’s dry and carrot-y and not complex at all..... which leads me to believe that some may rave over it, but again it’s not the kinda beer I’d advise you to buy a plane ticket to go find. It’s all right, fo sho, no complaints (well, a few) but it’s not a spectacular mess. And at aroond 2000 ratings, that’s exactly what I’m looking for - can’t imagine reviewing all these middling beers for the next decade, sounds like boredom incarnate. Get me some godlike stuff that I can take to the grave, or get outttathaway. Amen, and all that."
Black Oak Nutcracker;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Black Oak Brewing;Draught at The Craft Brasserie. Roasted malt, cocoa, dried fruit, touch of spice, mildly nutty, fairly dry finish. Don’t really get much cinnamon but otherwise a decent porter, if not slightly overhyped.
Black Oak Nutcracker;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Black Oak Brewing;A big coffee nose on a near-black body with a thin tan head. A really nice and relatively rich porter for 5.8% abv. Taste profile leads with café au lait, supported by some semi-sweet chocolate and a touch of cherries. Not getting any cinnamon here. A nice creamy mouth feel and relatively dry finish make this a winner.
Black Oak Nutcracker;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Black Oak Brewing;Bottle, shared with my father in law. Very dark brown, tan head. Rich and fudgey, flavours of chcoclate and light coffee.

Flat Branch Maibock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;10 ounce pour atthe brewpub. Amber hue. Not a big aroma but maltsand a little fruit. The flavor is malt dominated and it tastes a little hot. Gentle fruit.
Flat Branch Maibock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Tasted 9/10/07. Growler from the brewpub. Filtered with a hue that tapers from amber to golden. Spotty white head. Slight citrus and bready aromas. Mild to medium bodied. Bright and citrusy and slightly soapy. Off dry with subtle fruity nuances. Peppery hops. Good woody sticky flavor. Solid.
Flat Branch Maibock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;<!-- i -->Draft<!-- /i -->: Beaming copper. Dusty-white foam nestles into a thin, but creamy, layer of rockiness. Balanced aniseed, lemon cake, and bread crust aromas. Inkling of minerals and buttered caramel. Coarse carbonation. Seductively soft wave of toffee-drizzled hay and bready Munich immediately takes foothold and allays the initial graininess. Spicy hops punctuate the vividly defined toastiness of the malt, with a scratchy bitterness. Flash of acidity arises, but due to the rich malts, it doesn’t detract. Juicy kiss of floral hops and deliciously sweet pockets of caramelized sugar lie sandwiched within. Multilayered malts possess more than enough fluffiness to soften the body’s minerally firmness. Complementary salty bitterness is enhanced by a well-established blend of banana nut bread and vibrant malt flavors. The aroma isn’t the cleanest, but the purity and extraction of the malts make this a standout.
Flat Branch Maibock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Tap - My new favorite although I haven’t tried them all yet. Poured a dark amber with a little head. Tasted really good with a hint of caramel.
Flat Branch Maibock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;"Draft pint at the brewpub, 5/11/06: Big malty aroma. Dark and shiny red-amber with a thin cloudy head. Caramel malt started it off, finishing with a tangy apple-bite. Almost a pinch of smoky peat there somewhere? All quite subtle; a pretty mellow drinker."
Flat Branch Maibock;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;A fine malty maibock, leaves a creamy lace in my glass. I had 8 of these one night.

Lech Premium;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Złociste, klarowne, piana dobra jak na koncernowego lagera, jako tako się trzyma, zostawia trochę lacingu. Aromat i smak słodowy, słodki, z lekkim dmsem. Pod koniec, po ogrzaniu zaczyna też śmierdzieć podłym alkoholem. Warka do 15/01/20 dla Pol'and'Rock 2019, 5% alk. Przynajmniej puszka ładna.
Lech Premium;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Puszka. Bardzo pozytywne zaskoczenie. Najmniej wadliwy eurolager z próbowanych w czasie pięciodniowego spływu kajakowego. Najmniej wadliwy = najmniej jakichkolwiek doznań smakowych. Fucking close to water. W tym przypadku to może akurat komplement.
Lech Premium;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Pours clear golden with a thick white head. Aroma of acerbic malt. Taste has honey, sweet malt and pilsen notes to it. Palate has the slightest hint of hops that I would consider detectable. Not the worst cheap beer.
Lech Premium;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);500ml can. Clear greenish blonde with a foamy white head. Flavors are cereals with fruity and stale notes. Light to medium body, moderate to good carbonation, smooth texture.
Lech Premium;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Color amarillo dorado, cristalina. Dos dedos de espuma con retención media. Aroma discreto a cereal y cartón. Gusto ligero a cereal, maíz y un puntillo metálico, ligero amargor. Cuerpo acuoso. Nada memorable pero un día de calor te puede sacar de un apuro.
Lech Premium;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);A light lager beer, this one is another refreshing brew from the lands of Poland. Best enjoyed when chilled strongly, and it is the best refreshing option because of its high levels of carbonation.
Lech Premium;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);W aromacie trawiastość, nuty zbożowe. W smaku puste, bardzo nijakie, jakieś tam ważywka, trochę zbóż. Pijalność średnia, Ciężkawe. Ogólnie bardzo słabo
Lech Premium;Poznan, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kompania Piwowarska (Asahi);Ma dobro, teško da bi itko očekivao nešto više od ovakve pive. U rangu naših lagera, ali lijepo je tu i tamo popiti koju poljsku pivu!

Rondeur moyenne-mince en bouche avec un pétillement moyen et une texture aux notes huileuses et asséchantes. Goût de grains de céréales avec, un léger goût fruité (agrumes, faibles notes de cantaloup) et des notes épicées (poivre doux, traces de coriandre) lors de l’entrée en bouche auquel se rajoute un goût malté de caramel doux aux notes rôties avec un léger goût de pain grillé puis en finale, une légère amertume de houblon herbeux asséchante est présente avec des notes de noix. Post-goût moyen et légèrement sec, léger-moyen amer de houblon herbeux avec des notes de noix et d’épices.
L'Amère à Boire Oktoberfest;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;On tap at the pub (where else?!?). Nice dar copper pour with a thin veil of white foam. Aroma is quite malty, very nutty, something very much lie pumpkin as well (the fruit, not the spices), some light peppery hop notes. Taste is sweet, malty, nutty, strong caramel finish and a bit peppery. Palate feels pretty heavy, with medium carbonation. Not as quaffable as some of their other lagers, but certainly a good beer.
L'Amère à Boire Oktoberfest;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;Bonne effervescence. Caramel brûlé dans l’arôme et le goût avec une finale d’amertume légèrement florale. Elle libère même des notes de muscade en respirant. Fini assez sec, très facile à boire.
L'Amère à Boire Oktoberfest;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;A reddish copper beer with a thin lacing and creamy moka head. In aroma, nutty and grassy malt with light candy cinnamon notes. In mouth, a good biscuitty malt with light roasted notes, caramel, quite pleasant, medium bodied. On tap at brewpub, Sept. 25 2010.
L'Amère à Boire Oktoberfest;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;On tap at L’Amere à Boire. The color is amber with a white head .The taste is sweet and malty but not to sweet for that kind of beer. It was an easy beer to drink on the terrasse on a nice October day.
L'Amère à Boire Oktoberfest;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;"Another beer that makes you sort of lose faith in beer ratings (not that I’ve had any in a long time). I think the biggest crime is that a quick scan of the ten most recent ratings comes back with, I believe, zero negative comments. And in fact, most of the raters comment on how ""drinkable"", ""pleasant"", ""enjoyable"" the beer is. Yet look at the scores. It’s as if people are afraid to rate a beer highly because someone might say ""Oh my god, you gave a random octoberfest above a 4!!??"". I don’t know. It’s just sad, and a very good example of why the BJCP system, with all its problems, has many advantages to this scoring system. Not only is this a flawlessly brewed beer, and definitely one of the most authentic examples outside of Germany, but it also has a wonderful flavor and aroma, with perfect marzen yeast character (light tin, nuts, yellow/red fruit notes) and a subtle, delicate hoppiness (that perks up retronasally). The malt is well-attenuated, but leaves just enough caramel/toffee sweetness to keep it from being thin, while the texture is supple and fluid, going down easily. An outstanding beer in all aspects, from one of the best (though I wish they were experimental) brewers around."
L'Amère à Boire Oktoberfest;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;"Pint at brewpub. SE13/07. App.: Orange-amber, clear, remnants of an off-white head. Aroma: Malty and sweet, some crystal mal, a bit of caramel, lightly fruity; a bit “homebrew mashy”. Palate: Medium body and medium-low carbonation. Flav.: Some decent, chewy caramel and toffee malts, slightly oxidized, some mash notes (remind me of celery seed); a touch of bitterness to balance the slight sweetness. OK, but not really for me. Would probably taste better in Muenchen."
L'Amère à Boire Oktoberfest;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;Copper-brown body with a small off-white head. Rather simple but pleasant blend of cereals, roasted malt, light caramel, and some cooked vegetables. Light and easy to drink. I wish I had taken more notes because I can’t remember any more than that. But it’s not surprising, Oktoberfest and foggy memory always go together.
L'Amère à Boire Oktoberfest;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;Draught. Dark copper with a small white head. The aroma is bready and toffee-ish.

L'Amère à Boire Fin de Siècle;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;Has soft peachy notes on the nose, appearance is a little head and a clear copper body. Flavour is meaty and nutty and surprisingly few hoppy notes. Crisp finish. It’s a decent brew and not a total hop overload like some IPA’s.
L'Amère à Boire Fin de Siècle;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;Robe sombre, et nez fruité classique d’une bière typé IPA. En bouche les notes maltés laissent place aux fruits exotiques, puis à l’amertume. Assez moyen et basique dans le genre.
L'Amère à Boire Fin de Siècle;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;Une mousse de consistance moyenne mais entêtée laisse une jolie traînée de dentelle derrière elle lorsqu’elle disparaît de la bière cuivrée et assez claire. Un léger caramel très agréable soutient des notes herbacées et poivrées au nez. Une belle rondeur maltée ne vient toutefois pas aliéner les saveurs houblonnées qui sont plutôt herbacées et terreuses. Une belle amertume se glisse en finale. Une superbe IPA à l’anglaise.
L'Amère à Boire Fin de Siècle;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;Dark amber. Decent head. Very wood dry ESB. Paired with a good meal and good company.
L'Amère à Boire Fin de Siècle;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;oh god an english pale ale. Way too many nonflavors going on here. Light water could be the best descriptor? Some malts, not much. No hops at all.
L'Amère à Boire Fin de Siècle;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;Pouah c’est trop sucré avec une amertume collante et dure. Je sais pas si les IPA d’avant ressemblais à ça mais je préfère les versions modernes!

L'Amère à Boire Fin de Siècle;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Brasserie Artisanale L'Amère à Boire;On tap @ L’Amere A Boire. Clear orange/amber pour with white foam. Garbage malty IPA. A lot of caramel, grass, and pine. Slight orange rind, I suppose. Tastes like candied apples and caramel sauce. Bitter grass, pine, and citrus rind. A lot of toasted bread and malts. A little too malty and sweet. And by a little, I mean completely.
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Big off-white head and has a reddish brown color. Very earthy malty aroma. There is a good amount of hops in this for an amber ale. Palate is pretty light and maybe has a little too much carbonation. Parts of the beer are kind of soapy. Plus I got this beer for 5 bucks a sixer. Maybe the bottle was quite old.
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours an amber color with a large foamy off white head with some suspended particulates. Nose is hoppy, earthy, touch of grass, fruits, caramel. Initial taste is earthy, toffee, citrus. Mid palate to finish develops that piney sharp hop balance with a touch fruits and malt backbone. Palate duration is above average. Good head retention. Medium body. Very drinkable probably my favorite amber ale so far.
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"Bottle; poured a nice looking auburn/amber color with medium sized off white head. Aroma was nice with herbal, biscuit, citrus and caramel/toffee elements. Pretty good for the style, especially since this style is normally hard to distinguish for me. Good amount of pine citrus/hop finish with caramel, malty backbone. Palate is slightly chewy."
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;rust colored body with a nice light brown head.as the head sits it leaves thick webbing on the glass.the aroma is of ice tea,biscuits,and pine hops.flavor is a mix of rust,biscuits,caramel malts,and grass.maybe this is an older bottle cuz i dont pick up much hops.
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;(12oz bottle) Pillowy medium beige head with good retention and nice lacing, atop lightly hazed copper body. Aroma is moderately sweet, toffee, nut, caramel, orange/floral, some cherry/bread, chocolate. Taste is medium sweet, grapefruit, tea, caramel, some orange. Medium body, light chewiness, acidity. A top-notch amber.
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle. Poured a rusty shade with quite the big poofy head. Nice aroma of caramel malt wafts thru the barrier. The beer delivers with a nice toasty, sweet maltiness. Just a glimmer of bitter kiss at the end to balance out with the maltiness. I agree with their blurp, this would go well with a burger. (#3149, 10/21/2007)
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours deep amber with a medium head. This beer shows notes of yeasty maly with nice notes of carmel. These flavors show on the palate with decent amount of light bitterness. One of the best amber that I have had in a long time.
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;A very nice amber. Reddish with a little white head. Initially creamy yeasty and full bitter finish, with some toasty malt in the background.
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;bottle from bmartin08...I was shocked at much I enjoyed this beer, I’m not normally a fan of ambers, but the hops on this one caught me off guard! Very pleasant dry hopped taste/aroma, would definitely buy again if it were available by me
Z Street Rollstone Red;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottle. Pours a deep red with an off-white head. Scents of faint hops and some malt on the nose. Malt and thick caramel start at the beginning as it bitters into the finish. It smoothed out as it warmed but was a bit ragged in the beginning.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);12-ounce bottle pours clear auburn with a spritz of tan head and lacing. Aroma: port wine, cherries, brown sugar, dark dried fruits. Flavor: brown sugar, caramel, figs, dates, nuts, brown bread, toast, black pepper. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied, nicely balanced bittersweet finish.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);I'm not the biggest fan of super hoppy beer, but to me this is well balanced tasting enough for me. Very nice red color, good body, good balance of malty and hoppy flavors. Doesn't get a super high score from me because I'm not the biggest on hoppy beers, but this has a nice spicy hop flavor to it that doesn't overpower things for me.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On Tap - the 024 - Exceptionally balanced, big hops mellowed by grain. Copper hue. Great body, Spicy and dry, with a faintly sweet malt backdrop.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pours ruby red. The aroma is mainly of caramel malt. It tastes of sweet caramel malt with, surprisingly given the ibu listed here, minimal hops bitterness. It's full bodied and pretty good, but not great.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);12floz bottle BBD: 11.11.2018, (I had a few days before and after, it was fine) $12 four-pack, pint glass. After the pour the head does.not tend to stick around long.to cover the dark amber body, which effuses a candies caramel aroma. For a beer of some heft, it strikes a good balance between hop bitterness and malty sweetness. Wood, caramel, and dried fruit are all part of this full-bodied ale's menagerie of flavors. It serves right there with Stone's Arrogant Bastard as standards for the American strong ale style.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);The smoothest Imperial red on the planet. Caramel notes and a fair amount of hops. One of the best Imperial Reds I have had.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Great Lakes simply brews great beer! Fresh on tap, this poured a solid and impressive deep amber-red with plentiful lacing topped with creamy thick white foam. Rich aroma of burnt caramel, sweet licorice, fruity hops, almost has a blood orange-citrusy zing to it, very complex and appetizing. Decadent and chewy caramel maltiness is predominant in the flavor, although there’s a bracing earthy and herbal hop bitterness that cleans the palate from the caramel. Finishes with a noble hop herbal bitterness. Medium-full bodied, this is a filling imperial red ale that seems like it would overwhelm any food you could pair with it. Savor a full pint of this by itself and take in all the intense flavor. Best imperial red ale I can recall trying.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Gorgeous blood red pour. Aroma is a bit scant. Pretty well balanced for a brew with a higher ABV. Not as hoppy as I'd imagined it would be. Thinner mouthfeel. Probably will have again. Draft @ Cafe Lulu, Milwaukee.
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Nose is so good the thin flavor is s sad surprise. Aftertaste is thin licorice. Disappointing. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Great Lakes Nosferatu;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Imperial;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Bottle. Copper amber color. Floral hops, caramal malt, toffee, bubblegum. Medium body. Good hop and malt balance. Creamy texture. Bitter finish. But smooth and enjoyable.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;On Tap. Standard Oktoberfest. Malt, spice with a bit of apple taste. This did have a hoppy after taste which seems to be a Paper City signature. Nothing special, but if you like this style you may like this one. I’m not big into this style but it is the season,so I will try what I can hoping for something exceptional.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;bottle poured an amber in color with good initial carbination settling down with a thin head. smell is malts, caramel, spice, and is lightly sweet. taste is medium on the mouth feel, caramel malt on the tongue, and finishes slightly dry with a slight bitterness. decent beer, perhaps the style is not my favorite either.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;Swet malt in the aroma.Pours medium copper with a white head.Flavor is the same as the aroma.Mouthfeel is thin to medium with a sweet malt finish.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;Light fruit and a definite sweet malt aroma come from the copper colored body. The palate is thin to medium. Sweet caramel malt makes up the majority of the flavor--and even though this is one dimensional--that one dimension is done well.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;12oz bottles acquired in trades with jpm74 & ppoitras (thanks!). Poured a medium and slightly hazy amber color with an averaged sized off white head. Initial whiffs gave me a strong caramel smell. I then picked up juicy apples and some toasted malts. Tastes of toasted malts, lighter caramel, toffee, and a lighter (well, lighter than the aromas) apple fruitiness. Caramel apples come to mind. I guess I’ll go against the majority as I actually liked this one.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;"Bottle... Clear, light amber lager with a small, creamy, off-white head. Rich, toasted aroma with notes of caramel and nuts. The flavor is malty and rich, but crisp; moderately sweet, but also moderately bitter. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Mid-length, seared caramel, gently bitter finish. This one definitely improved as it warmed. Thank you jjpm74 for sending this one my way!"
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;Bottle. Pours a clear orangey red with a nice tuft of a head. Nose is fruity with malts. This is a clean and crisp brew, but just doesn’t have enough flavor to make it work. Sweet caramels mixed in with the fruit are just not enough.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;Pours copper with a white head. Smells of caramel and pine. Taste is malty with some nice hoppy undertones.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;Bottle, from Julio’s. Best by 01/27/06, got that covered. Ok nose, sweet. Yeasty/sourdough, little egg/sulphur, caramel, apple. Clean brownish orange color, small head that faded to a ring. Sweet flavors, like aromas with a little spice and pumpkin kickin around. Medium body, lite oily creamy mouthfeel, , sweet dry finish. Eh, i don’t know. I think its a style I’ll never get excited about.
Paper City Summit House Oktoberfest;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Paper City Brewery;Clear copper with a small head attributed by the person pouring from the tap. Aroma is butterscotch and sweet hops. Taste is malty, maple, fall leaves and toffee. Creamy mouthfeel and just the right amount of crbonation. I’d like to see a bit more hop kick but oh well. Sweet flavors.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;Smells like a frosted donut. Slight sweetness in nose and flavor. This is a good pale ale with some thickness, and also bitterness through the end.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;Draft @ North Peak brewpub. Hazy orange colour, off-white head. Aroma is hoppy, flowery, a bit creamy. Flavour is hoppy, flowery, citrus.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;Enjoyed on tap at the brewpub. Serviceable pale, served cold. Caesar head on grapefruit colour, and lacey. Decent bitterness, drying finish. Middling at best mouthfeel.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Clear amber with small off-white head. Aroma is very fruity and sweet malt. Flavor is a litle earthy hop, a little floral, sweet caramel malt. Medium and lively carbonation. Tasty with a hop forward flavor
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;<i>Draft at the brewpub:</i> This is a buttery bomb. Pours a yeasty gold with a thin, ivory head. Diacytel lays heavy on top of the otherwise hoppy nose. The citrusy hops are choked out by the buttery notes. More of the same in the body. Sweet caramel enters the mix as a healthy dosing of NW hops adds complexity. Unfortunately the butter makes this thick in the mouth and slick on the tongue, ruining much of the pale ale experience.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;Overall was decent. Taste was crisp, yet light. Palate sat well, finished with a nice hop flavor.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Poured a hazed copper with a white fizzy head. Fruity citrus hops in the nose. Sweet and tropical. Caramel malt flavors with citrus, tropical fruits, and hops. Touch of floral bitterness and spice in the finish. Surprisingly refreshing and tasty.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;Draft sampler at North Peak. Poured an amber color with a moderate fizzy white head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Light sour citrus hop aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Medium bitter flavor with a medium bitter of moderate duration duration. Good drinkable brew.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;Pours a hazy orange color with a thin white head. Aroma of resinous hops. Flavor of resinous and piney hops, interesting but lacks a solid presence of malt to give some sense of balance, it finishes with bitterness. The body is light with an oily texture and lively carbonation. The best beer I had at this brewpub, which doesn’t say much.
North Peak Pale Ale;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;North Peak Brewing Company;12 Oz Bottle. Aroma of dying plant material and crushed seeds. Pour of an almost opalsecent tawny green-gold. Rim of white. Flavor is disgusting, a real disagreeing bite of sourness and dry tannins. There’s not much malt or hop character, just a disconcerting pain of sour and dry fighting. It’s ugly.
Jeringham St. Red Ant;South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jeringham Street Brewery;Stumbled on this back in 2000, probably about the time they closed. (Rating from notes.) Poured an amber colour with ruby tints and a decent head. Rich nose - some toffee, coffee grounds and peppery alcohol. Surprisingly forceful for its abv. Toasted malt characters, caramel and a little sherry. Jesus, this is a queer fish. Unusually complex for a pale lager. Pity they didn’t sort out the bottling because they were on to something. (Bottle)
Jeringham St. Red Ant;South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jeringham Street Brewery;Murky headless brown stuff, less carbonation than tap water, foul taste like a dirty, wet rag. Perhaps this bottle was a dud, but looking at duffs rating, that's a 50/50 chance you've got, which just isn't good enough. Stupid bottle.
Jeringham St. Red Ant;South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jeringham Street Brewery;looks good. the sweetness is not adequately counterbalanced by the vague roasted malts. still, pretty good for something from south australia
Jeringham St. Red Ant;South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Jeringham Street Brewery;Has a dumb screwtop that makes you feel like your about to open a bottle coke or something. I don't think this beer was fresh, if it was they would have a lot of work to do, because it wasn't to pleasant, syrup, not much head, and sticky.
West End 107;Thebarton, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Amber colouring with a decent sized head. Tinnie, bitter, woody, roasted taste. Never again.
West End 107;Thebarton, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Genuine Pilsener my arse. Anyway this smells really disgusting. Vomit, grass, heaps of DMS and metal are all present. It tastes a lot better thankfully, the DMS seems to manifest itself in a dried apricot type flavour, which works pretty well with the unfermented sweetness. Not bitter but has a dirt aftertaste. Hold your nose and it's drinkable.
West End 107;Thebarton, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Something of a hoppy aroma. Flavour is immediately bitter and a little sour in the finish. The sour taste is the only thing which distinguishes this from regular Aussie crap.
West End 107;Thebarton, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A nice tasting beer but not really a pilsener. Not bitter enough. Too similar to draught. The reason why I gave this beer such a low score was that West End has aggresively marketed this beer over the last few months as a pilsener and when I finally tasted it, I was bitterly (or bitterlessly) disappointed. Tates ok but not as a pilsener.
West End 107;Thebarton, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;South Australia Brewing (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Fresh Pils, yay! If only it was terrific instead of the insipid, tempremental mediocrity sold at a premium price $36AUS per 24 x 375mls. Nice but lazy head. Light nose of flowery grass/cowhide, light first flavour is all bitter Saaz then develops to full bitterness, coarse acid finish of wood (jarrah) and final finish of toffee(slightly burnt). Hey that's not too bad. Tip: Don't drink this out of the bottle, use a clean, rinsed lager style glass. Amazed at the difference.

Hoegaarden Verboden Vrucht;Hoegaarden, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Hoegaarden (AB InBev);Style:ベルジャン・エール アンバー〜茶色。透かすと濁っているように見えます。 ●総評 8.5%と高いアルコール度数をまるで感じさせない、さっぱりとした口当たりとのど越しです。 甘さとドライ感の調和が綺麗にとれていて、後味にはあまり残らない一方、深み重みはあるため確かな満足感を与えてくれます。 ●時期 このさっぱり感のため、他の重たいブラウンビールと違い、夏も含めたオールシーズン楽しめそうです。 ●合わせ あっさりしたナッツ類 ビール自体の味がしっかりしているので、料理と一緒にというよりは主役として楽しむ感じでしょうか。 シンプルな素材の味が残る料理なら、豚肉などとも相性は良さそうです。 ●風味 オレンジの風味がこのさっぱり感を生んでいるんでしょう。 コリアンダーには気付けなかったです。 またforbidden fruit の名から想像するほど罪的なインパクトはありません。全体的なまろやかなまとまりはりんごっぽいと言えるかもしれませんが、りんごの味もしません。

Jaeger Pilsener Bier;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij de Oranjeboom (InBev);Rated from memory of hundreds of bottles drank in 1997-2000-something (until the brand disappeared). Golden with white head. Bitter and sweet pils malt. Typical cheap pils taste but price/quality better in balance than some beers in upper or lower price ranges. Cool logo of a hunter with a dog.
Jaeger Pilsener Bier;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij de Oranjeboom (InBev);Used to drink this all the time with my friends in highschool! We would drag crates of bottles to our frieds garage and get shitfaced while watching b-movies, smoking weed and making music. Maybe it was because of all the weed but the beer didn't seem to be that horrible and it always did the job. And damn was it cheap!
Jaeger Pilsener Bier;Breda, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij de Oranjeboom (InBev);Tasted this years and years ago I believe from 50 cl cans. Bought it when I was still in my ’I want to drink as much as I can’ period. Since this was the cheapest can in the supermarket I probably bought at least 20 with some friends and we drank them all. Oh my, am I glad those times are years behind me now. Was it bad? Yes, but undrinkable? No. Cheapest or not, if it really was undrinkable clearly we would have bought something else, but it was a cheap industrial lager and it tasted that way.

Grainy nose, even chaff, post-harvest summer stubblefield. Onset of the taste is allright, even a bit ""herb"". Then it turns into sweet, flat, even corn-like taste. Initial heavy carbonation falls flat suddenly, leaving a dead & boring beer, watery texture. Bof. Dutch supermarket pilsener - says it all."

Ott Edel-Pils;Heiligenstadt-Oberleinleitner, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Gasthof Ott;The beer looks like every other pilsener. The color of the beer is golden yellow. The beer is very clear. Some bubbles can be seen rising towards the top. On top of the beer, a very rough layer of white foam is formed. The bulk of the foam collapses, leaving a minimal drape of foam. The smell is okay. I smell some strong bitter hops. They have a nice ’crispy’ thing going on. It’s that typical German pilsener aroma. There is also a nice and clear malty sweetness. Sweets and bitters are in good balance, both in the smell and the taste. The taste of the beer is also just that of simple, ordinary pilsener. It is a bit more balanced though, stronger in taste a bit more distinguished. You can taste and smell the hops a little better. Nice beer. The beer has a rather strong carboxylation, making it a firm beer, with completely suits the beer type.

Moosehead Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;This is the best Ice beer I have ever had. Can’t find this beer anymore. Oh, well there are more tastier beers.
Moosehead Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;This is a big step down from regular moosehead IMHO. 6% not 56% but the flavor is more towards the adjunct and this is more like an ale with some fruity flavor.
Moosehead Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Thin, watery, bland best describe this beer from Moosedrool. I had this beer in Canada while visiting friends last summer. I wouldn't normally turn down a free beer, but that's exactly what I should have done. It was another skunked moose beer as far as I'm concerned. Poured out a whiteish yellow color, with not much head at all. Smelled of cheap 6-row grain, and corn adjuncts. Something akin to Karo syrup poured on buckwheat pancakes is what it smelled like to me. The aroma was much better than the taste of this bilge water. It didn't have much in the way of body, being thin and weak. Hoppiness was more bitter and unbalanced than anything. I'm sure glas I didn't have to buy this stuff, because I would have demanded my money back, and it would have made me the ugly American.

Havent gotten much of this either, but one time at a party, this older guy wanted to have a chug off with me and I knew I would lose anyway, so I declined his offer of a Cold Natty Ice in favor of a warm Moosehead Ice... I chugged the thing down with dip in my mouth and didnt even cringe from it... now THATS good beer!!!
Moosehead Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;I had some with funk and I have to say I'd sooner drink icehouse. Enough said.

Moosehead Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;This was very very bad. Maybe the fact that there was a lot of dust on the bottles should have tipped me off, but no. Anyway me and a friend had two of these and then made funk drink the other four. The boy was not pleased.

Hamms Special Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is the beer I keep in the fridge just to grab and drink regularly.

What more can you ask for?
Hamms Special Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);For a light pale lager it’s good. No foul funky grossness. Easy going down. What the he double hockey sticks else you want in cheap beer? Happy New Year!
Hamms Special Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"old review - a little less offensive than regular Hamms, so a little more palatable.

Wild Onion Winter Warmer;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Wild Onion Brewery;On tap. Poured a clear amber with a nice off-white head and decent lacing. Aroma was caramel, nutty, and bready. Taste was about the same as the aroma with some cloves and spice.
Wild Onion Winter Warmer;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Wild Onion Brewery;This one was sampled last night at the brewpub. Their literature stated it was 7.5% ABV. I agree with earlier assessements that the beer arrived almost black with just some lacing. An initial smell and taste led with the alcohol, quickly followed by the dried fig and raisin malt taste. A little bit of roast coffee also. Hops just pricked a little bit at the end of the taste with a slight herbal character. It went down as advertised very smooth even with an alcohol lead.
Wild Onion Winter Warmer;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Wild Onion Brewery;Mahogany/brown with a few bubbles forming a watery head. Bizarre aroma of dry tea is overwhelming with an added boost of instant coffee as well. A smooth, bitter flavor mimmicks the aroma with coffee and tea with mild fruitiness and alcohol creeping in at the finish. A bit earthen with minor sweetness late. On cask at Night of the Living Ales III, Goose Island Wrigleyville 03/03/07
Wild Onion Winter Warmer;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Wild Onion Brewery;This poured kind of a murky amber and didn’t hold much of a head. It has a light aroma of raisins, maybe prunes, alcohol, and old malt. It delivers more in the flavor beginning with the alcohol followed by dried fruits, molasses, apples, and brown sugar.

Wild Onion Winter Warmer;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Wild Onion Brewery;muddy red appearance with mustard color. lots of flavor, but lots of alcohol too. reminded me somewhat of the old jubilation flavor. hard rock candy flavor, pears/apples. some raisins. altogether unimpressive.
Wild Onion Winter Warmer;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Wild Onion Brewery;Sample at the brewpub.

Some interesting stuff here but doesn’t quite come together.

Potts Pilsener;Oelde, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Potts Naturpark Brauerei;Pours a bright golden color with a decent sized, stable white head, which coats the glass the whole time. Smells of wheat, rock sugar and a coppery softness, with just a hint of yeast sourness to it. Drinks soft, very smooth with a lively carbonation, leading to a refreshing dry finish. Tastes of white bread malts, wheat and prominent hoppiness, perfectly entangled into the bready malt foundation. The hops take almost completely over after the swallow, putting the malts into a supportive role, finishing very herbal, still soft and balanced, but with an awesomly clean crispness. Fantastic Pilsener, easy drinking, refreshing with a very subtle, carefully integrated malt foundation which is entertaining by itself, while it leaves lots of space on the palate for the pungent, noble hops to unfold.

Potts Alt Potts Landbier;Oelde, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Potts Naturpark Brauerei;Pours a deep amber/mahogany coloration with a large, frothy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt and hints of grains and hay. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by slightly sweet, bready, caramel malt, but balanced very nicely by earthy, grassy and slightly herbal hops, with subtle notes of grains and citrus and a light mineral character as well. Finishes with a very light bitterness and some sweet malts lingering in the aftertaste. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. This is quite a nice Landbier with an exceptional malt/hop balance that gives it a certain complexity, but without sacrificing drinkability at all. Goes down very smooth, great stuff.

t Smisje Wostyntje;Mater, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Smisje;Bottle. Pours hazy amber. Good white head. Smell is weird. Spices, yes, but its hard to recognize mustard to be honoust. A sweet aspect, a plastic one as well... Taste is bitter, some sharp spices taste. Overpowering carbonation ruins everything once again.... The mustard aint clear, but it does have a specific touch to it. Its kinda OK , but so damn overcarbonated....
t Smisje Wostyntje;Mater, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Smisje;It pours first a hazy orange brown then turns cloudy. Great head of foam, retention, and lacing. Spicy nose to start..smells like some asian spices were used and the mustard spice clearly listed in the name. Quite a bit of sugary sweetness seeps through and there’s an earthy character here as well. Mmm..spicy, candi sugar sweets, earthy malt, cool that the mustard seeds integrate so well giving the beer an unusual but enjoyable balance. Medium body with the carbo on the lighter side. I only bought 1 bottle but I’ll buy more if it’s still around. An overall tasty son of a gun.
t Smisje Wostyntje;Mater, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Smisje;03/12/2014 @home - 33cl bottle from brewery. Masive gusher!! What a pitty because after that, I really liked the beer. Amber coloured, foamy head, Smell has soms lambic like sourness, light sweetness, floral. Taste : light sourness, spices & hops, at the back some sweetness. What a pity of the gusher because its taste is verry nice and complex 01/02/2015 : re-taste, no gushing this time and the beer is much better than the 3.9 I gave earlier, damn it’s really good!
t Smisje Wostyntje;Mater, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Smisje;bottle. thick murky pour with sediment and no head. aroma of caramel. sharp carbonation and thick syrupy body. flavor of caramel. lingering unpleasant bitterness in the finish and maybe the slightest hint of heat from the mustard seed. not much life left. pretty bad.
t Smisje Wostyntje;Mater, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Smisje;Tasted when it was still made at the original Regenboog brewery, not sure if it has changed a lot since Johan Brandt moved his brewing activities, but it is hard to imagine it hasn’t. In its original form, this was a pleasant, amber coloured musterd seed beer, in which a very slight hint of mustard was indeed detectable, yet covered by a candi sugar and malty sweetness. Had some complexity and was quite enjoyable.

t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;This is a good Belgian, but not quite top notch. Cloudy brown/amber appearance. Lots of carbonation here...champagne-like mouthfeel. Almost overly sweet flavor...tasty though. Sweet and sour fruit, malty, wheaty, with good hop finish. The honey and raisons stand out nicely. A lot like DFH Raison D' Etra (but twice the price). Worth the try, but there are better in this style.
t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;’Massive ale’ celebrating the renowned Flemish poet Guido Gezelle, customarily presented in stone cups citing his poetry. Yellowish white foam, deep reddish brown colour. Sweet fruity smell of raisins, plums, pear, cinnamon, honey (effectively used), caramelly taste with sweet raisins, faintly sugary, malty, spicy and yeasty with sourish hint almost reminiscent of an oud bruin, light bitter finish.
t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;A magnificent piece of Belgian brewing art. Strong blond beer with honey, raisin and lots of spices. Very sweet, but with a complex and malty body. Very good.
t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;"33cl bottle, expire date end 2012, carefully preserved in my cellar but I do not remember the provenience of the bottle. Having faced serious yeast problems in previous ’t Smisje beers I figured it was time to check out Guido too, this idea gifting me a nice afternoon. This particular brew, which belongs to the ""classic"" ’t Smisje line - I do not know if they are still producing it, the informations are confusing - is dedicated to Flemish XIX century poet Guido Gezelle. I never read anything by him but I guess Brandt enjoyed his poems quite a lot, if he dedicated him a beer such as ""Guido"" is. This pours brown, opalescent, with small, crisp but subtle head; the foam is not long-lasting but leaves a lace around the glass and would be easy to re-form were I not drinking this one in my Orval glass (not easy to rotate without spilling). The nose is complex and strong, smell of confiture, fruits preserved in alcohol, nuts and sweet caramel; mouth opens and remains quite sweet for a while but is twisted with gentle roasted tones to a bittersweet and slightly drier finish, encouraging another sip. This is the perfect autumn beer, and I fear I predated the perfect timing of a month or so - the hot sun outside makes an awkward pairing - but anyway somptueux à siroter and in a way so simple, so familiar, so Belgian, it touches one’s heart."
t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Bottle. Pours a very hazy brown color with a moderate, but quickly disappearing head. Nose is quite fruity and slightly sweet. Taste is also quite sweet with some fruity elements to it. Not a huge fan of this.
t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Bottle from Artisan Wine Depot. $5.89 A good Belgium Beer but not that complex. It is tasty. Aroma old raisins, winter spice, hint of banana. Not as sweet as some of the reviews mention. The biggest thing that stands out is the strong acidic raisins. A hint of maple and stinging carbonation. Dirty finish.
t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;33 cl bottle at brewery smiske in Mater. Dark brown with red shine body and large off white head. Very sweet caramel and raisin taste. Too sweet for me. **
t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;Rich aroma with bread, fruit, caramel, and spice. Flavor is sweet with coffee cake and fruit. A little alcohol in the finish for balance. A little too sweet, but I still liked this a lot better than the rating suggests.
t Smisje Guido;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij De Regenboog;2013.01.27 - Regenboog (t Smisje) Guido - 11.2oz bottle in goblet glass. This must be an older bottle as it's clearly marked Regenboog and not t Smisje. Pours a raisin color caramel, slightly red. Little to no head, about a half cap that settles to a lightly foamy ring. Aroma is sweet honey and a bit of bready yeast. Mouthfeel is pretty light and slick. Medium carbonation. Taste is OK. Not as sweet as you'd expect with honey and raisins but it's there. I'm also guessing this bottle is well past its prime, no date indications to tell for sure. There is sweetness on the front end. At the very back end it almost resolves to a bit of a smoky flavor and just a trace of alcohol warmth. Not bad, I may seek out fresher vintages. Aroma 5/10, Appearance 3/5, Taste 6/10, Palate 3/5, Overall 14/20

t Smisje Tripel;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij De Regenboog;This was Smisje’s take on the tripel style, a strong orange blonde bear with thick, dense head and a malty and estery profile, some fruitiness, yeasty, spicy hints, with dryish finish more so from badly hidden alcohol than from elegant hop bitterness. Unbalanced, one of the lesser Smisje beers and one of the lesser tripels, in my opinion.

Lys, skittenbrun farge, kanskje den burde ha stått lenger i ro. Aroma av appelsin, litt koriander og overmoden frukt (gjær?). Ok karbobering, åpninga til tross, middels munnfylde til en tripel å være. Smaken heller mot det bitre, og ettersmaken er mer bitter enn søt. En annerledes tripel, den bøir ingen favoritt hos meg.

Red brown with nice head. Nose and taste is dark malts, bit chocolate, hint of fruits. Damn still nice after all these years.
t Smisje Dubbel;Assebroek-Brugge, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij De Regenboog;The aroma is caramelized and dried fruits on the sidelines. Almost on a Christmas ale-like fashion smells of prune, plum, dates and raisins. The taste follow up its aromas and all the fruits can be tasted in the beer. It has 9% alcohol, but leaves only a residual heat in the mouth. The taste is hardly affected by the high alcohol content. It is an extremely tasty and well-brewed dubbel, and you should definitely buy if you get the chance.

This later, but now also discontinued version had a light beige, loose, thinning but stable head and deep bronze colour with chocolate brownish hue, cloudy with deposit. Aroma of caramel, candied dates, plums, pear, grassy hops, ginger, cinnamon, liquorice and some DMS (red cabbage). Malty taste with refreshing fruity touches, dryer in the middle with some spiciness and a long, peppery hoppy finish as well as warming, even somewhat astringent alcohol.

Taste is pear, earthy hops and light malt. Palate is medium-to-full bodied with creamy, slick texture, average carbonation and sweet finish. Overall, strange for a baltic porter--tasted most similar to Samuel Smith’s Organic Pale Ale (a bitter) than anything else. Didn’t wow me for a style I usually love.

Light roasted floral chocolate front. Creamy textured sweet dry body has roasted rich flavors. Cloying end with crusty texture and mild hop spice citrus. Sampled 6/13/2001.
Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;"A yeasty and dark roasted aroma greets the nose immediately, and the flavor of the beer follows through accordingly; The dry, dark roasted flavor is moderately bitter and strong; A rather prominent and unpleasant yeasty flavor and a slight spiciness are on display throughout, and detract considerably; Hops seems pretty subdued; Opaque and almost black in color; Dark tan, creamy head has good size on the pour and exhibits solid retention and lacing"
Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;Dark brown with a light brown/burgundy head. Rich, spicey aroma of scotch, wood and grapes. Extremely too carbonated on the mouth, makes it feel like you're drinking cola. Tastes like cold, carbonated coffee
Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;Motor oil black with a solid amount of spit on tha top. Has an aroma of chocolate and mushrooms. Really smooth, with some choco and roasted walnut notes and some grease fried mushrooms. Not bad.
Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;Weird woody note throughout on this one. Pretty chocalatey, but that damn wood ruins it. Not good. Orchard Street is dreadful, outside it's pale ale.
Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;Poured and looked great! Black-brown, totally opaque with a medium light brown head. The aroma and appearance were my favorite parts of this brew. Smelled of rich roasted malts, chocolate and coffee with a definite piney hop note. Initial flavor is also roasted malt, slightly sweet, then yielding to an assertive hoppiness. Lots of citrus in the hops, in fact a bit much for my taste as the finish occurred to me as a lingering sour and astringent dryness.
Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;Bottle. Black color with a brown laced head. A nice dark chocolate aroma with a bit of roast. Sweet roasted flavors with a malty aftertaste.
Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;Translucent dark brown. Beige head.

Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;Totally an english style porter..its just has that strange english balance of malt and hops. The aroma is pretty non-existant...some burnt roasts and malt, and a clean bathroom smell (weird huh?). It pours a very headless black color with just minute pockets of brown in the light. The taste is brimming with roasted malts, molasses, and coffee. Some smokey aspects, and a nice dry english malty finish with some bittering and hops prevalent near the ending..more so than i am even used to. Good mouthfeel, little in the way of carbonation, fairly smooth drinking. A nice pickup.
Orchard Street Porter;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Porter;Orchard Street Brewery;Dark, not that much of an aroma. Burnt flavor dominates the tastes, there must be alot of roasted malt in this one. This is a really nice porter. Thanks Beerguy101!

Grimbergen Roussa;Jumet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Union - Alken-Maes (Heineken);75 cl Bottle - Expired august 2003 Despite being 12,5 years past its prime, I very much liked the taste of this beer. With aromas of citrus, orange and some caramel it tasted a lot like lemonade. But in a good way. Carbonation was flat, no foam left on this beer, but that’s very easy to understand after all these years. It tasted very good, no remarks. Overall a very drinkable beer, if you ever come across an old bottle (as it’s no longer produced) don’t hesitate and try..
Grimbergen Roussa;Jumet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Union - Alken-Maes (Heineken);Vintage bottle, best before 2003. Whales ! Pours unclear amber, not much head. Smell is Dusty and oxidized. Taste is mildly sweet , Sharp oxidation. Some maderization. Not too bad to be honest. Bit thin , Woody aftertaste due to the age
Grimbergen Roussa;Jumet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Union - Alken-Maes (Heineken);Tasted about twelve years ago when this was quite popular for a while. An amber coloured rendition of the Grimbergen brand, with loose, off-white head and sweetish character of caramelly and slightly nutty malts, apple and some spiciness, mild bitterish finish, but artificial and a bit bland like the other Grimbergen beers.

Grimbergen Roussa;Jumet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Union - Alken-Maes (Heineken);Bottle at restaurant in Brussels. Hazy orange with a beige head.

Grimbergen Roussa;Jumet, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Union - Alken-Maes (Heineken);Dark reddish color and a really nice aroma. I think all Grimbergens have a nice aroma. This is not nearly as good as the double or triple. But a drinkable beer. Malty flavor, maybe hints of caramel. Drinkable, but there are better beers in this category for sure.

Petrus Aged Pale;Harelbeke, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;De Brabandere;Geel bier met weinig schuim. Het bier is mooi zuur, zo zuur dat de kaken er van samen trekken. In de aroma veel fruit en iets van gist. Heeft door de droge afdronk iets van champagne. (Mitra Xperience 2019)
Petrus Aged Pale;Harelbeke, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;De Brabandere;BToo on 14th. The only place close to what we had in Den Haag but not nearly half as good. 2 beers, pickles, and muscles all went well with the beer. The 109 dollar check did not. Beer leans on the cherry side.

Petrus Aged Pale;Harelbeke, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;De Brabandere;Whew. You drink one of these and you can really tell the difference between classic Belgian sours and the new school. Let's start with the nose. Rich and complex with striking strawberry, lactic acid, must and peppery hops. Starts intensely sour, which trails of quickly, and is replaced with an unexpected herbal bitterness that tails out to a garden vegetable, fruit plant and sour cherry fade. There's a lot going on here. Extremely complex and challenging beer that separates the old guard from short shorts wearing, unkempt beard growing, hazy IPA worshipping metrosexuals. Keeping it real, Petrus serves up a beer snob's dream. You want conversation, forget the white elephants, dig this!
Petrus Aged Pale;Harelbeke, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;De Brabandere;Tja, als zuur overheerst en de finesse en de fraicheur vergeten wordt. Een Geuze? Nope niet in de buurt

Dragonmead Earl Spit Stout;Warren, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Dragonmead Brewery;From notes. Finally getting around to adding beers from the Ypsi Summer Beerfest! Enjoyed on July 25. The pour on this is pretty light for what I was expecting on a stout. There is a light beige head that falls down rapidly, leaving just a light ring and no real lace. The aroma is pretty basic. Kind of malty and there is a good roast. It’s also a little hoppy which is a touch surprising. The flavor isn’t much different. It’s got some good characters, but it’s light. The mouth feel is excessively light with a decent carbonation but it’s incredibly thin. There is a little sweetness on the back end, but it’s a pretty basic light stout. Forgettable.

Denisons Smoked Marzen;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Smoked - Rauchbier;Denisons Brewing Co. (Victoria St.);"Bright reddish-copper. I wish they would use a more robust glass to serve this in than the modified weizen glass they prefer, but otherwise it looks great. Caramalty, toasted aroma; a fair deal of smokiness up front, fading into a firm, long finish that is malty but dry, and crackerlike. Not the most robust example, but well-structured and with enough smoke to get by."

Nighthawk Malt Liquor;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);A 40 from the beautiful state of Louisiana. Piss yellow pour, almost nothing of fizz white head. It does have a strange sweet grape drink flavor, with bad grains, and a light touch of hops.
Nighthawk Malt Liquor;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Somewhat appley nose, corny and sweet but not overpoweringly so.

Nighthawk Malt Liquor;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);24oz banged up can shared by riversideak. I really love malt liqour labels, I’d like to meet some of the graphic artists. Pours clear and gold with a white head that fall quick. Fruity artificial smelling with light corny adjunct and some hay. Light and kind of ’clean’ tasting as far as a malt liqour goes. Tangy apple finish and touches of corn through out.
Nighthawk Malt Liquor;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Nighthawk Malt Liquor has a thick, white, creamy head, with a very clear straw appearance. Carbonation is high. The aroma is of citrus (lime, I’d say), with a chemical back smell (think roofing tar). Taste is also very much of lime, with a flat hop bitterness, that comes across cheap. Mouth-feel is light and watery, and Nighthawk finishes crisp and surprisingly refreshing. This drink is very similar to Mickey’s Fine Malt Liquor, which may be the intention. Overall, this is a very light-bodied beer, and better than I expected. I was happy that my sample (poured from a clear glass 40 oz. bottle) was not skunked. RJT

Nighthawk Malt Liquor;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Cold tall boy can. Purchased with the intention of finding the most horrifyingly awful brew to celebrate RCL’s 1200th rating...and it was a failure. This really is not bad. Aroma of niagra grapes, citrus, and sweet corn. Flavor is sweet, with more corn and caramel. The higher level of carbonation and touch of hops cut through the sweetness, leaving my palate refreshed. A very enjoyable malt liquor, especially when one considers the $1.09 price tag.

Touches of grass and toast, minimized alcohol. Full body but watery with chunkier drifts; heavy caramel and earth but minor citrus, smooth and balanced and traditional, a lot of hop flavor without a lot of standout brightness or any of the trendy newer tones.

Absence notable de col. Au nez, café, chocolat. Goût, très maltée, café, chocolat, vamille. Belle rondeur. Au palais, une discrète amertume qui lui confère un équilibre apprécié.

Bell's Java Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Pretty much the standard when it comes to coffee stouts. Dry, chocolatey, and full of black coffee notes, backed up by a modest vinous java acidity and a long, bitter, roasty finish. Notes of anise, char, and toasted nuts, while the back end steadfastly refuses to grow sweet. Pours a deep, dark black with a modest beige head and slight lacing. Mocha nose isn't as rich or deep as you'd expect, but the taste makes it all okay. Moderate carbonation gives the perfect texture. Classic beer.

It’s so full of coffee and roasted malts and it’s got coffee bitterness with malt sweetness and this mouthfeel that eases the senses. Wow what a beer.

Arbor Steamroller Imperial Stout;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;pitch black, mild head. a ton of hop flavor that overpowers the mild crystal, cholocolate and very little roasty flavor. not a good version
Arbor Steamroller Imperial Stout;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Pours a pitch black color with tiny brown highlights and a ring of light brown lace. Interesting aroma of chocolate, and a rich roasted malt. The flavor has the same chocolate and rich, roasted malt but the alcohol is very present too, which I like less. The palate is light and liquorous and the carbonation is gentle. A good imperial stout but it’s too alcoholic for my tastes.
Arbor Steamroller Imperial Stout;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;"10 oz draught at the brewpub in early August 2006. A light caramel-creme head dies slowly above the opaque body leaving a trace of lacing....deep chocolate nose, bittersweet, offers hints of black currant and prunes, and as it grows with warmth, graham cracker.....rich, decadent, chocolate-coffee body, very smooth with undercurrants of coffee-cake toffee and a faintly burnt character towards the finish joined by espresso and some smoke....alcohol barely apparent....surprised at the lower ratings for this, it worked extremely well for me--better balanced in terms of burnt/roasty vs sweet tones than most; or maybe it’s just the joy of finding a new Imperial in midsummer. Anyway, excellent."
Arbor Steamroller Imperial Stout;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;MBG 06. Dark black, frothy brown head. Decent aroma - alcohol and chocolate, but its pretty mild for the style. Taste - roast, chocolate, lots of hops. Simple, as not near as kicked up a few notches as it should be. Ok.
Arbor Steamroller Imperial Stout;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Draught sample at MBG 2006 Summer Festival. Thick black pour with a small mocha head. Really odd aroma - strangely earthy/vegetal notes, like something I’d small at the farm, along with the expected dark roast malt. Body is big and slightly syrupy. Flavour is sweet and malty, with nut and chocolate - a bit mellower than I expected to be honest, but that’s OK, I quite enjoyed it.
Arbor Phat Abbot Belgian Tripel;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Bottle from Baldwin beer store.

Cloudy dark amber color, off-white head that quickly drops to a thin rim, a few globs of lace. Taste is over-sweet malt that moves through light fizz to a bracing (for this brew) tart and hoppy finish. Seems a little off - on the one hand, too much sweet, on the other very little going on, which makes it seem past its ""best by"" date. Not a keeper in this form."
Arbor Phat Abbot Belgian Tripel;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;Mild sweet candy aroma. Pale, from a bot. Big strong abbey and alky initial taste impact. Whew.

Arbor Phat Abbot Belgian Tripel;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;I’m a big fan of belgian style ales. This has a good aroma to start. The color has a nice darker hazy look with a good amount of vizable carbonation. The taste is malty with a good amount of spice and a bit of sweetess that makes this a good beer to sip. The finish is slightly tart but it makes this beer very drinkable since you keep going back for more. I love to drink this with a hearty beef stew. Caramel, nuts, toast, roasty, woody, raisin

Moosehead Dry Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Ocena spisana z notatek. Kolor złoty, biała piana dość szybko znikaa. Mocne nagazowanie, lekko kwaskowe, słodowe i słodkawe, przyjemne w piciu ale mało wyraziste. Dzięki Lagerman.
Moosehead Dry Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;En lidt anonym øl. Den har smagen af humle og malt sødmen. Der kunne godt være mere af det hele.
Moosehead Dry Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Wässrig und unspektakulär. Leichte Süße Noten von Malz und spürbare Getreidenoten aber sonst ist da nichts. Kurz, schmerzlos, nicht besonders. Tut keinem weh, überzeugt aber auch nicht.
Moosehead Dry Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Purchased a 12-pack at the NSLC on my trip to Nova Scotia. Pours a clean golden colour with a frothy white head, decent retention and nice lacing. Smooth malt nose with hints of goat milk soap and sweetness. Malty tasting as well with some decent grain in the finish. The mouthfeel is where this is not very pleasant and the lingering aftertaste. Alcohol is well-hidden and malt does not feel too fake overall.
Moosehead Dry Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Another after hockey beer. Reviewed from notes, a couple stolen out of the locker room to take back for observation purposes. Here are my notes from cans and bottles. This was poured into pilseners and pint glasses and honestly, there really isn’t any difference. The appearance was a fairly decent looking clear yellow color with a vast amount of carbonation to be seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a rapidly dissipating one finger white foamy head. There wasn’t any lacing. The smell had some cooked corn - kinda like adjuncts. The taste was mainly sweet through the cooked corn. There was a dry sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat exceptionally light and sessionable. The carbonation lends a decent harshness, but nothing to scrape your tongue. Overall, serviceable light lager, nothing too bad, but nothing mind blowing.
Moosehead Dry Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Ins Glas ergießt sich ein goldgelbes Bier mit geringer Schaumkrone. Geruch leicht malzig, getreidig, leicht süß. Geschmack wässrig, leicht malzig getreidig, minimal herb.
Moosehead Dry Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;355ml can. This used to be my go-to beer back like 12 years ago, but they stopped selling it in NB and I moved on to imports and crafts. Picked up a case in Nova Scotia where it is still sold. Clear, flat yellow colour, head lasted about 3 seconds. Aroma is sweet and grainy. Taste is reasonably full for a pale lager, goes sweet and grains rather than adjuncts and corn like so many cheap lagers. I still like that better than crap like Bud or Coors or even other Moose products. Might just be extra points for nostalgia, or a 6% beer for a 4% price.
Moosehead Dry Ice;St. John, New Brunswick, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moosehead Breweries;Bottle shared by Dutchdrebus. Clear yellow to golden color, small white head. Smell and taste lightly malts, slightly mint, slightly sweet-bitter and a bit weird.

Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle from The Beer a Cellar April 2013. Truly a horrid beer that tastes like I’m not sure what.
Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);In a perfect world I would get my due recognition as the sole arbiter of good taste and I could not only prevent the public from trying this beer, but I could get the brewers prosecuted for crimes against humanity. It looks innocuous enough, but beneath the veneer of insipid ’pale lager that perfectly compliments any darker fish meal’ is a dangerous, sweet timebomb that exists merely as a vehicle for malodourous malcontents to get blasted out of their tiny minds. I damn this beer and anyone who enjoys it and would willingly sentence them to penal servitude until they knew better.
Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I’ll leave this rubbish to the teenies to swallow. Yuk Not worth a rating.
Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Sampled on Flashy’s tour of LA, New Zealand and Hong Kong of September/October 2007 - Not much good this. Smooth, but had very little taste. A bit like one of those ghastly ""Ice"" lagers."
Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Drank from a bottle. Slightly stronger beer. Cheap as-$20 for 18 beers. Colour is quite yellow. Very affordable. I last had one at a wedding 2 months ago.
Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle bought some where on the road in North Island.

Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Drank from a tumbler. Slightly darker than straw, with a little malt and sweetness in the aroma and flavour. Barely any head and in fact this beer is generally just too thin. More affordable than many of my other rated beers so I lately, since having quit drinking Leopard Lager and unless rating something ""special"", stick with this one. Nothing great but, certainly not nauseating. Competes commercially with DB Breweries Flame."
Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Sweet nose. really thin, but i suppose theres a bit of flavour in there. A bit sweet and sticky, i wasn't really expecting much with the word ""ice"" in its name. A bit of a preservative taste in there aswell, not a fan."
Lion Black Ice;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);not really black but straw colour. Sweet with malty nose. Aimed at young drinkers
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at Shakespeare Tavern, Auckland. Pours pale golden with small white head. Grainy aroma and flavour with grassy notes. Thin bodied with low bitterness. Forgettable beer.
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at brew pub. Pale golden beer with a strong head. The aroma is pilsner like with hints of brussel sprouts. The flavour is yeasty with a bitter finish. Overall an average yeasty and dry beer.
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at the brew pub, a carbonated pale gold with a thin white head. No notable aroma. A sweet malty palate. Dry, with a grainy aftertaste. More mediocrity from Shakespeare.
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;(On tap) Clear golden with a small, lacing, white head. Fresh and slightly flowery aroma. Light in body with good malt accents and a fresh, flowery whiff of hops. The finish is dry with some bitterness. A very drinkable Lager. 080208
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Nice lager. Very yellow colour with thin head lemon aroma, some citrus and low bitterness. As some others noted, good for such low ABV.
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Clear pale yellow, brief head. Vague dusty hop aroma. Medium sweet with soft, gentle mouthfeel. Light body and low bitterness. Less character than in their Bohemian lager, but drinks well.
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Almost colourless, pale straw coloured. Some light grassy hops, OK bitterness for the style. Hay and grainy malt flavours. This is obviously what they brew to pay the bills, but it’s pretty good for what it is.
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Pale gold colour, no head. Aroma not present or very weak. Big bitter hoppy taste. Tradional English style lager.
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Low initial aroma but there is a great bitterness in the taste and mouthfeel. At the low ABV this is a good beer.
Shakespeare Barraclough Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Spicy Saaz aroma. Golden-yellow colour with a mo0derate white head. A nice bitterness is present throughout this beer's failry dry, spicy, hop flavour. I like it.
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at Shakespeare Tavern, Auckland. Pours clear golden with small white head. Sweet malt and floral notes. This one is quite well balanced however it’s lacking body and the bitterness for a Pils.
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught as part of the tasting tray at the SOBA monthly meeting, a clear gold in the glass with a head that had long since disappeared. A strong floral aroma with some sweetness. A surprisingly full mouthfeel, with a yeasty and malty flavour and a drying finish. One of their better brewed beers,
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;(On tap) Clear, deep golden with a creamy, off-white head leaving curtains of laces. Lightly floral aroma. Medium body with a solid if sweetish malt base and then a fairly bitter hoppy finish. The hops really build up on your palate. 080208
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;This is a great Lager, great bitterness with some spicy notes and full body. Nice long finish on this one, good balance on this Lager.
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Clear pale yellow, small head. Citric hop aroma. Sweet and malty with fairly soft mouthfeel. Medium bitterness. An aromatic, well balanced lager.
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Slightly darker than their Barraclough lager, but still a pale straw colour. Pronounce noble hop aroma, clean, well-lagered brew. Some light grass/spicy aroma. Flavour is well-balanced, it could use a few more hops, but it is still quite good.
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Clear golden straw colour, no head, oily taste. mild hoppy aroma. rerate due
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Tasted 30/06/2005. Handle at the Shakespeare brewery bar. White head disappears almost immediately. Just a hint of fruity hops on the nose - more goldings than saaz to me, but i could be wrong. Orange gold in the glass with a soft carbonation. Lacey. Flavour is not quite fresh but still tastes ok - sweet juicy malt and a nice, oily, fruity, spicey hop presence. Rounded mouthfeel. My pick of the Shakespeare bunch, so far. Would certainly like to try it fresher.
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;This starts with a slight fruity note of saaz and a typical pils pale colour. Taste it and then woooah. An excellent attempt at a Bohemian pils. Full body and a great mouthfeel. The lace in the glass persists. A very good beer
Shakespeare Summers Day Bohemian Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;This is ramarkably similar to their Barracloughh lager in its nice spicy hop flavour. Perhaps a bit heavier on the palate, a bit more orange than yellow, and not quite as clear as the Barraclough Lager.
Shakespeare Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Stopped in (10/11) because the place smelled fantastic - their PA had just gone off the boil & was being transferred. Only choice was the draught: weak, almost non-existent aroma (cardboard, malt), poor balance (reminded me of an arrested-fermentation LA beer in that it was overly-sweet), bland palate and overall a beer to avoid. Any of the big brewer dark lagers are a better choice, sorry to say.
Shakespeare Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at the brew pub, a light brown colour with no head. A unpleasant musty malt aroma. The palate is sweet, chemical and tart. Quite terrible.
Shakespeare Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;(On tap) Clear, amber golden with a small, white head leaving some lacework. Dry, lightly hoppy aqroma. Light in body, a little watery with a discreet malty feel and a surprisingly bitter finish. An unusual and dry NZ Draught but a very quenching one. 080208
Shakespeare Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Bit of a disappointment compared to the good company this beer keeps. poor heard, sweet malts and very mild bitterness. Good attempt at a bland megalager.
Shakespeare Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Pale amber, brief head. Perfumy hop aroma. Fairly sweet with gentle, rounded mouthfeel and notes of butter and apricot. Light bodied, low bitterness.
Shakespeare Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Pale golden beer. White lace. Nice sweet honeyish aroma, a touch of apple/pear esters. Flavour is clean, light bitterness. Flavour is very appley, but still dry. Easy to put back.
Shakespeare Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Darker than the Baraclough lager. no head. Another beer lacking aroma. Smokey undescribable chemical taste. Would agree that this is the worst beer at Shakespeare.
Shakespeare Draught;Auckland, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;I don't know what a typical NZ lager is supposed to taste like. But this has no nose, flat taste and is poorly balanced.
Shakespeare Shylocks Light;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;An interesting light beer as it has the body of such a style but the aroma and flavour is a pleasant surprise. It has a prominent hallertau or tettnang hop aroma that is carried off well. As stated, a bit thin but by no means a bad light beer.
Shakespeare Macbeths Red Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale - Irish;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught. This was an easy drinking beer that was kind of middling in my opinion.
Shakespeare Macbeths Red Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale - Irish;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Amazing smokiness aroma on this beer, however, such a great initial impression leads to disappointment. There is some sour/zestiness to the flavour on this which starts citrus sour and finishes lactic sour. Body is too thin to match the aroma.
Shakespeare Macbeths Red Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale - Irish;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;On tap with beerledgend. Pours a clear red/brown with a tanned diminishing head. Smells coffeish and slightly sour/hoppy. Tastes sweet with some sourness. Strong flavors of coffee. Otherwise watery and light bodied. Sour coffee-finish. Needs some more malt to back the nothingness up...
Shakespeare Macbeths Red Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale - Irish;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Dark nut brown. Peaty malt aroma. Sweet and light bodied with gentle maltiness. Peaty smoke dominates. The low hop rate leaves plenty of space for the beautiful malt character to excel. The downside of this is that it gets a little bit one dimensional.
Shakespeare Macbeths Red Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale - Irish;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Deep ruby red-brown beer. Sweet malty aroma, caramel, toffee, light licorice, and a distinct peaty character behind everything else. Flvour has peat exploding in the mouth scattering caramel, toffee, and some dark plummy fruits all over. I can’t believe there is so much flavour in a 4% beer. A great find.
Shakespeare Macbeths Red Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale - Irish;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Handle poured from Shakespeare Tavern. A dark colour with a thin head. A burnt caramal aroma which comes through in the tasting. Some unique flavours here that I couldn’t place.
Shakespeare Macbeths Red Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale - Irish;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Low initial aroma but good amber presence and head retention. It becomes a bit thin and lacking in body. The hop presence is understated.
Shakespeare Macbeths Red Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale - Irish;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;"Although they call this one a Scottish Ale, and it does have some of the Scottish charecteristics, it more closely resembles an Irish red ale. Roasted chocolate aroma. Amber-red colour. A well-rounded peaty malt flavour. Fairly buttery. A good beer; not terribly complex, but well-rounded."

Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at Shakespeare Tavern, Auckland. Pours amber with a medium head. Caramel malt and earthy hops. Medium bodied and mild bitterness. One of the better beers from the brewpub.
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;(On tap) Clear, beautiful, warm deep amber with an off-white head. Good nutty aroma. Medium body with a solid base of caramel and nutty accents. Dry, lightly hoppy finish. Unfortunately there’s also some lightly fusty and unclean notes in there. 080208
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Thin aroma with some straw. Great red colour and bitterness. I was concerned that the body would be too light to match the initial aroma and bitterness but this blanaces out tremendously.
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Nut brown, lasting head. Hoppy aroma of tropical fruits. Sweet and fruity soft, and firm yet gently malty. Flowery hop aromatic finish.
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Copper coloured beer with a thin off-white head. Thin malt in the nose with a lot of Fuggles/Golding hop aroma. Earthy and spicy hops mixed with some nice malty notes. Moderately bitter with a well-balanced finish.
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Tasted 23/03/2005. Handle at the brewpub in Auckland. Red kiwi bitter with a woody spiced fuggles flavour. A bit lightweight in the mouth and too cold, otherwise it’s along the lines of Bookbinder as a clean, quaffable, kiwi bitter.
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Poured from the tap at Shakespeare Bar itself. A good attempt at an English Ale this one. Amber-brown colour. Not a strong aroma, but the Fuggles hops come through strongly. Very nice.
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Toffee aroma but no real hop presence. The dry hopping is evident from English hops (fuggles/goldings). With some hand warnth it presents like a fine English ale.
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Amber-orange colour, which is not quite as dark as their MacBeth's Red Ale. Caramel malt aroma with a slight spicy hop nose from dry hopping. The flavour is fairly malty and mild to start with some late hop bitterness and flavour leading up to a lingering bitter finish.
Shakespeare Falstaffs Real Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Very spicy to the nose. Good gold colour with nice clean head..............
Shakespeare Bottoms Up;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Dark amber orange colour witha creamy white head. Spicy hop aroma with hints of whiskey. Failry malty flavour at first with a definite oaky, whiskey-like character developing towards the middle, followed bya nice clean finish. Interesting beer. Very nice!!
Shakespeare Bottoms Up;Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;dark brown red in colour with no head, very sharp taste.....................
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught. This is not like any other old ale I have tasted. It’s just kind of blah.
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Tap. Exceptional! Full marks. Aromas of liquorice, roasted malt, and chocolate. Flavour has a sweet start, and a long-lasting bitter finish. Full-bodied and syrupy mouth feel. Black colour, with a frothy off-white head.
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at Shakespeare Tavern, Auckland. Pours brown with a beige head. Roasted malt, coffee and brown sugar. Medium bodied with a lingering bitterness in the finish.
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught as part of the tasting tray at the SOBA monthly meeting, a dark brown with a filmy beige head. A strong roasted coffee aroma, with touches of sweetened caramel. Plenty of chocolate in the flavour, with a moderate bitterness and a long bitter finish. An enjoyable old ale - probably the pick of the bunch from this brewpub.
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at brew pub. Black beer with a light head. The aroma is deeply malty, rich and roasted. The flavour is very bitter and richly malty. Overall a nice bitter and heavy drinking beer.
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Great beer, sweet molasses aroma, black colour and long lasting head. Complex flavours with molasses and a hint of toffee. The upfront bitterness is balanced out wit the malt and carries the high ABV very well.
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Dark brown. Fruity nose with some licorice. Sweet with soft but somewhat syprupy mouthfeel. Full bodied, with heavy notes of sugar mixed with tar. Some peppery alcohol finishes it off. Not my favourite offering from these guys.
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;Very dark brown beer with light ruby tints. Sweet and plummy aroma with a touch of sourness in the nose as well. Loads of roasted/toasted barley. Flavour starts out sweet and fruity before a bit roasty finish. Has a touch of licorice and a massive hop bitterness as well. I don’t want to call out the style police, but this is really more of an Impy Stout than an Old Ale, but whatever you call it, it’s still pretty good.
Shakespeare King Lear Old Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;Old Ale;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;On draft at the Brewery. Pours a deep, dark brown color with a thin tan lacing head. Fruity aroma, with a hint of toffee. Sense the alcohol with the taste. The better of the two beers I sampled there. It’s a beer that could grow on me. Finished off warm.

Shakespeare Pucks Fundemental;Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Shakespeare Tavern & Brewery;My barkeep told me this was 11%. Not sure about that but it sure does pack a punch. The colour is deceivingly pale as is the nose, a subtle one that belies the body. The mouthfeel is certainly huge as is the warming feeling of the alcohol. Tread warily with this one.

Empyrean Luna Sea ESB;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Empyrean Brewing Company;A little too bitter for my taste. I recognize the irony considering the style.

Empyrean Collapsar Oatmeal Stout;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Empyrean Brewing Company;This oatmeal stout’s gone Irish! The first thing I noticed about Collapsar was the nitrogen-infused texture. It makes the tan head frothy and the cocoa and coffee aromas come through nicely. The gas and the oatmeal also create a mouthfeel that is about as sleek as beer can get. While all of these technical factors are nearly perfect, I wanted a lot more flavor in this brew. The tastes are nice - rich coffee and very slight touches of chocolate - but I wanted them to be bolder and more unique. All the same, Collapsar is an above-average stout.
Empyrean Collapsar Oatmeal Stout;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Stout;Empyrean Brewing Company;This beer is almost definitely getting a boost because i had it on nitro. Black with a off white head.

Paper City Rileys Stout;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Dry;Paper City Brewery;22-Oct-13 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with 46er3498, thanks Tom!) Seven years old and still kicking, this Stout delivers flavors of chocolate bar, chocolate milk, fudge, toasted bread, and a touch of coffee. It’s medium-minus in sweetness, and roasty bitterness is quite mild. There’s plenty of chocolate and some dark, dried fruit in the nose to reinforce the strong chocolate component of the flavor. The beer is medium in weight, light-medium in carbonation, and very easy on the palate. It pours a dark-brown body with a much paler and fully transparent rim, and the dark-tan head rises to a quarter inch before settling quickly to a thin ring. Overall, I’m not sure how this beer is fresh, but with age, this is a chocolate bomb. A damn tasty one too! Very enjoyable.

Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;I find a slight sense of shame in almost enjoying this beer. Nose is milk chocolate and corn, taste is like a crappy artificially flavored chocolate beer.
Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;Dark Maroon Coloring with Big Sandy Head. Sweet, Skunky Malt Aroma. Light Sweet Chocolate - Sweet Skunky Cardboard...Diluted Flavor..Too Sweet..not a Good Chocolate Flavor. Alcohol Not Noticeable for 8.2%
Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;Deep brown color that also appears to be disturbingly high in carbonation. Very sweet chocolate and malt aroma, a bit overboard and aproaching a candy bar level of sweetness. The taste is anything but sweet. It’s like someone took a sweet chocolate bar and drizzled long expired syrup all over it, threw it in a blender and bottled it. Ugh.
Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;Was in Friar Tuck’s and saw a case of this. My daughter asked the clerk if her father could buy just one and he obliged. Very nice. However, the beer wasn’t. Poured like a Coke. Faint notes of vanilla. But wait! Isn’t this a chocolate cream? Whatever the aroma, it was thin and flat as was the mouthfeel and the flavor. Perhaps all its essences were too subtle for my senses but this was a vary bland beer. Quake? More like Quack.
Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;wow...this is not good. color is deep amber, light brown, no head. aroma is raisiny, pruny, and bitter chocolate and stale as hell. flavor has a bit of buttery toffee, but it is overwhelmed by the taste of ass matter.
Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;Man, this is probably the grossest excuse for beer I've ever tried. Funny how it smells like chocolate, but tastes like ass. Bitter and overpowering, I was unable to finish what little I had.
Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;Hazy brown hue, cola like pour but has a creamy tan head and very good lace. Aroma hinted of bittersweet chocolate, smoke, nutty, floral and fruity hops. The taste was rather bland. Mild bitterness with a almost coy sweet tone. Somewhat nice smoky and twangy finish. The mouthfeel was dry with fizzy. Hides alcohol very well. Not as bad as some of the past ratings but nowhere near what I expected.
Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;"As I drove from the liquor store, pleased that I had picked up a bargain 22 oz. beer of some apparent interest for only 99 cents on sale, I happened to listen to some Queen on the car stereo. It should have been an omen to hear ""Death on Two Legs / You're Tearing Me Apart"". Loosely formed head, quickly dissipating, to a cola appearance. Aroma is adequate--mild but hints of vanilla and sweetness. The flavor has tinges of cream soda, but is otherwise overwhelmed by metallic bitterness and a lack of anything chocolate, although I'm not sure that would have been a benefit here. What annoyed me the most about this bottle is that the label has a small image of an imagined San Francisco newspaper for the great earthquate in 1906, trumpeting that it was ""8.2 on the Richter scale"". Of course, the Richter scale was not invested by Charles Richter until 1934. Just one additional piece of evidence that this is an inadequately thought-out and badly composed beer."
Quake Chocolate Cream Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cold Spring Brewery;Black, very thin head. Some aroma of coffee. Flavor of vanilla, but none of the flavors or aromas were well done. I expected some chocolate taste but it wasn't there. Thin on the palate.

I'm currently experiencing actions contrary to swallowing...i believe that is the technical term!!! This fearless thing pours a diahhrea brown with some red and orange in the light. The head is small and non-lasting so i wont even bother with it. The aroma is sugar, a spicey peach....yeah WTF is up with that...spicey peaches..i mean come on. But let's not forget that Gluek favorite...yeah...HONEY!!!! Damn them and their honey smell! The taste borders on the worst ever. I have tasted bad beers before..i think i would place this as the number 3 worst tasting beer in history, right behind Cave Creek and Dixie White Moose. During my forced tasting, i somehow managed to gather these notes:... Tastes like caramelized sugar...artifical honey sweetnesses, cardboard and sandpaper chocolate, nasty plastic coffee beaniness, dark fruits, marhsmellows, popcorn, and lucky charms cereal. Simply vominous and horrid....i think im going to use it to get rid of my ant problem in the kitchen sink...ants like shit...so ill give it to em!!! RERATE...10 minutes later...HOLY SHIT...its actually getting worse!!!

De Roos Kerstroos;Hilvarenbeek, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Museumbrouwerij de Roos;Zurückhaltender Antrunk, in dem die Malznoten süßlich und fest, aber noch viel zu mild sind. Leider bleibt das Malzaroma auch im Mittelteil unter seinen Möglichkeiten, auch wenn es sich steigert. Für 8 Volumenprozent ist das Bier einfach zu schwach. Spät kommt die erwünschte Würzigkeit empor, die auch das Malz noch einmal steigern kann. Hier zeigt sichd as Malz auf einmal offener und lässt, wenn auch zaghaft, helle Fruchtnoten und schokoladige Ansätze hervordringen. Dieses Bier kann man noch verbessern! 10/9/9/9/10/9

La Trappe Blond;Berkel-Enschot, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;La Trappe Trappist - Abdij O.L.V. Koningshoeven (Bavaria);330ml bottle brewed in Holland at 6.5%. Dark yellow colour. Small moderate-duration head. Fruity aroma, slightly zesty, slightly banana-y. Medium carbonation. Tastes very similar to Hoegaarden, although lacking its key distinguishing ingredients (wheat, orange peel, coriander)! Perhaps it's the yeast? The malt? Is this something of a Belgian taste in general, or an Monastic style in particular? I look forward to finding out. It's not the same beer, although I bet the vast majority of fans of one would enjoy the other. The overall effect of this one gives the impression of banana bread, with some hard to put your finger on spices added. The fairly substantial ABV is utterly unnoticeable. Smooth and moderately complex, this is perhaps the best blond beer I've had, managing to be sweet without actually tasting sweet. There is no danger of sickliness here whatsoever, yet it manages to be recognisably within the blond/gold ballpark taste-wise.
La Trappe Blond;Berkel-Enschot, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;La Trappe Trappist - Abdij O.L.V. Koningshoeven (Bavaria);Very good blond beer , has a light sweet light bitter taste with a little bit of spicyness.

La Trappe Blond;Berkel-Enschot, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;La Trappe Trappist - Abdij O.L.V. Koningshoeven (Bavaria);Dark golden/light orange, hazy on the edge of murky. Medium sized dense white head, shows good enough retention and lacing. Aroma is mainly sweet fruity notes (mostly peach, plus some orange and banana) with some spiciness and a sugary background. Average intensity. Taste is very sweet with probably not enough bitterness to give balance. Sugary background, slight caramel, strong fruity notes (again, peach plus banana), slight spiciness. Decently deep, leaves a not too pleasant semi-sweet sticky aftertaste though. Medium bodied with average carbonation, with a half-creamy mouthfeel. No more than just ok.

Again a bit dull oranges flavour. A shadow of acidity backthroat. MF as mentioned above, not really enjoyable palate. Variation on a witbier? Not bad, but certainly not exciting."

A golden color it is, the head thin and white, the lace minimal. The nose light with hints of malt, so start is light to moderately malty, the middle thin and the finish a bit hop bitter and slightly dry, low to minimal carbonation was also noted. As I'm not a fan of pilsner(s), I will try and temper my rating, a drinkable beer for people who like this style of beer, for me a bit ""light""."

American Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;The main appeal to American is the cost. Its really cheap and something that poor college kids have no trouble sharing with their friends. Its inexpensive and its not terrible. It looks and smells like most other macro lagers and it is relatively drinkable. Serving type: can Reviewed on: 03-05-2007 19:28:13
Riverside Pale Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);Light cloudy amber. Tight but light head. Crisp & clean. Light Toasted malts & citric hops. Weak flavors and mineral tasting. Hard water used? Not very complex or full bodied. Disappointing.
Riverside Pale Ale;Riverside, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Riverside Brewing Company (CA);"Well bottle two from shipment one, of Michael Jackson's Brew Pub Tour. Nice deep amber color, generous beige head, and ample lace. The nose fairly malt laden, start malt sweet, the top a bit sweet, the finish slightly hop spicy, with an over all clean finish. I like this one better than the ""Pilsner"", but SNPA has nothing to fear. Medium body and moderate carbonation and the better hop presence, makes me like this beer. Is my ""BIAS"" showing?"

Goose Island Maduro;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Flight on tap at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a murky brownish hue, a bit muddy with lighter edge. Small tan head dies to a tiny ring clinger, no real lacing. Aromas are touches of sweet malts, dates and brown malt, touches of biscuits, and toast, faint toffee. A touch of dark fruit, toastiness, and maybe a touch of sweet syrupy maple. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, some sweet bready and biscuity malts, touches of chestnuts, earthy soil, touches of faint tobacco. Not smoky, but dry and toasty finish with a touch of chalkiness, some cocoa like feel, and some mellow darker sweetness into the fold. An interesting beer. Strange earthy brown ale, dry into the finish, with some mellow sweetness but a lot of dry toast, some tobacco, and soil, grass. Really interesting, sweetness kept at bay as earthy malts, dry hops, and toasty brown and bready malts do the work.
Goose Island Maduro;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Clybourn. Pours a darker cola color with a fine fizzy off-white head.

Cola vanilla toffee aroma with earthy notes...damp leaves. Sweet cola vanilla flavor with a nice bitter caramel backdrop. Feels light on the palate. Lightly carbonated but what is there is sharp. Finish unpleasant lasting bitter metallic flavor...maybe some masa in there as well...burnt tortilla? A light mess of a brown on the sweet side.
Goose Island Maduro;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);FoBAB tasting. my lil brothers favorite of the event. This was a bit on the watery side for me but was such an easy drinking beer. Poured a bit on the light transparant side, similar to a rootbeer. The aroma is of carmel and roasted malts.

Goose Island Maduro;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Clybourn and served in a MBA pint glass: Deep mahogany with a small frothy head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of chocolate, caramel, walnut, prune, currant esters, herbal hops and a hint of pipe tobacco. The taste starts with a nice twangy fruit and chocolate character with minor bitterness about. A hint of herbal spice and smoke towards the finish.

Goose Island Maduro;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at GI – Clybourn. Poured clear, deeper cola brown with a short-lived, short cap of tan head. The aroma picked up sweeter drawn caramel and chocolate along with darker fruity and floral accents.. nice and malty overall, and quite enticing. The flavor was sweeter and rather muddled.. caramel, sweet chocolate, and a touch of toffee fight each other for attention.. light roast to it, and a sweet caramel/chocolate blend on the short finish.. nice components, but it didn’t really come together. Slick on the front of the palate with sweet malts on the middle that don’t successfully fill it out.. mild bitterness. OK beer.

Goose Island Maduro;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Clear dark copper. Thin off-white head. Mix of light and fine malty flavors; caramel, brown sugar, buckwheat honey, slight roasting. Nice light hopping to give it a great in interesting balance. Nice and rounded and interestingly good brown. It isn’t a cloying malt overload and it isn’t a homebrew kit. To me, it gives a somewhat ""dismissed"" style a great name."

Big black body with a nice, two-finger thick off white head. The nose is full of roast and cocoa, with a hint of bitterness as well. The first sip surprised me, as the hops took the center stage, offering a rindy bitterness and orange sweetness to the chocolate/roast mix. Really reminded me of FFF Alpha Klaus, but not as complex. Still, a nice combination of bitter and sweet. Nice.
Goose Island XXX Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap @ Goose Cly. Pours dark brown/black with a thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and some hops. Nice roasted bitter finish. Solid Porter.

Goose Island XXX Porter;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Porter;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Goose always is strong in the stout and porter department, and this is business as usual. Roasted and robust with just a hint of sweet, its nice to have a porter that doesnt need extras like coffee, smoke, chocolate, etc. Sure those tastes are there, but natural and subtle so its very drinkable. A winner.

Asahi Stout;Tokyo, Japan;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Asahi Breweries;L: pours a gorgeous near black with a big creamy tan head. No visible carbonation. S: the aroma always reminds me of vegemite, with a burnt yeast and roasted malt. There’s a leather tinge, something slightly acidic, oats, ash. T: tastes very much of dark malt, a little vegemite. Quite a presence of oat or nuttiness. F: a really interesting feel. The body is medium. It starts with carbonated bubbles and coats the mouth in an oily way, finishing quite dry. O: a really solid foreign stout which totally surprised from Asahi. Insanely cheap in Japan too.

Asahi Stout;Tokyo, Japan;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Asahi Breweries;Bottle from Tanakaya. Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a clear black with modest tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. First aromas are roasted coffee and milk chocolate with a touch of prune. As it warms up the fruit really stands out along with some sour milk and molasses. Taste is sweet and fruity with molasses there as well. Carbonation was a little soft and the body a little too thin, but still pretty great for a macro as bad as Asahi. The price is phenomenal. Not a bad stout at all.

Australis Romanov Baltic Stout;Auckland, New Zealand;Stout - Imperial;Australis Brewing;An unepxected treat - sharing a 13 year old bottle with Keith himself. For 13 years old, this is ridiculously good. Velvety smooth, very little autolysis. The coffee notes may have ebbed away a little, but there is still plenty of chocalate and sweet malty goodness. Just need to work out how I’m going to get my hands on that 14 litre bottle now...

Australis Romanov Baltic Stout;Auckland, New Zealand;Stout - Imperial;Australis Brewing;Tasted 11/09/2007. 1998 vintage from a jeroboam. No notes, so these thoughts from memory. Oily black with a large rocky dark tan head. Roasted malt, alcohol, port-like fruit, wood and a hint of ash and roast barley sourness on the nose. I’m very pleased it’s free of infection. Good in the mouth - a great balance of sweet toffee-like and roasted malts, alcohol, a little salt and a gentle bitterness. Perfectly carbonated. A great way to finish BrewNZ 2007. Excellent. Thank you Mr Cryer.
Australis Romanov Baltic Stout;Auckland, New Zealand;Stout - Imperial;Australis Brewing;1998 vintage, jeroboam. Very privilaged to have been able to taste this. Pours a pitch black with a vibrant tan / beige head. Warm aromas of creamy fruit, raisens and a hint of alcohol, there is a oxidisation note but not one that detracts from the profile, on the contray it gives it character. Chocolate, malt sweetness and and good substantial mouthfeel characterise the palate.Leadsout on a smooth ballanced finish that features both malt, alcohol and bitterness i perfect sync.
Australis Romanov Baltic Stout;Auckland, New Zealand;Stout - Imperial;Australis Brewing;(21 Jan 06) 2000 vintage. I have wanted to try this beer for a long time so thanks Chris (Santa 2005)!

Australis Romanov Baltic Stout;Auckland, New Zealand;Stout - Imperial;Australis Brewing;Near black colour with brown head. The aroma is roasty, a bit woody, cheesy, boozy as well. Body is a bit thin, but it’s a bit old. Some smokey character with roasty accents. Too fizzy and that messes things up a bit. It does have an interesting flavour profile mind you, I just have a strong bias against fizziness.
Australis Romanov Baltic Stout;Auckland, New Zealand;Stout - Imperial;Australis Brewing;Bottled (2000 vintage). Dark black, very lively pale brown head. Aroma of chocolate and marmite.

Pours crystal clear deep golden/amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with light notes of honey, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. A bit too much fruity corn aromas, but not bad. Pretty muted. Okay aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big cracker, corn, white bread dough, and lightly toasted biscuit; with light notes of honey, pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Mild herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light honey/pepper, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Very clean on lager flavors, with minimal fruity/yeasty notes present. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Mildly increasing warmth of 7.6% after the finish. Overall this is a good malt liquor. All around nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/clean/refreshing to drink, with the mildly bitter/drying finish. Nicely clean and rich barley/corn flavors; with solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. Not overdone on adjuncts. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example. Aromas were lacking, but the taste made up for it."

Tabernash Maibock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Left Hand Brewing Company;22 oz bottle thanks to Matta. Autumn gold color with a quickly dissapearing off white head. Aroma is caramel, malt and nuts. Taste is malty all right but a bit dusty. Flavors are sweet, toasty and smooth with a mellow hop bite.
Tabernash Maibock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Left Hand Brewing Company;I found this beer in the back of a refrigerator at one of my accounts. I don’t exactly know this 22oz beers age, I’m guessing Spring 2004? Pours a rich mahogany colored body and a fluffy cream colored head. The aroma and flavor are largely malty, with big sweet fruity notes of plum, apple, pear, orange, and even some more intense flavors of raisins. I pull huge suggestions honey and molasses. There is definitely a smoky, tastiness to this bock. The body is full and smooth…It’s a really nicely balanced brew!
Tabernash Maibock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Left Hand Brewing Company;pours a very pretty deep gold with a good amount of fizz, leading to a big white head that drops quickly to a moderate ring. nose is primarily Munich malt-a sort of sweetish, lightly toasty smell. beer’s taste is great-the sweetness in the nose is suprisingly not cloying, and some spicy hops push through on the finish. drinks very smooth.
Tabernash Maibock;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Left Hand Brewing Company;Pale copper colored with very little head. Rich malty flavor, tastes slightly sweet, with light hops to balance. Decent body with a tingly, crisp mouthfeel. Not a bad bock.

Aroma is bitter lemon, orange rind, pine needles, spicy notes. Flavour is composed of aggressive hop bitterness, pine and lemon, bitter lemon, some alcohol, harsh hop bitterness.

Outstanding body here, exquisite balance between being not quite creamy and not quite fizzy, just perfect. Bready, caramely flavors are understated. Could be consumed for many hours on end, I think, as is fitting per the style.
Wizard Pendragon Strong Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wizard Brewing;Tap. Amber color. Malty, dry and altogether not a good beer...............
Wizard Pendragon Strong Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wizard Brewing;Wet, dusty, hints of gunpowder. Why do solid examples of some English ale styles smell like a 1970s sofa?
Wizard Pendragon Strong Ale;San Leandro, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;Wizard Brewing;Dullish amber hue. Light, irony, musty, cidery nose. Very smooth palate, much like a lager, but with a bit of fruity complexity. Tastes so much like Anchor Steam that I was wondering if maybe that's what the bartender accidentally poured me. Bit too fizzy for Anchor though, I suppose. Not good.
Bear Republic Lager;Healdsburg, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bear Republic Brewing Company;I got this at Jupiter in Berkeley. nice presentation, ale-ish, substantial and well-balanced. Not much nose. Crisp and clean finish. Light body.
Triple Rock Gratefull Red;Berkeley, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;Crisp, clean and fruity. A slightly hardy example of the style. Soft effervescence and a full hop finish. Soft feel and a lasting foam. This is still not coming together for me. Less than the sum of its parts.
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;Bottle thanks to MrBunn. Pours dark brown with a decent head. Aromas of Molasses, brown sugar and some oxidation. Decent flavor for how old it is. Slight sourness about it with a wet band-aid funk about it. Surely this deserves better, however considering it wont happen again.......
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;Bottle with thanks to Dave. Pours a dark brown with aromas of wood, brown sugar and a little bit of oxidation. Flavor is good enough, especially considering the age. a bit of Tartness throughout, but still a serviceable stout. A bit of soil, brown sugar and leather.
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;Bottle courtesy of tetrik. Pours a deep black with a reasonable -- surprisingly reasonable -- head. Nice roasty aroma, maybe a bit laid back, but so it goes. Somewhat thin and sour (think magdura obscura) from the oxidation, but what’s so cool is that there’s still a really good beer under here, maybe not what it was in its day, but cetainly some nice coffee and chocolate coming through, gentle sweetness, maybe a bit of cardboard in the finish. Not an unpleasant beer at all, which is really saying something after all these years.
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;12oz bottle from god knows when. Aroma has notes of roasted coffee, chocolate, and a tiny amount of dark fruit. Pours a dark brown/black hue with a very small fully disappearing brown head that left no lace. Flavor is sour oxidation right off the bat. Sour fruit juice that turns into a coffee finish. Palate is watery thin and flat. Sadly this beer is really past it’s prime and has not aged well at all. Too bad, I was hoping for a hidden jewel but got Al Capone’s vault instead.
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;"From a 12oz Bottle. Courtesy of artusory. Dark brown, opaque pour with tannic hues on the edges and a thin head of wispy tan. Aromas of chocolate, prune, and coffee roast; a pleasant dark malt combination with a sweeter nougat-like quality, but the complexity is certainly dulled by papery oxidation. Light bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel. Flavors of chocolate and mild roast, along with some raisiny oxidation notes, but thinned enough over time to be clearly past its prime. Good enough to bring back some fond memories of this beer, but sadly those flavors will never again be better than simply that. Thanks, Ryan!"
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;Pours a pitch black with a small light brown head. Aroma of bitter chocolate, sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Taste of sweet and bitter chocolate, malt and cocoa. Sourness detected. Oxidation ?
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;Bottle courtesy Nolankowal...thanks for the opportunity to try this brew. Pours a thick, dark brown with a thin head and definitely signs of carbonation. Aroma is heavy on roasted malts, roasted coffee, milk chocolate and some bits of dark fruit mixed in...very sweet overall and nice to savor. Flavor is full of sweet coffee, roasted malt, smooth chocolate, and has some slight signs of oxidation by this point in its life, but by no means is this beer drastically past its prime. Still catching some dark fruit in the background, very nice! Slightly watery on the palate, this beer still has a smoothness and pretty good drinkability. Very happy to have had the opportunity to give this one a try...still a pretty good drink!
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;Bottle. Thanks to Sliffy. What is this like 7, 8 years old? Loud ppffhhh sound when opened. Still some carbonation. Nice black body with thin head. Aroma is cocoa, chocolate, roasted coffee. Flavo ris slightly sour, coffee, chocolate, nutty and sweet malt. Thin mouthfeel. A little past it’s prim but still very tasty.
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;I’m so very thankful to moejuck for getting me this bottle! The colour was very dark brown and it had a thin fine foamed dark tan head with some soapyness. The aroma was very clear and had some roast, chocolate, and and a bit of fruityness. It had an air of age to it. The palate is a bit thin, but based upon others reactions I don’t think it’s a function of age but more of design. The flavour is of chocolate, some roast, a bit of fruit again and some soy and oxidized notes in the finsih. This is pretty decent, especialyl for being as old as it is. I do think it is a bit past its prime but has held up well. I’d love to have had the chance to try it fresh though!
Bell's Susies Sweet Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Bell's Brewery;Bottle from sliffy, thanks dan! Pours a very dark brown with a small tan head that fades leaving a nice lace. Interesting nose of dark fruits, tannins, a little soy sauce, roasted malts, cocoa and definite sherry (def a little oxidized). Flavor has molasses, more sherry, roasted malts and cocoa. Quite different from the other sweet stouts I have tasted but Im undert the impression this is a well-aged bottle. Sort of a thin mouthfeel at this point. Glad I got a chance to try it.
Saint Landelin Tripel Brune;Arques, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);Brown with tan head. Sweet faintly nutty nose. Overly sweet cloying syrupy flavor.
Saint Landelin Tripel Brune;Arques, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);I though this was terrible. The sugary sweetness overwhelmed and overall the beer was unbalanced.
Saint Landelin Tripel Brune;Arques, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;Brasserie Goudale (Les Brasseurs de Gayant);"Light brown colour w/ a touch of amber; candyish, hazelnutty aroma; brown sugar dominates a moderately cloying palate; somewhat tasty but this is far too sweet."
Kalnapilis Export;Panevezys, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kalnapilis (Royal Unibrew);500 ml can. 5.1%. BB 15/10/2014. From a gas station in Prienai, Lithuania. This is not retired by any means. I guess this new one is 5.1% instead of 5.4%. Clear yellow colour with a tiny white head. Sweetness, mango, play dough, malt and some earthy notes in the aroma. The flavour is very typical to an East European pale lager. Dry malt, sweetness, straw, mild grassy notes and just a hint of bitterness in the flavour. Blah.

Kalnapilis Export;Panevezys, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kalnapilis (Royal Unibrew);Bottled@The 1st Vaasa CS/ES beer session, thanks AK!). Pale golden colour with a rather thin white head. Aroma is quite much skunky, barnyardy, plasticpipe, mild grains and some melted rubber. Flavour is quite much similar, a very harsh brew, from which I couldn’t find all too much positive things to say.

Kalnapilis Export;Panevezys, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kalnapilis (Royal Unibrew);From a 50cl bottle. Very drinkable, but the corn-like sweetness dominates the rest of this fairly clean lager. Nothing spectacular here, but still better than most American versions.
Kalnapilis Export;Panevezys, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kalnapilis (Royal Unibrew);Pours gold with a white head. Smells soapy with some dry malty character and some peppery splashes. Tastes a little metallic at first then gives way to some airy malt and hints of subtle hops. Not bad.
Kalnapilis Export;Panevezys, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kalnapilis (Royal Unibrew);"Bottle; first beer from Lithuania. Glad it wasn’t a pale lager; that is what I thought it was when I bought it. Poured a cloudy light gold with a smallish off white head. Aroma was mainly of grain and bread; mildly sweet smelling. Was surprisingly good. Sweet and malty; some lemon. Palate was on the thin side, but wasn’t that bad. Not claiming this was all that good, but it did exceed expectations."
Kalnapilis in Ice;Panevezys, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kalnapilis (Royal Unibrew);Sour aroma. Good old cereal International Standard Lager flavor with no bitterness.

Propeller Sharp Angus;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Propeller Brewery;Medium amber colour with a moderate amount of creamy white head and decent lacing. Aroma is nutty, with a touch of caramel and bitterness. Medium bodied and smooth, with walnut, clove, and possibly honey flavours. Certainly not Propeller's best brew, but very drinkable.
Propeller Sharp Angus;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Propeller Brewery;Kindof a coppery color, white head & lace. Nice crafty maltiness with a smooth finish and slightly bitter aftertaste. Tatses nothing like the nutty hempseed beer I tried before(Storm Hemp Beer From NF)

Propeller Sharp Angus;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Propeller Brewery;Posthumously consumed. Caramel amber hue.

Propeller London Porter;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Porter;Propeller Brewery;Pint poured at the church brewing company in wolfville. Pours brown with an oatmeal (DM’s description) head. Smells malty with some coffee notes. Tastes the same but heavier on malt. Pretty darn good.
Propeller London Porter;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Porter;Propeller Brewery;Has a very nice foam on top of a dark black body. Aroma of sharp roasted barley and I can tell already it is a little watery. Flavour is sharp and sour barley, nice in fact, good balance there but just barely. And yes, it needs more fullness on the mouth. Serviceable again but no home run to be found.
Propeller London Porter;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Porter;Propeller Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Black body, small brown head. Aroma of smoke and the taste is full, very malty, roasted oak.
Propeller London Porter;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Porter;Propeller Brewery;"On tap at the brewery. Near black body is opaque with dark ruby highlights. The tan head is creamy and durable. Chocolate and coffee in the nose both reappear in the rich flavor but with faint coffee and lots of dark roasted grains. Smooth, full body. Overall; not quite up with Fullers but admirably close."
Propeller London Porter;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Porter;Propeller Brewery;Dark brown with a thick tan head and good lacing on the glass. Very nice appearance. One of the better ones I’ve seen for a porter. Light coffee and some mocha chocolate. Very smooth body and a light malty finish. Excellent beer.

Propeller London Porter;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Porter;Propeller Brewery;This is a very fine Porter. Coffee, cocoa, toasted malts, caramel and earth tickle the nose hairs with every sniff. Right before things go opaque, this beer halts its Lovibondage and tops it off with a sexy tan head. Great bittersweet classic English taste here, a very lightly oily body with mid carbonation. Pick up a six’er if you can.
Propeller London Porter;Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada;Porter;Propeller Brewery;Bottle from the brewery Pours a solid dark brown with ruby highlights and a smallish off white head that dissipates rather quickly. Aromas of roasted grain, toffee, caramel and hints of earthy. The flavor follows the aroma quite well. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation.

Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;Bottle from the brewery. Light golden with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Body is slightly hazy - unfiltered, maybe? Seems unlikely, but you never know. Aroma is odd - there’s an ale-like fruitiness there, and some yeasty qualities, along with bready malt and very faint hops. Flavour is also fruity off the top - apricot and grape juice, really weird! - before becoming typically lager-like in the middle. Hops are a bit more prominent in the finish than suggested by the aroma, but still too weak for a true pils. Such a strange beer - certainly not great or on style for a pils, but I still ended up liking it a fair bit.
Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;[2595-20091118] 341mL bottle. Fragrant hay-like yeast aroma. Clear, light orange yellow body with a quick foamy white head. Strong flower hay straw flavour. Medium body. Fair. (from the brewery)

Pours a clear light gold with a large frothy white head. Aroma’s better then the Lion Lager which I had before this: Bready malt with light grassy hops. Slightly watery flavour of, like the aroma, bready malt and light grassy hops. Average to medium bodied. A good effort."
Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;341ml bottle from the brewery, via Jay. Live rated sitting in front of my BBQ (this is why I moved to Waterloo). Light yellow, a few streaming bubbles, small white head. Aroma is nice - rich sweet light malt with some faint but present pils like hops. Taste is good - light malt body with crisp hops and a sweetness in the finish. For the price, this is excellent value, as it is one of the better made Ontario pils’ that I have had.
Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;341 bottle from brewery. Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow-gold with minimal white head. Light grainy aroma. Taste is primarily sweet and grainy with a sort of fruitishness at the end. Surprisingly decent body given how watery it looks.
Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;Bottle from secret santa. Yikes. Very thin body, rice-y and very bland, incredibly watery. Not glaringly flawed but this tastes like the OG was 1.005. There is simply nothing there. Could easily substitute for water in a pinch. The aroma has some redeeming qualities though, moderately minty and floral with some herbal notes.
Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;Bottle from matt7215. Thank you Matt! Slightly hazy yellow pour with a medium fizzy head. Pour retention and lacing. Slightly bitter grassy aroma. Taste is grass, grain and a sour fruitiness, not quite citrus. Medium body. Definitely flavor for a pale lager!
Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;Clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma is grainy, fruity and sweet. Flavour has a noticeable citrus tinge (oranges). Very clean tasting and easy to drink. Short, grainy finish with a little orange peel. A good session lager on its own merits, the low price makes it an exceptional one.
Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;Bottle from the brewery- Pours into the snifter, a gold sparkling body. Head is frothy but short lived, leaving little lace. The aroma is quite grassy, and full of lemon zest, with subtle malts and hay. This is very fresh and full of lemon and biscuit malt flavours, with malty sweetness with a good hop bite towards the finish. Spritzy, assertive bubles. A very good pale lager bordering on pils territory. If I were a local, i’d be all over this one all the time.
Gold Crown Kings Pilsner;Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gold Crown Brewery;Bottle (341ml). Via trade with Matt7215. Some bubble, tiny fizzy white head, but this clear liquid looks pretty pale and wan to me. Mild aroma, light grain (not too stale), faint weedy hops, as usual, too sweet. The taste is sweet and grainy, so that’s a plus, but I get a weird tang that stays on my tongue a long time - PVC or fresh hay - but recently dusted with pesticide. Fairly thick body, it didn’t slide down like water, that’s for sure, nice and carvbonated and a good malt body to it for a paleager/pils - nothing special, but like all the beers by these guys, clean and no adjuncts I can detect - the pvc character faded as it warmed too.
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Poured clear brown with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with fair lacing. Moderate toasted malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Sweet drinkable beer.
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;There was a little bit going on here beneath the sour, musty yeast. Namely, a smidget of cereal, a pinch of toast, a partial bread crumb, and a grain of earthy hops. The yeast is simply too much for this beer.
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"a nice hazy oragne appearance with large white head....aroma of a watered down and bland pale ale...flavor is the same witha touch of hops (pure citrus and lemon concentrate)...somewhat yeasty; okay palate....thanks to the Leopold Bros. for making a drinkable beer...FINALLY"
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Draft at the Leopold Brothers Brewery. Appearance was a white head, sparse lacing, uncarbonated, transparent, and a yellow hue. Malty and toffee aroma. Sweet, malty and chewy flavor. Mouthfeel was sticky, gummy, thick and dry. Medium bodied.
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of unnoted finely sized long lasting white colored bubbles that left behind a fair lacing. The body contained very soft carbonation, was transparent and orange in color. Its aroma contained notes of malty orange peel . Its mouth feel is initially tingly mild with a strong tingly crisp palate and a aftertaste. Its flavor contained malty hoppy notes and was. A very average brew.
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Ah the first Canadian to rate this fine brew. I was impressed I liked it. Mild aroma nothing striking but flowery. Looks red nice frothy foam that was huge and pillowy. The colour was orangy yellow and cloudy. The flavour was really hoppy and citrusy.
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;A sour edge to this that I don't care for, but the spiciness is intriguing and its very fresh tasting.
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"Yeasty and tangy, this one is hard to put a real read on. But I liked it. Ya gotta give a big score for effort on an unfiltered Kellerbier, though, don""""t you?"
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;A very interesting red lager. Pours out to a reddish-gold in the glass. Aroma is that of malt with a slight yeast smell. Taste is quite malty, but not overbearing. The hops are there, but not to the extent of say a Bell's Amber. A nice, quaffable offering that would go good with a burger or steak off the BBQ.
Leopold Brothers Red Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Bottle. One of the two bottles currently available from this brewpub. Not much red in the color (golden) but a nice foamy white head. Some berries in the aroma. A nice malty touch to a red lager. Not a whole lot of character, but this style does not expect much.
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;just bought a 6 pack of this. why do i keep buying leopold brothers’ beer? i’ve been disappointed in everything, including this one. looks exactly like a schwarzbier ought to, dark beer with a lasting tan head. but the aroma is too sour, buttery and brownie-like. more sourness--can this brewery make a beer that doesn’t have that house yeast sourness? get past the sourness, and it finishes okay....
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;So I was up at the brewery mack in March of 05 and I had what they called a dunkel. It was pretty bad. I was the first to add this beer as a dunkel but then I noticed that this beer was removed. Probably because they are calling it their schwarzbier on ratebeer. Whatever, the beer was not that good.
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;This usually good beer was a poor representation of what a schwartzbier should be. The beer has been good in the past, but how this is served is beyond me. No real nose, sour flavors. Ony thing that makes this a schwartzbier is the color.
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Quite carbonated, indeed, and good and roasty - not rounded and full like some of the better schwarzes - too much of the house yeast sourness going on - I still found it drinkable and challenging, but the house character of this brewery is getting so one note I really can't hack it anymore.
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Really dark appearance. Fairly thin but kicks like a mule. Heavily carbinated which gives a decent feel. Roasted dark malt flavors. Clean short end.
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Black as night. Thin bodied, and nice carbonation. What it lacks in body, it makes up for in rich, roasty taste and sharpness. A fine crisp lager that is true to style and very drinkable.
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"very dark with a small lasting head. Smooth and easy to drink; no bite as expected. Quality beer; looking forward to living by this place."
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"Everytime I drink a beer from this brewery, I think of the Bug's Bunny cartoon, where the orchestra is playing and everyone yell's ""Leopold! Leopold!"", but I digress... This beer pours out to a stout-like color in the glass with a nearly non-existent head. Light aroma of malt. Taste is slightly sweet and a bit thin, but makes up for in drinkability. A very easy to drink beer."
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Very deep brown color ... held to the light some amber tint, but this baby is darker then some porters. A rich cratered head sports the top but it dissapated quickly. Pronounced graininess at first sip, and some roasted overtones ... more than anticipated from this style. Has a wonderful slipperiness to the mouthfeel and the texture reminded me of melting cotton candy. A very satisfying beer.
Leopold Brothers Schwarzbier;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Thick and chewy, almost oaty, but far from syrupy or cloying. Good honest dark malts. Yumm.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Lager;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Alpine Village Hofbrau;Crisp yellow golden thin off white head, basic barley aroma, subdued, basic hint of sweet up front than mild bitter hops. Light body.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Lager;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Alpine Village Hofbrau;Bottle: Called Alpine Village Oktoberfest (Alpine Lager). Oh well. It was a light gold color, light head and lacing. Nose of rice cakes, some malt and husky dust. The flavor is crisp, malty, light dough and toast. Some fruit is there too. Decent lager.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Lager;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Alpine Village Hofbrau;Tap at Alpine Village Oktoberfest 2006. Very easy drinking. Really enjoyed this beer, probably because I had already finished a pitcher of the Alpine Bock. Standard lager. No noticeable hops.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Lager;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Alpine Village Hofbrau;Lightly clouded amber appearance. Malty, caramel slightly bready nose. Malty palate, sweet and doughy, mild bite in the finish.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Lager;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Alpine Village Hofbrau;had this from a keg at my friend's octoberfest party. Not a bad lager, but was rather devoid of flavor. actually this reminded me of an american wheat.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Lager;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Alpine Village Hofbrau;Good initial taste, kind of bready. But it loses most of the flavor into the finish. Not very hoppy. I got a 32oz. and the head lasted for days. Not great, but not bad. I'd rather drink this than do the chicken dance. Tasted at Alpine Village Oktoberfest 2002.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Lager;Torrance, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Alpine Village Hofbrau;Slight malty aroma. Very bitter taste without much hop aroma. Tasted at Alpine Village Oktoberfest 2001.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Bock;Torrance, California, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Alpine Village Hofbrau;Nearly opaque brown creamy lacing tan head. Rich nutty malt aroma but somewhat astringent.. Flavor is malty, but astringent, flawed it bites the tongue. Some nice roast malt flavors but wasted with astringency. 4 4 3 3
Alpine Village Hofbrau Bock;Torrance, California, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Alpine Village Hofbrau;dark brown in color. with a roasted malt aftertaste. tasted at the alpine village oktoberfest 2006 that guy who rated this beer before me is the asshole who took me to the place.
Alpine Village Hofbrau Bock;Torrance, California, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Alpine Village Hofbrau;Tap, Alpine Village Oktoberfest 2006. Malty with some sourness, and a bitter finish.

Leopold Brothers Octoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Leopold Brothers Brewery;from the bottle. poured a cloudy golden color with a big off white head. aroma sweet dough, malts,fruity, hops. flavor, 1st impression was yew but after I let the beer sit in my mouth I thought ok this isn’t that bad got some strange sweetness a combo of sugar and fruits followed by tartness. this isn’t like any marzen I have had. It did go down easy. but did not wow me
Leopold Brothers Octoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Tap: Lighter orange in color. Light spice aroma. Very subtle sweet malt taste. Sour finish. Not a good fest beer. More like a watery lager.
Leopold Brothers Octoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Leopold Brothers Brewery;On tap: Light citrus aroma. Orangish-gold with a small white head. Light malt up front with a moderate sour citrus finish. Not your typical Oktoberfest. Take out the sourness and it would be a watered down Oktoberfest. It’s hard to ignore the sourness though.
Leopold Brothers Octoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Draft at the Leopold Brothers Brewery. White head, sparse lacing, carbonated, transparent, and a yellow hue. Malty and fruity aroma. Sweet and malty flavor. Smooth mouthfeel. Not impressed for this style of beer.
Leopold Brothers Octoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Leopold Brothers Brewery;This draft brew from the brewery poured a very small sized head of fine to medium sized fully diminished white colored bubbles yet what was left of them lasted a long time. that left behind a poor lacing. The body contained no carbonation, was transparent and light brown yellow in color. Its aroma contained notes of mellow malt and dough. I wanted more scent out of the nose than I got. Its mouth feel is mild initially tingly with a lingering citrusy hoppy aftertaste. Its flavor was off for a Marzen. It was not a good Marzen. It is something else more akin to an ale than a Marzen.
Leopold Brothers Octoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Way too sweet all around. Nutty flavor is nice but it just gets too sweet at the end. Enough so that I cannot finish it.
Leopold Brothers Octoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"My 3rd Oktoberfest beer of the night and the least enjoyed (ABC's and grizzly peaks aren't on the site). It just didn't seem right; good at first but with an off aftertaste. Still, a good beer but by no means the brewer's best."
Leopold Brothers Octoberfest;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"This is not a bad Octoberfest. The nose is a bit sweet and floral, but very simple. The taste is quite nice. Spicey with a real ""octoberfest"" taste. Hard to explain, but I like it. Its a bit thin and perhaps a little too carbonated, but other than that, its quite nice."
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Strange, a couple summers ago, this beer tasted as the description said, with the banana and clove. Perhaps they mixed up our orders of Hefe and the new Wiezenbock, because the wiezen tasted more like I remembered the Hefe to be. Anyway, what I had was a cloudy light amber with little head. Aroma was nice and yeasty and citrusy and so was the flavour. Both this and the weizenbock were very sour, but with the fruity flavours in there, it actually worked kinda nice. Not much hops, medium-light body and flavour. It certainly is different, but I wonder how intentional all this sour beer is...
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Lots of wheat/yeast in the nose with just a bit of citrus. The taste is bland and not really that exciting. Drinkable but for the lovers of Hefe this will be greatly dissapointing.
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;This was a weird one. Farmhouse-like aroma and flavor, but also like an extreme wit. Flavors of white grapes and coriander with a pasty, musty finish and a weird, high carbonation fizzy spiced wit flavor. Tart as well. Certainly unique.
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Flavor: white grapes, honey, some grapefruit, no wheat flavors Palate: smooth but bubbly, no real perceiveable body Overall: not like a hefeweisen at all--more like a mead or white wine in both flavor, aroma, and palate. Very interesting though--very drinkable if you like meads/white wines.
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Very hazy, dimished muddy golden, smells is very nice -- good esters of light clove, body is weak -- slightly thin, and there’s a light sour that’s a bit out of place. An oily mud rests at the bottom of the glass. Props to my sis for bringing this one back from AA.
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Tap: This is one of the tartest hefeweizens I’ve ever had. It wasn’t hazy, it didn’t have a yeasty aroma. As far as I’m concerned that is near treasonous. Maybe they poured of the wrong tap or something, but I doubt it. This beer actually made me pucker. It looked like a bud light in the glass. Not again, unless they fix it.
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Hopefully I just got a bad batch because this stuff was aweful. Poured completely flat, very yellow, like a vitamin piss, overpowering citrus/pear taste that leaves a rotten film on the back of your throat. Good thing it was given to me, as will the next one have to be in order for me to try again.
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;I saw this at the beer store today, and since Ann Arbor is semi-local, I figured I'd give it a try. Pours a dark yellow/orange, but is supprisingly clear for an unfiltered beer. Smells very yeasty... Has a slightly sour, and very sweet taste to it. A decent beer, but doesn't compare to Oberon.
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;"leopolds is first off just a cool place to goto. Relatively impressed with this; had after a bells oberon at home and it was easily better. Good standard wheat appearance. The finish seemed a bit sour though."
Leopold Brothers Hefeweisen;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Bottle. Leopold Brothers just started bottling some of their beer for distribution. It is a nice brewpub just up the street from where I currently live in Ann Arbor. This one is a real treat. It has the traditional cloudy wheat look with a white laced head. A yeasty aroma and a strong flavor for a wheat. It is not spicy, but instead goes for a thick balanced approach.
Leopold Brothers Radler;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Leopold Brothers Brewery;I just don't see this as a good idea. Maybe if I were cycling ... The bottomline is that the stuff tastes like a very weak beer laced with lemon Pledge. They could probably use it to shine up those long wooden tables.
Church Brew 140 Shilling Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Church Brew Works;This poured a very dark.red, like.cola, with a beige of.head. Aroma was light smoke, dark fruited and.toffee. Flavor was.much.more.complex than I was expecting, toffee, prunes, caramel, yeast, light chocolate. Reminded me.more of a quad than a wee heavy actually but pretty tasty.
Church Brew 140 Shilling Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Church Brew Works;"Draught pint at the Moan and Dove in Amherst, MA in the company of that hop-lovin’ sour-hatin’ ClarkVV, February 19 2006, part of their ""bootleg"" series. Score! A new Scotch ale I’ve not heard tell of, with only a few ratings, from a brewpub I’ll never visit. Cool....can it live up to the pressure? Served too cold in a pint glass, but drunk slowly so as to observe the following: lasting thick off-white creamy head, lots of lacing atop the deep molasses-tarry body....aroma is lightly yeasty, peaty and earthy but really pretty weak; cold there was nothing and even after 15 minutes it has little expressiveness....very, very sweet with loads of brown sugar and maple and just a touch of bitter greens, alcohol fairly prominent all the way through to the bitter, mineralic finish....slippery-syrupy body, somewhat worty and underfermented....don’t think I finished it without a struggle. Well, it looked good."
Church Brew 140 Shilling Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Church Brew Works;Fantastic ale for winter, with fruit hints buried nicely by a rich caramel.
Church Brew 140 Shilling Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Church Brew Works;Very smooth dark and full of flavor. No aftertaste to speak of. Served in a smaller glass, but still worth the order.
Church Brew 140 Shilling Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Church Brew Works;1/2 gallon growler. Murky dark apple cider appearance. Zippo head. Light carbonation. Toasty, caramel, Goldings aroma. Thick bodied, lightly crisp and popcorn toasty. Have they changed yeasts? Or started using popcorn Pale malts? This flavor is in all their brews lately. Anyway, nice body and heavily malted with a subtle burnt aspect, not peat just roasted caramel. Fruity sweet, caramelized popcorn aftertaste and a light alcohol spiciness. Nice sipping brew but the toasty aspect is killing me, as much as I love these guys. What gives?
Church Brew 140 Shilling Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Church Brew Works;A dark brown scotch ale. dark brown beer with reddish highlights. big heavily malted tastewith a slight smoky taste and a pleasant hop finish. note this is only served in 10 oz. glasses not regular pints.
Great Adirondack Abbey Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Dubbel;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;Poured a clear amber colour with a medium foamy head. Aroma of dry fruits with some caramel malt.

Medium bodied, mild lingering spice.
Great Adirondack Abbey Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Dubbel;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;Draft at pony bar. Sweet and funky aroma. A little cider sourness, some clove, licorice, allspice. I had a funny reaction to this - liked it a lot at first, but the attraction began to fade as the bottom of the glass became more visible. This seems to happen with some people too.
Great Adirondack Abbey Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Dubbel;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;On tap at brewery. Pours dark with white head. Aroma is sweet malt and sugar. Taste is light, sugar, candy, not strong. Ok beer.
Great Adirondack Abbey Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Dubbel;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewpub. Literally, this looks like coca-cola in the glass, overly bubbly and black. It’s also sweet and sugary and drinks almost like a soda too. This is advertised as a medal winner, which amazes me. Far too far on the sweet side for me. (#5818, 10/10/2014)
Great Adirondack Abbey Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Dubbel;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;Draft. Sweet fruity base, light caramel notes, moderate spicy yeast, hints of banana, and a quick yeasty finish. Pretty good.
Great Adirondack Abbey Ale;Lake Placid, New York, United States;Dubbel;Great Adirondack Brewing Co.;Nice banana nutty aromas with some Belgian candied sugar. Flavor is a bit in the sweet side, Maybe a bit too much sugar. Nice banana, nutty and spice flavors. Low carbonation and a bit too sweet, but still a descent beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Brown ale with a thin off white head. Sweet with dark fruit and molasses flavor followed by dry smokiness and vanilla. Finishes slightly astringent and dry. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for Android
Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;On tap at The Flying Saucer (Raleigh). Pours a darker amber with a finger of head.

Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Transfer from BA reviewed on 1-27-14 - Poured from bottle into pint glass Appearance - Pours a copper/golden color with a nice white head that fades to a thin film. Smell - Pick up mostly malty sweetness with a bit of whiskey aroma almost as though an ale had a bit of whiskey poured in it, although a little more artificial. Taste - Pick up mostly maltiness at first. A little bit of caramel and toffee, but not too much, work their way in. A little bit of hop works its way in toward the very end, mostly floral and piney in nature. The whiskey taste is ever so subtle and present throughout the taste. Mouthfeel - Relatively average of the standard american ale. Overall - Right on par for an average american lager or ale, just with a bit of whiskey flavor and a little bit of hop.
Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"BB date of 6/30/12 on bottle served in a snifter. Tad of sediment at the bottom of the bottle added mid-tasting. Nonetheless, pours clear with an amber color and a thin off-white head. A good bit of splotchy lacing is left on the glass. The aroma features light-medium roasted malt with obvious notes of caramel and toffee. Pleasant, but mild and relatively simple. Medium bodied: medium carbonation; attractively smooth. Semi-dry finish. T: There may be only one variety of malt in this, but there is sufficient quantity to produce a solid malt flavor, and a good one at that. Hints of caramel, toffee, floral hops and, in the finish, light smoke. O: Although made with Scottish malt, this is not a true Scottish ale, and fits about as well in the brown ale category. Good value."
Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;I poured a 12oz bottle into an official Saranac shaker glass. Appearance: Hazy shade of dark copper/burnt umber. Some fine carbonation visible. Forms an average size, off white, foamy head which mostly dissipates but laces the glass quite well. Smell: A light scent of cereal grain with a hint of cherry, otherwise a mild nose. Taste: If I’m reading the bottle label correctly, it seems that Saranac Single Malt is brewed using just Scottish Maris Otter malt - the same malt commonly used in the distillation of whiskey and Scotch. But don’t go into this beer thinking it’s going to taste like one of those types of liquors. It’s closer to a traditional British style pub ale. A light malty sweetness all around with subtle component of dark fruit. Cherry seems to be the most prominent. There’s a gentle dry bitterness through the middle due to the use of Fuggle hops (also a common ingredient in British pub ales), and then it finishes mostly clean, but not before a very brief peat-like flavor makes itself known. While it’s not a complex palate, these flavors and the overall delivery would be handled better through the magic of cask conditioning. In bottle form it’s a very mild brew and most likely Saranac’s target audience won’t pick up on the minutia it has. That’s not to say it’s absolutely delectable, though, as the mildness is just a few shades north of bland. Drinkability: I drank two bottles of Saranac Single Malt back-to-back on a hot summer’s night and they really hit the spot. The subtle fruit flavor of the palate combined with the thin, slightly flat, mouthfeel makes it surprisingly refreshing (or at the very least just an easy beer to drink). It goes down smooth and the aftertaste is clean with just a hint of bitterness. A tad too big to session, but at only 5.5% ABV it’s no challenge whatsoever to drink two bottles.
Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Strong malty and grassy aroma, very metallic. Clear copper, medium head. Barley malt flavor, well hopped grassiness. Metallic and strangely tart. Leafy and almost vegetal. The vegetable notes become increasingly distinct upon warming.Too hoppy for the style, which normally i would enjoy, but it was more like salad than the hop varieties I prefer. Good intensity, the recipe is weird, and there are quality issues.
Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Pours deep red copper with medium head. Good but not great-worse than expected.

Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Single malt unfortunately leaves this offering from Saranacone one dimensional to my palate. Light bodied dark amber ale, with a grainy malt flavor. Unique idea for a beer, just not enough pizazz.
Saranac Single Malt;Utica, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;somewhat dissapointed with this beer, unclear aromas and flavor, preety simple taste with mild body and ending.

A cerveja tem uma cor bonita, marrom escura opaca, porém perde pontos pela espuma com baixa persistência, mas com uma bela cor castanha.

No dia anterior tomei uma garrafa com a temperatura um pouco mais elevada e parecia um refrigerante, achei horrível. Hoje deixei um pouco mais gelada e o sabor se tornou algo bem melhor.

Sun Valley White Cloud Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Draft at the brewpub... Pours standard amber with a thin white head.. smells weird like bready buttery caramel... diacetyl is pretty present.. Even a little sour, is this infected? Not good.

Sun Valley White Cloud Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Received 12-oz bottle via ABA Beer Swap. Pours a semi-clear copper amber colored brew with an average sized off-white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma of caramel and Munich brown malt, some mild fruit, floral hops and a touch of iced tea. Taste is medium bodied, a little past it’s prime with a semi-tart caramel malt with a hint of iced tea and mild spice. Finish is metallic with a short lived tart berry and caramel aftertaste. Willing to try a fresh beer the next time I am in Idaho.
Sun Valley White Cloud Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Ah! An American brew that’s not loaded in hops - quite a nice change. Reddish copper brew that poured a very small cap, but with all the fine effervecanse, a small but thick tan cap was retained thoughout the entire glass. Nice messy lacing. The aroma is refreshing with an adequate ammount of roasted malts and caramel with notable fruitness and mild hops. Taste seems pretty good initially but quickly goes bland as it cannot hold its flavour. More caramel malts. I’m not convinced if at the very very end of the taste there is a hint of metallic flavour or alcohol....I can’t decide. Mouthfeel is quite full and smooth. Medium bodied or just below. Finishes with a faint but nice bitterness.
Sun Valley White Cloud Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Horribly ugly label looks like a 1950’s ducking hunting magazine. Beer pours pure copper, with a good half-inch creamy cap that lasted the entire brew. Aroma was kind of bla yuck consisting of mild wheatyness and faint metallic hop. Taste seemed to me slightly smoky and had bitterness from some hops but the hops had no flavor, lots of oak in the flavor and the taste seems watered down. This was my first and most likely last brew from Idaho and this was thanks to beercronics parents and they’re many travels.
Sun Valley White Cloud Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;2/7/09 From the bottle. Aroma is malt forward with moderate caramel and simple, with a moderate, almost noble hop background. Appearance is clear gold with a well maintained white head. Flavor is sweet, but no caramel malt forward, watery, with medium grainy sourness and very low bittering. Mouthfeel is low bodied with a moderate carb texture. Overall, quite weak in all regards, tastes watered down.

Sun Valley White Cloud Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Draft at Old Boise Brewfest: Pours a lighter amber color with a large white head.

Sun Valley White Cloud Ale;Hailey, Idaho, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Valley Brewing;Tap at brewpub: Amber color with a patchy off-white head. Malty, too malty for an amber. Cola flavors can be picked up in this brew that doesn’t have much of an aroma or appeal to me.

Founders Red Head;Nelson, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Founders Brewery (Independent Breweries NZ);Draft at the brewery. Pours a clear amber with an off-white head. Aroma of caramel, toffee, sugar, hops, and roasted malt. Flavor was more of the same, and toasty. Sweet, and a little sticky. This one was the least impressive of the 5 I tried at Founders, but it wasn’t bad- just a bit too sweet without offering a whole lot else.
Founders Red Head;Nelson, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Founders Brewery (Independent Breweries NZ);Bottle. Pours a clear medium amber with a chunky off-white head that leaves generous lace. Now this is going to sound really odd, but the aroma was quite vegetal and brought to mind tinned tomatoes. Thinking that it was the glass, I poured it into a new clean glass. Still the tomatoes thing. Ugh. Anyway, the flavour was much more pleasant-- toasty caramel with an earthy hop finish. Very low bitterness. A decent enough amber, but that aroma was HONKING man!
Founders Red Head;Nelson, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Founders Brewery (Independent Breweries NZ);Draught at Founders Brewery, Nelson. Pours reddish brown with a small white head.

Founders Red Head;Nelson, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Founders Brewery (Independent Breweries NZ);Draught from the brewery. Pours copper/dark orange, off white head. Aromas of spice, malt, and a bit of hop. Flavour has a slight hop bitterness, balanced with a subtle malt sweetness. Some roasted malt character too. Finishes bitter and dry. A refreshing lager on a sunny Nelson day.
Founders Red Head;Nelson, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Founders Brewery (Independent Breweries NZ);Tasted on site of the fonders brewery under the hot nelson sun. Pours amber-red with malt, spice and citrus fruit aromas. Crisp hop flavours give this beer a nice kick, with substantial malt characters troughout. Subtle dark chocolate flavours take the edge off the burnt coffee flavour produced by the malt. Much prefer this on tap than from the bottle.
Founders Red Head;Nelson, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Founders Brewery (Independent Breweries NZ);(On tap) Clear, amber golden with an off-white head. Aroma of roasted malts and nuts.

Flavours are grain and harsh, agressive alcohol. Some butter with hints of fruit, especially lemon, are hiding. Then more agro. Like Kestrel Super and its ilk. Then...incredibly, towards the end of the glass it softens into a less harsh, less nasty lager, that actually isn’t too bad. Redeemed! Just.

Schutzenberger Bière sur Lie (-2010);Schiltigheim, France;Pilsener - Imperial;Schutzenberger;I have not actually met a beer that is a lager which is on lees. Also the fact that there is a degree of fruit suggests a bottle condiditoned ale.Having said that please let me contradict myself and state that this beer is clear and crisp on the pour with no cloudiness. There is a mild fruity nose but no hop aroma. The flavour feels coarse and bitter with little malt presence. Alsatians can be brutes of dogs, they might drink this.

Slick and quite creamy palate; Mouth feel is fair maltyness in a smooth and thick body. Strong honey in the background throughout. Sweetness is medium but just right, not much fruityness, warming alcohol hidden quite well. Okay… Hoppiness is floral in nose. Light lime and thin grass in taste. Bitterness is notable and moderate for a lasting, fairly astringent honey-sweet finish; Slightly dry after taste. Creamy and easy to mouth. Comments: I like how the honey is manifested in its aroma and taste, which is solid, lasting with flowery tone but not cloying. Other than its creamy taste, there’s not much elements too offer. Solid and simple, a decent one to enjoy."

Thin and slightly slick palate; Mouth feel is like a Dubbel being spiked with buckwheat with that signature yoghurty light sour taste. Otherwise maltyness is moderate to light, typical light weight dark fruit ester, light caramel, light sweetness to balance the buckwheat tartness. Strongly carboed Cola, low hop to round. Interesting… Hoppiness is lemon and sharp grass in nose. Light lime and thin grass in taste. Bitterness is typical Dubbel-ish very low-fi for an abrupt, very light astringent sour and sweet finish; Slightly dry after taste. Slightly tart and quite easy to mouth. Comments: I have no way to tell whether this “Sara” is a brune or blonde as the label doesn’t state explicitly (its black crown cap may be a hint?) so the moment of truth comes when it was popped. Unlike the Pils-like “Cuvée des Lacs de l’Eau d’Heure”, the sour tartness induced by buckwheat seems to mix well with its Dubbel base and taste. Still a little thin on malty body and palate, otherwise this is an exotic and quite a decent break from mainstream beer style. Okay."

En bouche, la gorgée, très aqueuse, offre un maltage fort torréfié épicé, soyeux et aigre-doux à l’attaque; et puis arrive une sensation lactée qui laisse le palais et la langue fort gras.

Milwaukee Classic Lager Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Boring, apart from it’s unusually acidic taste. Other than that, nothing seperating it from any other bargain bin 10$ for a 30 pack hog wash. Smells like it’s been fermenting in the back window of someone’s car.
Milwaukee Classic Lager Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);From a silver and blue 12 oz can. Ubiquitous color. Every tilt of the glass yields a small roll of visible carbonation, of course with very slight lacing. Has an almost processed rubbing alky aroma about it and that bouquet is mixed in with the typical Melanie cheap beer smells. Good quality tingly carbonation. Taste is bearable for this brand. It must be the water they use over there, allot of the Melanie brews carry that same discernable flavor. You know, the metallic processed background. Not nearly as bad as jaguar but it is still there. Not enough to trigger the gag reflex, yet. Fifty-four cents a can. Finish is manageable but it leaves a weird cardboard sensation unlike coors NA. This is a one time case deal. Unimpressive but cheap. Read Franks’s rating below. MIL CLASSIC LIGHT S3L1F3T4O9

Pale straw color with a nice white fizzy head. Perhaps everything is better because most of my candidates are winning. No not really. Lots of corn and a touch of grain and husk in the aroma. Quite weak. Alcohol and touch of metal i it warms ever so slightly. I see one of the races tighten. This stinks.

Milwaukee Classic Lager Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);One word describes this beer, terrible. Not one good thing can be said about it, not even the look of the can. But in all fairness, funds are tight, and it is beer, so I’ll drink it.
Milwaukee Classic Lager Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Under-rated for a light beer. Given that it is crap but it does not taste much worse than most lower end light beers. Only good in great quantities.
Milwaukee Classic Lager Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"I’ve rated over a thousand beers on this here site and have come to the conclusion that the very cheapest beers are frequently the most fun. Take this lovely slice of ass for example: the mere challenge of trying not to wince upon first tasting this is enough but if you should succeed you have the added fun of convincing your friends to try it too. Of course, if they see the face you truly want to make, it’s a lost cause; you will likely have some difficulty convincing them not to call the paramedics. In the end what we have here is a remarkably bad example of a cheap American beer. What ultimately should be flavorless and inoffensive comes across as flavorless and offensive. It’s the worst of all worlds folks. But it’s cheap as nuts so it comes highly recommended from yours truly."
Milwaukee Classic Lager Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"One of the worst lights I’ve had. Yellow with a small head.

Schlafly 80 Shilling (Eighty);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Scottish Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Cask pint at the Tap Room. I swear this beer looked almost too good to drink. Pours a clear dark amber with that thin small bead head that coats the glass, typical of cask beers. Aroma is mild bread and nut shells. Taste is sweet caramel malt and buttered biscuits, maybe some maple syrup as well. Classic stuff.
Schlafly 80 Shilling (Eighty);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Scottish Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;8oz Draft A - Pours a clear copper with a one finger off white head. Ok lacing. S - Sweet bread.

Sweet finish that drys out quickly. O - Sweet but tasty. A sessionable Scotchish Ale.?
Schlafly 80 Shilling (Eighty);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Scottish Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Pint at the taproom. It poured a hazy reddish/copper color with an off-white head.

Schlafly 80 Shilling (Eighty);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Scottish Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft at the Tap Room. Very good beer. I’ve seen this here several times and always wanted to try it, but never got around to doing it. Now that I finally have, I wish I would have got a growler of it. Something I’ll have to do next time.
Schlafly 80 Shilling (Eighty);St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Scottish Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Pint at the Tap Room. This pours clear and coppery. A one plus finger off white head. Thevnose is fruit from the hops, grain, and soggy malt. I taste the fruit first. The hops are subdued but nice. Malt is multi layered and includes a tiny dash of cocoa. Cinnamon is noted and is also light. Alcohol seems ablittle higher than listed. This is tasty, subtle, and nice. Very enjoyable.

Great caramel/toffee malt focus, hint of roasted grain, low flowery and earthy hop balance. Slight residual sweetness, maybe a hint of beneficial diacetyl, faintly fruity ale yeast esters. Tasty and 100% true-to-style, reminiscent of English Mild Ale, my favourite style of all. Medium body, well-rounded mouthfeel, great malty aftertaste. I had it on forced CO2 draft as well as cask-conditioned. Needless to say, the cask version was even a little better and more complex. Surprisingly delicious, probably my favourite of the day. UPDATE: Tasted again on cask through Angram beer engine at the Tap Room, and must increase my rating yet again. A near perfect beer in every way, especially presented in this fashion.

Two Brothers Bare Tree Weiss Wine 2000;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Two Brothers Brewing Company;"2000 Vintage / Rating #2300 4/06/2010: Two Brothers Bare Tree Weisse Wine 2000... Aroma: Caramel and honey with some oxidation; rum-like alcohol; light berry/fleshy fruitness; hints of butterscotch and over-toasted pecans when warmer. Appearance: Orange to golden amber color; slightly hazy; minimal beige head that is mostly lasting; sediment is suspended in the thick, nearly still liquid (there are only a few bubbles zipping to the surface periodically). Flavor: Sticky toffee maltiness, good level of sweetness (on the sweet, malty side without being cloying); dark honey notes; caramelized sugar and citrus hard candy; nice alcohol burn and venting through the nose; the finish is a bit more dry and earthy; melon flavors and fleshy fruit flavors are no longer present (as found in later vintages); oxidation and pruniness is barely noticeable in the flavor; the alcohol is nearly completely hidden in the flavor; softens up when warmer with a bit rich caramel and bits of creamy butterscotch and milky caramel. Palate: Medium-light and a bit fizzy (although this seems to disipate as it ages), yet smooth overall; a bit chewy and very enjoyable. Overall: VERY good considering the age; I am quite satisfied with this beer! 1 oint, 9.4% fl. oz. bottle (filled 1"" from the top of the bottle!) from via trade. Thanks ! Rating #21 for this beer."

Pours a hazy amber color with a few floaties throughout and a small white head. The aroma had a large amount of sweet fruits, dark varieties and citrus, caramel malt that is almost candy like, and a touch of spice. The oxidation does not detract from the beer. The flavor is sweet caramel/toffee, ripe fruits, prunes, slight amount of spices and some oxidation. Medium-full bodied. This has held up pretty well all things considered.

Two Brothers Bare Tree Weiss Wine 2000;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to jeffin7: Pours to a very cloudy dark amber with a medium light tan head. Visable in the body are small and rather large particles, with small bubles rising quickly to the surface. The aroma is fresh ripe apples, apple juice, strawberry seeds, light clove, light toffee, peach, apricot, sugar-coated wheat. The taste is sweet cereal, wheat, and very fruity with notes of apples, peach, pear, vanilla, apple cider, with bit of applejack liquer, rum, the alcohol notes come through after a couple of sips towards the finish. Very effervescent, medium bodied, lively carbonation, would be syrupy and probably too sweet if the lively bubbles did not cut through the sweetness. Finishes with extended caramel apples, sugar, and some tart wheat and earth notes.

Mt. Hood Pittock Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Government Camp, Oregon, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mt. Hood Brewing;This is the BEST Winter beer period! It could be the best beer anytime if it wasn’t only available seasonally in the Winter. I have been an advocate for this beer since I first tasted it about 8 years ago. I have had a personal keg of it for the last 4 years and look forward to its release every October. Everyone, young, old, wine drinkers, beer drinkers, whomever has tasted this has either liked it or raved about it as well. I’m certain it could be a very hot seller if it was more widely distributed and advertised. I’ll never miss a Winter without it if I can help it! It is a full, rich, wonderfully complex flavor and also terrific appearance.

Mt. Hood Pittock Wee Heavy Scotch Ale;Government Camp, Oregon, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Mt. Hood Brewing;(Draft: Mt. Hood Brewing Co. in Government Camp, OR) Hmm, once again, the aroma is sweet and fruity, like many of their beers I’ve tried so far, but also very peaty. Fortunately, the sweet, fruity flavor is equalled by that same smoky, peaty maltiness, and a woody character that is reminiscent of wine barrels. While quite sweet, there’s a pleasant tartness to balance out the sweetness some. Full bodied, round on the palate, and long-lasting. Dark amber color is slightly hazy. Light tan head fades to a thick ring, leaving droopy, patchy lacing on the glass. The tartness is a bit unusual for the style, but overall works well and the beer is quite enjoyable.

BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;Quad-like dry fruit-sweet aroma with some alcohol notes. Pours a brownish-amber with decent off-white head that settles. Moderately sweet fruity taste fading quickly to earthy maltiness. Thinner body. OK but the maltiness is just meh. Notes: bottle pour
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;Definitely one of my top 5 winter/Christmas beers! Drink it every year and never disappoints! Living in Portland this is always a local staple come winter season! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;"Almost no head on top of pretty dark brown brew. No lacing to speak of. Smell is like most run of the mill PNW winter ales (I think I need to change things up). Caramel, roasted and toasted malts with enough hops (citrusy) to balance while still making it feel ""warm"". Taste is again pretty standard ... still pretty good though. raisins and rum cake... nice and warming ... definately makes me think of Christmas."
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;Amber body, tanned head. Feint nose of candi malt with accompanied by fruitiness and a touch of wet shoe. The body is of watered down candi malting and diffuse fruitiness. Pretty lackluster.
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;"rated based on notes taken 12 aug 2012 -- from a bottle; decent winter ale, not extremely impressed, not at all disappointed."
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a slightly hazy lighter mahogany-brown color with a one finger head of tan colored foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the beer heaviest of a sweeter caramel and darker fruit smell of cherry and raisin. Along with these aromas comes notes of caramel and some spice is there as well. Taste – The taste begins with a sweeter dark fruit flavor of cherry and raisin, just as the nose would have suggested. Along with these flavors are some lighter roasted malt tastes, which grow stronger and stronger to the end of the taste. The fruit while heaviest upfront, is later overtaken by a caramel and slightly bready taste. A hint of a boozy rum flavor and some spice flavors develop later in the profile, melding well with the sweeter caramel and fruit to leave a nice warming flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that was rather average. Overall the feel was rather good for the fruit, syrupy and warming tastes of the brew, although just a hint less carbonation may have been slightly better overall. Overall – This was a very tasty brew overall, with a great drinkinability nice light warming feel and just enough spice to balance the sweet.
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;Serving: from bottle on Horizon Airlines. Aroma: lightly sweet, malty aroma. Appearance: average-sized, frothy, off-white initial head with fair lacing and mostly diminishing longevity. Clear, dark-red body. Taste: lightly sweet initial flavor and lightly sweet, roasty finish with average duration. Palate: medium bodied with oily texture and lively carbonation. Overall:
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;Bottle. Pours a hazy reddish brown color with a moderate tan head on there. Some hay and subtle toffee notes are coming through for me. Taste is lighter than I expected, with some toasty malts being most salient, and a mildly bitter finish. Not too bad.
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;Opaque medium brown pour, not much head. Carmel malt in the nose with a whiff of alcohol. Sweet. Middle is cola nut, coco, malt. Finish is bittersweet.
BridgePort Ebenezer Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - English;BridgePort Brewing;651 ml. bottle. Pours a medium thick, well retained, tiny bubbled ivory head, with slight lacing, over a clear, dark amber (SRM 15) body....nose is light toffee/caramel from the toasted malts, light dried fruits with hints of plum, raisin, no hops....taste is lightly sweet, with toffee/caramel hints, light dried fruits, finishing dry with hints of hop.....mouth feel, light of medium body, slight alcohol, light carbonation. This is a very light and simple example of the style. It need a great deal more in malt complexity and strength in both aroma and flavor. It is not a bad beer, just not a very good English Strong Ale. It really could use more caramel/crystal malts. BJCP 6/3/12/4/6

Mousse assez, col moyen et durable. Assez effervescente, bulles moyennes à grosses. Odeur d’herbe, de foin. Douce et un peu amère, pas sucrée. Goût déplaisant d’herbe en finale.

Schutzenberger Schutz Jubilator (-2006);Schiltigheim, France;Bock - Doppelbock;Schutzenberger;Bottle, unfortunately this beer is no longer available since 4 years. It was one of my favorite.

Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;Bouteille. Nez de grains de malt et citron léger. Goût légèrement malté et sucré lors de l’entrée en bouche suivi d’un goût de maïs et d’un léger goût plus âcre et aux notes amères de houblon herbeux (gazon mouillé). Arrière-goût très légèrement sucré et très court. [notes 2004]
Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;"Originally rated April 2004. A nice bottle, but this ice beer made in France looks more like it’s made it Egypt. Other then that, not much of this beer. Light gold colour with a small head. Can’t smell, nor taste much. Just plain refreshing, like water. Says ""The freshest beer in the world"" on the back of the bottle. I guess they use pretty good water."
Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;Picked up at a bottle shop in Pawley’s Island, SC... Appears a clear, straw toned light yellow with a small white head that quickly fades into a fizzy cap. Light lacing is left. Smell is of skunky grass, creamed corn, and wet hay. Taste is of the same skunky, corn husk and hay that’s just not appealing. Mouthfeel is musty with the skunky must shining through. This one probably makes better toilet bowl cleaner than a palate cleanser.
Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;330ml bottle shared courtesy of weeare138. Bottle labeled best before 07 09 06 (oh, oh).

Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;Poured a pale golden color, thin white head, with faint lacing on the glass. Aroma of skunk, metal, and crotch. Taste was a bit doughy, maybe some toffee, with corn, metal, and just overall bad.
Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;Thank to weeare138. Pour a translucent golden with a smaller bubbly white head that left some lacing. Aroma of piss, grass, sweet malts, corn… Flavors of corn, sweet cereal malts, stale hops and not much else that is appealing.
Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;Light golden with a medium white head. Aroma of malt with some sweetness. Flavour is fresh, malty with some lemon, nice hoppiness. For a pale lager it has a good maltiness.
Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;Intriguing bottle, but that is all there is to say about this terrible beer. Very mettallic finish to this beer and there isnt much flavor to it
Schutzenberger Tütz;Schiltigheim, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Schutzenberger;Bottled: This beer is quite artifcial. Some rodden apricot and rice are present in the flavour. Finish is metallic. Horrible beer.

Abbaye d'Aulne Blonde des Pères Sur Lie;Gozée, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;From Jun 2007 This one pours from 750ML corked and single strapped cage bottle(best by 9/26/07) a cloudy straw colour with a very small head of foam(room temp) that surprised me. I thought there'd be a good head of foam and what I got shrank very quickly to a ring around the glass and there's little to no lacing. A few minutes later and there's no foam in my glass at all. The smell has a good hoppy and spicy nose to it. I also get some clove and a bit of malt. The taste is kind of hoppy up front with some yeastiness, clove and other spice backing it up. I can also taste some candy sugar. The finish ends up on somewhat of a funky side, which I normally like, and then it peters out and gets a bit on the watery side. Hmm...For me, this is a pretty average Belgian Pale Ale and, quite frankly, one I'd not seek out again. Still...I'm glad I tried it and it's worth a go at least one time.
Abbaye d'Aulne Blonde des Pères Sur Lie;Gozée, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;Hazy orange color with white head. Aroma is malty, a bit caramelly. Taste is medium bitter, and there is some sweet notes. Fizzy carbonation. Reminds me of weissbeer. Pretty good.

On est donc sur une blonde basique. Mon exemplaire est juste à date, c’est-à-dire qu’il a certainement une bonne année de bouteille. Couleur blond doré à reflets sombres, avec un léger voile. Bulles fines partout, pas très nombreuses, mais vives. Mousse blanc cassé à relief de marécage. Joli. Arômes de blé, houblon, froment, avoine, pointe de seigle. 1ère bouche souple au très bel ensemble malté, avec des fruits blancs. Arrière-bouche bien pleine, maltée, équilibrée. 2ème avec un beau malt et de très belles nuances. Arrière-bouche très ronde, souple. 3ème au magnifique ensemble malt/houblon/fleurs des bois. Arrière-bouche très équilibrée, avec une pointe de baies blanches. Longueur avec une belle rondeur, une grande beauté du malt, pointe de miel et du bois blanc. Jambes fines bien marquées. Levure douce, fine, très belle ligne. Finale à la texture remarquable, avec des saveurs encore à découvrir. CONCLUSION : une bière avec énormément de rondeur, beaucoup de saveur, toujours en équilibre, et un allant crescendo parfait. Pour ce niveau de blonde, c’est un sans faute.

Abbaye d'Aulne Brune des Pères Sur Lie;Gozée, Belgium;Dubbel;Brasserie de l'Abbaye d'Aulne;330 ml. bottle @ home. Procured from Willems & Zoon. BBF 03/04/2015. Really crappy label. Light red varnish dark brown mahogany beer, small beige head. Nose is sticky paint, rotting berries, fermenting red fruits, artificial raspberry & fruit wine, weird. High carbonation, paint, sticky plaster, syrup, fermenting plastic berries, cheap grainy chocolate, light molasses. Odd brew, makes me think of paint etc. quite a bit.

Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;"Sampler at the brewpub - Not served under this name &#40""Dark Horse Stout""&#41, but is was a ""plain"" stout that will fit here nicely. Pours a very dark black/brown in color with a small tan head. Aroma was roasty with coffee and chocolate. Flavor is actually quite good... slightly sweet with plenty of dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Not bad... definitely the best of the flight of samples in this session."
Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;"Ok the waitress called the stout I drank a ""socialist stout""...so I am guessing that it is this one. Black pour wtih a small brown head. Chocolate and coffee on the nose with some good roastiness. Flavor is a tad sweet and has a good mouthfeel. This was my favortie beer of the 6 I tasted."
Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Above average carbonation. Odd water here is noticeable in this one throwing the taste off. Wisp of head on black opaque. About average mouthfeel. Chocolate malt in the aroma, finally aroma. Sourish but also a bit of taste, whinish, until oddness wears you down.
Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Good Head with a Dark color like coffee. Really Smoky Taste, meaty with hints of coffee.
Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Well this has obviously improved a lot. Arrived black as night with a creamy nitro brown head. Aroma is roasty with milk chocolate and burnt toast. Body is med. heavy. Flavors are spot on. Lots of milky choclate and dried fruits. Best beer they had. I couldn’t have asked for a better stout, OK I could have but you know what I mean.

Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Rich roasted aroma - slight hints of coffee. Roasted flavor - maybe a hint of smokiness?. Finished with a strange unidentifiable flavor. I definitely don’t think it was as bad as some of the other reviews here - perhaps the Shed is improving. Overall I thought it was a rather generic Irish Dry stout - just a little weirdness from that finishing flavor.
Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Roasted malts and an odd twang in the nose. Dark brown with thin tan head. Very unpalatable and thin flavour and body led me to question whether this may be infected. Server informed me that no one else was complaining so it must be just me. Perhaps that was because everyone else at the bar was drinking Bud or Corona. Left the rest of the pint untouched and went elsewhere. On tap at the brewpub in September 2003.
Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Dark Chestnut brown and fizzy around the head. Moderate bittersweet aroma. Plum/grain/berrys. Has too much bare spice flavor in the nose which is unbalanced with the lack of body. Hops flavor seems stale and again, which seems a problem with the Shed, leaves the palette watery. Stick with mountain ale if you are drinking at the Shed.
Shed Smugglers Stout;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Stout;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;"Dark brown, not quite opaque, no head really; looks thin for a stout. Some nice faint roastiness in the nose and licorice; hmm not bad but not good, is this going to turn out better than the other Sheds? Naaah, just awful grape juice/blueberry/licorice flavors, artificial at that, with NONE of the roastiness, chocolate, coffee that you associate with a stout. Like an off fruit wine more than anything else. Very thin. I tell you, after my experiences the last few weeks at brewpubs in ski resort areas, I gotta wonder about the tastebuds of people on the slopes..."
Shed Pumpkin Porter;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Porter;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;"2001: Decent porter, with strong alcohol presence only real detracting point; very smooth finish. Pumpkin flavor is very indistinct; supposedly much stronger when warm, but we were running late and couldn't spend the time it deserved to warm up that much! 2004: absolutely no pumpkin aroma until quite warm, and then only a hint to go with light cheap chocolate; on the tongue, just a hint of milk chocolate that quickly turns to sour, infected grape juice. More garbage from the worst brewere in Vermont."

Frederick Scholz Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"Absolutely no excuse!!!!!!!!!! Tasted like a really bad watered down light beer. I haven’t had anything that bad in a long time. Possibly the worst beer I’ve had; and I’ve had some really bad beers. Watery, flat, and just plain old foul."
Frederick Scholz Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Nothing at all a beer worth mentioning. Pretty much a beer that is a rough combination of fruitish and cornish, with just a glimmer of hops towards the end. Price gave it two extra points on the overall. Vaguelly similar to Joe haslinger's
Frederick Scholz Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Pale yellow. standard beer aroma of a cheap product. Flavor was mild and had some hops, which added quality and some taste. Better than many other super economy beers.
Frederick Scholz Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;To say that it is maybe the worst beer I've ever had is a gross understatement. You honestly have to try this to fully appreciate just how God awful this vile liquid is. It is litterally unbelievable. Not only could I not finish the beer, I couldn't swallow the first sip. It was the first time I've ever spit out a beer. I just don't understand how you could make this.
Frederick Scholz Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;I participated with funk and the iceman in gagging on this swill. I don't know who Frederick Sholz is but he is need of an ass beating for creating this piss-like liquid.
Frederick Scholz Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;If this wasn't one of the worst I've had i don't know what is. Myself and Funk split a 12 with some friends and it was a general opinion that this stakes a claim for the worst of all time.
Frederick Scholz Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Just plain bad..............................................................
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"I would love to state that this is a great beer to get hammered, but I can't even say that. It left me with multiple headaches, bad taste in my mouth, and should have never been stocked by Albertson's despite having such a low price tag. This is truly a statement of ""you get what you pay for"", I paid close to nothing for this beer and in return it gave me nothing good in return. I am sincerely happy I have never seen it on a shelf again."
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Honestly, this could be a lot worse. Very light flavor, mostly sweet malts but not too sweet, with a tiny bit of actual hop flavor.
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Judge this beer by what it is. Anexample of a post-prohibition lager. Considering the price, it really a bargain. The aroma is low hop but malty and clean with a distinct corn aromss. Appropriate to its style. The mothfeel is full with residual body from its corn component but without any off flavors. The appearance is deep gold and clear. The best feature is its drinkability. For a corn adjuncted beer its flavor is clean and pleasant. There is no starchy residue on finish but the malt balance is shifted toward sweet rather than hop bitter as I would prefer. For a beer of this price I am higly impressed. Its not great beer, the style its in is not great beer but its very pleasant and a good example of what it is. And...Its cheap. By the way,I joined this site to rate this beer...it seems to be misunderstood by most of the other raters.
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Dude, this tastes like assyeast. I can’t call it anything else. It’s just purely offensive to drink.
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Okay, I joined RateBeer to give this review - I hate cheap beer usually, but sometimes I gotta go old school for nostalgia’s sake and pick up some Blue Ribbon (etc.) - I’m 2 beers into this Reibenbach 12 and it’s not that bad for cheap beer. - the corn and rice reminds me of High Life, which I can handle once in a while. The can is very well designed and I have to admit, it was 99% of the reason I picked this up.
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This might possibly be the most watered down beer ive drank. Ugly piss yellow with a tiny fizz head. Aroma is just like the flavor, corn and rice and really disgusting. It may be dirt cheap but thats how it taste also.
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Sweet and somewhat sour. Very light golden yellow in appearance. Watered down taste. Cheap beer with a cheap taste.
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Pale yellow. Fizzy head. Nose of sweet malts and lemony citrus hops. Slight hint of corn. Wow. That isn’t very stimulating at all. Sour grains and slightly bitter citrus flavors. Watery. No discernable palate whatsoever. I concur with Jordo on this one. BOOOO! or something.
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Can: Clear watery fizz, very light straw yellow. Nose of corn, fusel alcohols, grainy, floral hops. A metallic sharp watery taste with mild grainyness. Fairly boring and not fun. Booo!
Charles Reibenbach Lager;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Tastes pretty lousy. It has a weird taste like some malt liquors, but lacks the kick or the strength. Was $3.99 for a twelver, so I don’t feel too bad. The cans do look cool though.
Church Brew Where Theres Smoke...Theres Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Church Brew Works;On tap at CBW. Decent beer but can’t match top beers like the Alaskan smoked. Dark brown body with an unusually white head. Aroma and flavor are nice and smokey but little in the way of complexity. Good if you’re looking for just a nice smokey brew but could use some more malt character.

Bell's Rye Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout;Bell's Brewery;I haven't tried the Kalamazoo yet, so can't really compare this to that, but from the reviews I'm seeing they could be similar. Contrary to most craft beers that I've been sampling (particulary stouts and porters), I noticed the hops first then the malty flavors more at the finish vs. malts first and hops at the end. The malty flavors were mostly chocolate, caramel, coffee (the bitter kind), and some sweet stuff like toffee towards the end. I noticed the rye in the beginning mixed in with the hops....giving a bitter-sweet taste....followed by the malts of course. This is a solid stout, not one of my favorites, but solid nonetheless.
Bell's Rye Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout;Bell's Brewery;aroma is roasted grain. flavor is coffee, oatmeal, and some milk. a little thin on flavor. had a growler pour at home. not bad.
Bell's Rye Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout;Bell's Brewery;On draft at Bells for All Stouts Day. The pour is a thin watery dark brown with a hefty bit of visibility through it. The aroma is nutty and spicy with a hint of malt and light bitterness. This is plain and not good. The flavor is equally disappointing. There is a light malt and a hint of spicy rye but that’s about it. This isn’t good. The mouth feel is thin and watery with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly malty finish. It’s interesting. Not good.
Bell's Rye Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout;Bell's Brewery;Rye in a stout is a little less noticeable than in an ipa. Totally a solid stout. Other than that, I dont know what to say.
Bell's Rye Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout;Bell's Brewery;Meh..... Doesn’t really smell at all....looks good....tastes like roasted rye and nothing else.

Fegley's Brew Works Pumpkin Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Fegley's Brew Works;I had it on tap. It pours an amber color with a nice white head. The aroma is pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The taste is pumpkin, bread, and spice. It’s balanced very nicely. Every aspect of the taste is right on point. It has a nice full and creamy texture. This might be the best pumpkin beer I’ve had this season.

Fegley's Brew Works Pumpkin Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Other;Fegley's Brew Works;Clear amber with decent white head. Distinctive pumpkin spice aroma. Sharp bite of spice that slowly fades in the flavor. Not much else here. Would prefer more body and malt to this autumn style.
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a tulip because I thought this was a Belgian ale. The appearance was a hazy sort of copper color with a finger’s worth of quickly dissipating head. Mild stringy lace. The aroma had some apricot, dough/white bread, light hay/grassiness, some bubblegum and a touch of herbal quality underneath. The flavor was moderately malty sweet with the apricot super sweet and the grassiness coming across really dry. Apricot sweet aftertaste flowing into the finish. The palate was about medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine. Overall, I wanted to like this one, probably based on the idea, but somehow seemed like the apricot didn’t want to blend as well in the flavor. Also, I missed the memo - there was coriander supposed to be in this?
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Allentown. Pours a medium copper with some chill haze and a thinning head. Aroma is medium apricot essence, seems slightly fake, with some doughy toasted malts, wheat character, yeasty phenolics and even a hint of salt? Flavor is more apricot with some pineapple it seemed, crackery dull malts, and light peppery yeasty spicy notes. A slight bit slick.
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap at the Bethlehem location. Poured a medium golden color with an averaged sized off white head. Yep, aromas and tastes of apricot and coriander/spices.
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Draft at Allentown Pours a good amber gold with a white head. Aroma is definetly fruity with the major one being apricot. Flavor was apricot with hints of spicies. Had good carbination and an alright mouthfeel. Light bodied and a decent finish. This is not what I would seek out in a beer but it really was not bad.

Aroma is mild apricot/peach, medium malt. Taste is apricot/lemon/peach pit, medium malt, coriander/somewhat sweet, peppery. Finishes slightly tart/tangy/grass, Ok effervescence. Slightly syrupy mouth feel, medium body.
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap at Bethlehem locaiton. Pours a translucent copper with golden notes and a medium creamy white head that laced. Aroma of light apricot, Belgian yeast esters, bready malt and a touch of the coriander. Flavor of dougy malt, very like corriander and apricot and Belgian yeast spicy notes there as well. Kind of reminds me of a Belgian single ale with just a faint touch of the fruit and spice.
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Draft at BBW. Medium goldish pour with very little off-white head. I got a spicy and fruity aroma, with definite apricot and some pale malt. The flavor started spicy, and then the apricot kicked in, all the while retaining a very refreshing quality. Medium to light palate heft.
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Hey, I’ll admit it, I liked this one. The appearance was the weakest part, very little head and no lacing. The aroma was spicey, coriander most prominent over the light fruity aroma (although w/o the description, I couldn’t identify apricots specifically). Flavor came across as a witbier with apricots lightly mixed in (again, the fruits didn’t dominate this one). A little more fruity and sweet than the average witbier, but a neat twist on the style. Couldn’t drink as many of these strait on through, like I could wits, but a nice finishing drink.
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Pours orange with a thin white head. Smells of coriander and oranges. Taste is initially soappy before mellowing out to reveal the apricot.
Fegley's Brew Works Apricot Coriander Ale;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Not much aroma. Cloudy yellow color. Hint of apricot aroma. Mildly spicy taste from the coriander. Couldn’t really taste the apricot at all. Not a bad beer, but taste was not not pronounced enough.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;6 oz draft pours golden with with a white head. Aroma of fruit and yeast. Taste is fruit, malts and yeast.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;Draft at Eulogy. Very dark cloudy red brown pour with a slight off-white foam. Deep dark raspberries. Medium sour. Dark red/brown fruit. Nice full body for the style. Interesting rotted raspberry notes. Though not much else beyond that. Intense and rich. Thankfully much more sour than sweet. Full and refined. Being nitpicky but still seems to be missing a balancing element.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;Notes from 1/8/12...Reddish brown in color. Very sweet aroma. Taste is is tart raspberry. Very creamy body which was nice. Very acidic and tart. Odd aftertaste, woody, whiskey like. Was hard to finish cause of sweetness and disfavorable aftertaste, but kind of grew on me at the same time. Nonetheless, one go at this is good enough for me.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;I have to admit I was slightly impressed with this. I really just expected this to be another Raspberry ale checked off with a name of Framboise. I was pleased with the color first and foremost, but some acid in the nose, followed by some sour funk in my glass, with some very rustic dark fruits in the finish. A tad bit on the lighter side and could use some tweaking, but not bad at all.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;Huge acidic flavor with a mellow raspberry influence and a decent amount of funk.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;In bottles at Sour Sunday, Triple Rock. Very pleasing color. A slight hint of DMS in the nose, but not unpleasant to taste. Very spritzy. Lemony/citrus acids predominate in the taste profile, but there is definitely some berry notes in the background. Very much in the lambic style, this beer finished very dry and was on the light-to-medium bodied side of the palate.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;Draft at brewpub. It has a sharp acidic punch which quickly subdues. Descent fresh raspberry flavor. I’d drink it again. I love to see brewpubs branching out and doing lambics.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;(Draught) Pours a murky reddish golden with a small white head. Aroma of raspberry, earthiness, mustiness, cheese, and grain. Flavor of sour raspberries, earth, and caramel.
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;"Sampled GABF 2008 The beer has a murky, light amber color and is topped by a white colored head. This has a woody, almost grassy nose to it that is clearly derived from raspberries but sot of accentuating all the wrong notes. Other aromas of musty cellars, light notes of overly ripe, funky cheese and a lot of malt character; more grassy notes, but grain this time as well as a solid cracker like aroma. The flavor is tart up front, though not overly so and is actually quite light if this was trying to be a Lambic. The body is quite thin and watery and is lacking in the body that I would expect from a well made sour beer. Again there is lots of grain character here in the flavor, which does seem a bit out of place, but contributes notes of grassy grain and lots of cracker-like whole grain flavors. The raspberry flavor here is noticeable, but it is quite light and most definitely watered down. This definitely gets quite funky at times as I do believe this tastes like vomit. Unfortunately this is really not very good."
Fegley's Brew Works Framboise;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Fegley's Brew Works;GABF 2008. A hazy dark gold pour with a malty, faintly raspberry aroma. Minimal funk & sourness there but malty. The body had much more tart fruit in it, but still very grainy for my tastes.

Mohegan Sun Matahga Lager;Uncasville, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Race Book Brewpub at Mohegan Sun;On draught at the casino, 5/18/2005. Medium-brown color, some dark orange and dirty copper tones. Head is small and off-white, and recedes to cover, which lasts. Smells of caramel, bit of yeast and a touch of earthiness. Flavor begins with a big dose of caramel, baked brown bread, and then some bittering hops. A touch of hops flavor on the finish (they use hops pellets here). Body is actually respectable, much better than I expected. Above average extraction, sweet caramel and lightly crisp yeast on the end. Nothing complex, though. The carbonation is a bit high and goes from peppery to flat by the end of the glass. A little thin after it has warmed, on the end. For an American Dark, this is quite good, I thought.
Mohegan Sun Matahga Lager;Uncasville, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Race Book Brewpub at Mohegan Sun;Really not bad at all, for what it is.

Flavor starts with light caramel sweetness, followed by some graininess, and some more spicy hops, and a mild bitterness.

Mountain Sun Colorado Kind Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Tried the first time back in 2010 on a trip through Boulder. Has a hoppiness that affects every part of the mouth equally and gradually tapers off into a mellow alcoholic glow.
Mountain Sun Colorado Kind Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;On tap at Vine Street Pub. Clear, light amber appearance with a lacy beige head. Aroma of toasted malts, light caramel/toffee, grains and hops (pine, resin, flowers).

Mountain Sun Colorado Kind Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Pint at Vine Street. This is a hazy red with a permanent white head. Aroma is of raisins, toffee, toasted brown sugar and grapefruit and pine for a departure from the style. Palate is medium with some sticky residual sugars. A little metallic bite I find commonplace in ESBs is present along with rich, sweet malt flavors of toffee, brown sugar, dried figs and an assertive citrus/pine hop bite for balance. This isn’t my preferred style, but I can hang with this one.
Mountain Sun Colorado Kind Ale;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Mountain Sun Pub & Brewery;Tap @ Mtn. Sun. Clear orangey golden with creamy head and good lacing.

Stichtse Heeren Blond;Utrecht, Netherlands;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brouwerij de Stichtse Heren;A dark orange beer with no head, though the bottle was very lively when we opened it. The aroma is sweet with notes of cloves and caramel. The flavor also contains notes of cloves and the hops prickles the tongue. A somewhat boring beer - or maybe my expectation just were higher.
Stichtse Heeren Blond;Utrecht, Netherlands;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brouwerij de Stichtse Heren;Bottled feb 2002. Light amber color, with chunks of yeast. Nice hoppy pear and caramelaroma.

Stichtse Heeren Tripel;Utrecht, Netherlands;Tripel;Brouwerij de Stichtse Heren;Bottle conditioned. Gold colour, moderate white head, moderate condition. Initial honey notes followed by spicy corriander, almost witbier like. Strange wiff of ammonia as it warms. Sweet honey and malt , thick and full bodied mouth feel. Interesting aftertaste with corriander returning, some malt, coconut and a lingering almond/marzipan amaretto liqueur hint.
Stichtse Heeren Tripel;Utrecht, Netherlands;Tripel;Brouwerij de Stichtse Heren;Indeed, cloudy orange colour. Smell is a little sweet. Taste then is sweet to, bit spicy, fruity, perhaps I now know how ''corriander tasts.. I must say I liked this one. But it''s kinda sweet for a triple. Definately not ''just an ordinary average triple''.
Stichtse Heeren Tripel;Utrecht, Netherlands;Tripel;Brouwerij de Stichtse Heren;certainly heavy on the coriander. not much else to distinguish it from other (better) trippels. moonhead. some orange tang, sweet and heavy

Amstel Bright;Willemstad, Curaçao;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);Country Tick #96: Golden beer, small head, aroma skunk, lightstruck, malt, grain, taste same, sweet, meh.
Amstel Bright;Willemstad, Curaçao;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);Sampled from 0.275 l bottle from 'Speciaalbierpakket.nl', best before May 2020. Clear, pale golden with a thin, frothy, almost stable, white head. Sweetish, a little grassy aroma of grains and hints of straw. Moderately sweet, slightly bitter, a bit grassy taste of grains and a touch of straw, followed by a short, slightly bitter, a bit grassy and minimally metallic finish. Thin to medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Boring but drinkable.
Amstel Bright;Willemstad, Curaçao;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);"Signature beer of Curacao, great on the beach in the sun. Lucky enough to have been ""stationed"" in Carakas bay where the beach bar would tell us to lock up when we finished drinking. Anecdotally the only beer made from salt water, as the brewery desalinates its water for brewing."

Amstel Bright;Willemstad, Curaçao;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);Pours clear, very light golden with a full, white head that rapidly dissipates. Aroma is corn and skunk. Taste is light corn syrup - pure sugar, but not cloying, moving to a hint of hops. Finish is non-existent. A pale lager, indeed.
Amstel Bright;Willemstad, Curaçao;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);Summerbeer from amstel. Aroma is light. Taste is a very light bitter and makes this an easy to drink beer and easy to forgot.
Amstel Bright;Willemstad, Curaçao;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);Ziet er erg zomers uit in een transparant flesje, smaakt zoet moutig met een tikkeltje citrus. Smaakloze doorzuiper
Amstel Bright;Willemstad, Curaçao;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);27,5cl bottle at home, bought at Slijterij Groningen, Vismarkt. Had many of these during a holiday in Curaçao some years ago, but never rated it since these bottles are generally served with lime wedges. So this is the first time without the lime wedge. Appearance: clear light straw with medium, white head that dissipates rather quickly. Aroma: Immediately after opening the bottle a whiff of what seems to be a combination of horse stable and skunky cannabis comes to the nose. After pouring the aroma becomes just pale malts, cornbread, cardboard and some metal, with an occasional hint of that horse-weed which source is still unknown to me.Taste: medium sweetness and medium bitterness. Notes of light malts, some grains and cornbread. Palate: light bodied, watery texture and moderate, lively carbonation. I expected the taste to be way worse, since it apparently needs lime to gain flavor, but it actually is drinkable without lime.
Amstel Bright;Willemstad, Curaçao;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);Bottle 0,275ltr: Very clear golden colored brew with an very weak bitter taste, with annoying hints of sweet corn. But i think this is an Curaçao-tick and if so an another country-tick.
Hitachino Nest Weizen;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);$4.99 bottle, World Market. Hazy gold with a soft white head. Aroma is wheat, floral hops - somewhat perfumey, light banana. Flavor is wheat, yeast, banana, floral hops, light fruit. Decent.
Hitachino Nest Weizen;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Аромат весьма пряный, много специй как у витбира, ощущаются дрожжи. По всей видимости в пиве много белка так как пенка отличная, хотя цвет средний. Вкус странный для пшенички. Похоже на водянистый бельгийский блонд и витбир. Много специй, дрожей, сама пшеничка хорошо ощущается. Послевкусие с легкой хмелевой горчинкой и кислинкой при глотке. Немного алкоголя, когда пиво постоит. В целом нормас.
Hitachino Nest Weizen;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);"Appearance: cloudy amber; half inch head Taste: similar to Ebel Weiss 6/29/18 - Swordfish (Batavia, IL) $5 ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Hitachino Nest Weizen;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Bottle from Total Wine in Palo Alto, CA. Aroma is cloves, floral (maybe orange blossom), some vanilla. Taste is crisp and herbal (almost Pilsner-esque) with a mild tart citrus quality and then a dry spice / clove finish. Crisp and refreshing but maybe a bit underwhelming.
Hitachino Nest Weizen;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy gold with an instantly gone fizzy head. Sour yeasty weizen tastes. Suspended yeast sits in the mild carbonation. Very filling for a wheat beer. I like some of their others more.
Hitachino Nest Weizen;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Nice smooth wheat beer. Orangey bitterness compliments it well too. Quite clean and easy drinking able, not massively wheatey or thick.

Hitachino Nest Weizen;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);A bottle from Jason's near NCCU, drunk at home. Aroma: smells rather sour. Appearance: hazy, light amber, minimal lacing. Palate: medium-bodied and slick, average carbonation, abrupt astringent finish. Taste: lightly sweet, but something metallic lingers to spoil it. Not a wheat beer as I know, could it be a bad bottle?
Hitachino Nest Weizen;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Starts out light and pilsner-ish, then quickly develops clove and vanilla notes, all fine and dandy for a hefeweizen. But a thick, honey-tinged heaviness overtakes the middle, growing cloy and musty towards the back end. Finishes with a clingy sweetness mixed with off-putting fruit esters. Decent pour, super-sweet nose, and a good feel, but the sweetness is really hard to bear.
Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);2/3 in cuckfield. Not my style I regret. A bit too sour. Bitter. Sherbet. Not great. Not good looking either - started with a big head, ended with zero. Haven’t tried it on the wife though so perhaps has other properties.
Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Best beach beer ever!

Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);"330ml bottle brewed in Japan at 5.5%. Manageable so-so lasting head, fairly large bubbles. Aroma a bit like liquid detergent but a lot less perfumed, noticeable wheat and especially orange notes when compared to other witbier. Dull lemon yellow, very hazy with yeast strings in suspension. Moderate carbonation. Slightly orange-y mild hops, orange peel and orange juice come together to make a gentle chord of orange notes on the palate. Nutmeg is noticeable and lovely, working similarly with the coriander to deliver low spicy notes. The wheat is there doing work, but mostly in the background, whereas the barley malt lives up to the ""white ale"" name and has some body, not like the more lager-y malt found in some other witbiers. Tangy and smooth, a lot of flavours here, yet smoothly sequenced in a delicious flow, all the while individually discernible. This is very high-craft brewing. Distinctive yet quintessentially a witbier, and strongly recommended."
Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Small head and disappear fast. Full in the mouth. Mild to minimum bitter, light but a little bit of sour at the back. No much aroma. Easy to drink.
Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Orange with a fleeting, foamy head. Citrus aroma with a hint of spice.

Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Fast disappearing head, mild fragrance, light body and minimal flavor. Not the best lager but very light and easy on the stomach.
Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Not on vid, but based on checklist. Smell- weak, citrus, yeast maybe. Foam- thin, large in mouth, weak bitter-sweet notes with citrus and yeast. Head is small even, disappears fast, white color. Appearance- Unique brewery bottle cap. clear yellow, with some active carbonation and some bubbles on sides. Taste- yeast, citrus, weak bitter-sweetness, acidic tones, some caramel somewhere. Generally feels unimpressive somehow. still drinkable.
Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Decent witbier. A nice balance of coriander, banana and yeast. Very smooth.
Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Sorry, but this is the worst craft beer of all times. Pours hazy orange, white head which disappeared in few seconds. Aroma of honey and diabetes. Tastes sweet. Sweet and sweet. Honey sugar diabetes... Nothing else. Sugary water. I wish I can give a 0 score!
Hitachino Nest White Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);"Clear gold with poor foam retention and no lacing; medium carbonation. Aroma is orange zest with spices (a lot of nutmeg with a hint of coriander), and banana bread malt smell. The taste is pretty over powering nutmeg with some malty orange. Over all, a carbonated mouthfeel and a light to medium body."

Fairly bland and innocuous beer, at least at first. Sweet bready malts and grains dominate, though I definitely get some buttered bread coming though. Kind of doughy and raw, too. Mild hop profile. Though there is definitely some grassy hop flavor and bitterness.

Orion Pils;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Yes, it’s good with sushi. It’s pasteurized, but many times more everything than Budweiser. More hops, more mouthfeel, more aroma. I’m an ale guy, but this was enjoyable.
Orion Pils;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);I feel the need to defend this beer. Orion beer is only good in Okinawa, served with fresh sushi. The Orion bottles I have had in the U.S. taste as though they have been heated and cooled a few times. On Okinawa, the brewery is no further than 2 1/2 hours away from every izakaya pub and restaurant. When it is fresh and cold it is an enjoyable beer for the unbearable Okinawan heat! Kampai!
Orion Dry;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Much like it's cousin...asahi dry...not a bad mass produced beer..I would try what ever seasonal beer is out at the time as they are always much better.

Morro Bay Dads Pale Ale;Morro Bay, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Morro Bay Brewing Company;Very nice orange-gold color, fruity malt & cascade hops aroma.

Grizzly Peak Cask ESB;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;On cask at the brewpub. No aroma. Hard to drawn anything other than faint brown sugar. Pours a clear brown, with rocky off-white head above. Flavor is a sweet and woody. A light tooth of crispness in sugar and old hop bitterness.

Stoudts Winter Ale (-2008);Adamstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Stoudts Brewing Co.;"Wasn’t sure what this beer was supposed to be as I drank it. It seemed too thin to be a porter, not hoppy or malty enough to be a brown ale, and no spices meant no Winter warming. Now I learn it’s a porter; not good. Bland and lifeless, the only signs of this beer truly being a porter are on the nose, giving off a modest roasty mocha vibe, but the flavors never materialize as you sip the pint. (12/7/08)"

Vermont Pub Rocktoberfest;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance had a sharp burnt red color with a nice little white head. Quickly dies. No lacing. The aroma starts with a grassy/grainy hop bitterness and then some ruddy crisp sweet toffee to caramel malts. The flavor seems to lean sweet with a sly composure of the hops showing a little bit of sweet. Quick malty sweet aftertaste with a sly grassy bitter hopped finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Pure smooth sweet malts move nicely on my tongue.

Overall : Fairly uneventful and not exciting. Nothing really bad per say but not worth the caloric intake.
Vermont Pub Rocktoberfest;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"My Bottom Line : Toasted malts collapse into a flour-y finish while leafy hops and fruity edges (berries) contribute some depth. Further Personal Perceptions : -A ring of foam circles the dark auburn. -Where is the crispness? This doesn’t feel like a lager much... -The finish is relatively empty; some raw dough and feeble hop bitterness. -The fruitiness is puzzling for such a lager. On tap at the brewpub."

Vermont Pub Silk Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - English;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Slightly cloudy golden body topped by a long lasting medium off-white head leaving good lacing. The beer looks good, the reasonably malted body feels ok, the carbonation is pleasant but man, the beer tastes almost nothing. No aroma to speak of. Faint caramel and faint roastiness. Absolutely inexpressive hops. Flavourless mild bitterness. Not offensive, just deprived of flavour. Feels cheap. Cotton Ale.

Vermont Pub Silk Ale;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - English;Vermont Pub & Brewery;My Bottom Line: The shy balance of citrusy hops and pale maltiness in this pale ale makes for an easy-drinking experience, but its excessive simplicity does get tiresome. Further Personal Perceptions: -A screen of foam covers the hazy caramel amber. -The finish is dry, and facilitates the subsequent sip. -Carbation is smooth, helping the mouthfeel. -The cereal sweetness is pleasant, but doesn’t offer much complexity.

Wild Onion Pumpkin Ale;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Wild Onion Brewery;DATE: October 14, 2018... OCCASION: Sunday evening as fall has indeed fallen--time for a grunt of pumpkin, and my first from Wild Onion.... sizzles and fizzes out the bottle, with a half-finger of creamy, off-white head sitting confidently atop a light brown/amber body with thin bubbles that populate the glass... presents as a malty, bready prominence, with the pumpkin lightly suggested but by no means the worth the label on its can... light spices hint at allspice or nutmeg, or a bit of cinnamon--not much to write about... a base brown body, medium-bodied and hearty for the season, but with a slight buttery feel at the tongue... its aftertaste holds reasonably... cinnamon, yam, sweet potato, butter, sweet sugars, apple, and hints of bread dough make this a warming, yet moderate experience.... easy-drinking and rewarding to a point, with enough spiciness to make it a stand-alone nightcap...

Wild Onion Pumpkin Ale;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Wild Onion Brewery;Slight fruit and pumpkin aroma. Taste is light and pumpkin sweetness. Poured from 12pz can at home. Enjoyable pumpkin but have had better
Wild Onion Pumpkin Ale;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Wild Onion Brewery;Wild Onion Brewing’s Pumpkin Ale (5.4%) is the last of the pumpkin beers I picked up in Chicago. It pours deep copper gold with a decent head. A slightly spicy cinnamon with that apple pie aroma I got from many mid-West pumpkin ales. Medium to light bodied with a scratchy carbonation. The taste gives me cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a sweet fruitiness. I think the sweetness and spicing is a bit overdone and needs a gentler touch for my tastes.
Fuller's Vintage Ale 1998;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);550ml bottle - thanks Anna! (8:5:8:5:17=4.3) Bottle #40593 20 years - blimey! Deep amber, some haze, beautiful self-supporting spongy head - looks great for ever! Lovely rich fruity aroma, clearly wonderfully aged and autolysed - raisins, some dates, but some lovely orangy spiciness too. Beautifully mellow palate, sweetishly smooth, and some very gentle carbonation, so velvetty and succulent. Beautiful in the mouth - rich and mellow malts, gently woody tannins, raisins, and ending with lovely sweet pressed dates. Dryish tannins take over from the dates for a long dusty finish. An absolutely magnificent strong English ale, and quite how Anna managed to snarf a bottle 20 years on, I really can't guess. Makes me wish I had bought more of the more recent vintages, so I can stretch some of them out to this kind of distance. To any middle-men that may have aided the acquisition - thanks too.

Poachers Dick;Lincoln, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Poachers Brewery;Bottle Conditioned. Orange brown colour with an effervescent head.

Molson Dry 6.5 (formerly Hi Dry);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is what some of my friends drank in high school to get wasted, also Molson XXX. It was a deep gold pour but pretty rough & boozy. No one drank it for the taste.
Molson Dry 6.5 (formerly Hi Dry);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Couleur doré assez intense, mousse savonneuse qui demeure plus longtemps que prévu. On sent le houblon, mais aussi le sucré de l’alcool. Les saveurs ressenties en bouche dès la première seconde sont toujours là à la dixième : alcool et maïs. Très éructante. Artificiellement chaude et réconfortante, la Molson Dry 6.5 est un affreux mutant de la blonde canadienne de base ; c’est donc un breuvage sans goût, destiné au large public, avec de l’alcool en prime, ce qui diminue le ratio coût versus effets éthyliques. C’est sa seule (et peu glorieuse) réussite."

Molson Dry 6.5 (formerly Hi Dry);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated December 2005 when it was called Hi Dry. Pours a medium golden colour with good lively carbonation. White head is big and foamy with tiny bubbles. Aromas of malt liquor, malty and alcohol. Semi-sweet malt start with a dry finish. Kind of unpleasant at first with a strong corn taste and alcohol, but as the brew breathes, becomes quite smooth. Even apples appear in the aftertaste. A nice decent light malt liquor.
Molson Dry 6.5 (formerly Hi Dry);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Further in the Molson Dry series is 6.5%, one up from the regular five-point-five and far less than the sugary rice-wine mess that is their ten-point-one beast. Why do I rate these things? Well, why not? Perhaps it’s a sense of morbid fascination, that by tasting all of the Molson Dry series from weakest to strongest I learn more about the brewing process, how they arbitrarily add alcoholic content, how getting utterly wasted from a ten percent monster might not be the best idea compared to simply sipping on a six-point-five brew such as this. Or, perhaps it is my fascination with gutter beers, which seem to be so prevalent across the North American continent. Then again, there are plenty of gutter beers in Europe as well, but they don’t come in 1.18litre bottles - and perhaps that is the difference. So, opening up this behemoth of a bottle I pour it into my Cantillon glass. The head is large and white, the body is gold with a modest level of carbonation. The aroma is faint, it’s of corn and grain alcohol but nothing overpowering. The taste is bad corn and rice adjuncts mixed together with a sickly sweet finish. This stuff is poorly made and doesn’t do the job right anyways; if I want to get drunk, I’ll go for the 10.1% bottle, or better yet, just buy some damned vodka already!"
Molson Dry 6.5 (formerly Hi Dry);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Big ass 1.18 litre jug style bottle. This one was just called Hi Dry, not dry 6.5. Man, Gatineau is awash in jugs of beer like this. Every gas station and variety store you go in has a nice selection of jugs of malt liquors. Pale yellow body pours a frothy, short lived white head. Nose is vegetal and quite grainy and hints mostly at corn and hay. Not as offensive a flavour as I suspected. Like stale pale malts with corn and white bread. Pretty bland with a bit of a booze kick towards the finish. Better than some of the other gems I got from the same shop.
Molson Dry 6.5 (formerly Hi Dry);Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Pilsener - Imperial;Molson Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle as Molson Hi Dry. Golden colour with off white head. Aroma of malty grass and wet towels. Flavour is very complimenting of the aroma. Light watery palate. Lots of carbonation.

Pours clear yellow, head quickly declines to nothing. Very similar to Molson Canadian, with the slightly increased taste of alcohol and the drier finish. Nothing special to seek out, but for $2 CAN flat, you can’t beat almost a liter of quaffable brew.

Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Worst.name.ever. That a beer was once made in a warehouse in which I once worked and was not only tied to the brewery which shale not be named, but also a person I knew brings me a brief moment of shame. There, I’m over it. The beer is now long gone as it should be. Strange flavors? No kidding - I saw the equipment, and knew that the funk often hid far worse.
Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Not good, not bad. It just sits there and stares at you like a lost puppy, waiting for you to call its name. A very unspectacular beer. Out of business for a reason: It sucks. Terrible. Horrible. This brewer should be castrated NOW.
Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;I believe my beer was slightly skunked, but I failed to see where this could be any good without the skunk. My beer had way too much carbonation, one good shake when the bottle was halfway full made it overflow with foam. Otherwise, it was similar to shiner but with perhaps a little more body/depth to the taste. I speculate that a fresh bottle would do wonders for my perception of this beer.
Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Pours a nice dark brown, with a little golden highlights. Aroma is a little toastiness and coffee, maybe a little cherry, too. Definitely a bit sweet smelling, but taste is very bland. Better than Shiner, but that doesn't say much.
Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Initial smell was slightly malty with discernable nutty and caramel aromas. Poured a brownish ambur color and developed just a small trace of a head. Flavor was reasonable well balanced with nothing standing out too much. Some caramel, malt, hop flavors but nothing too pronounced. Better than other Texas bocks.

Nice maltiness plainly apparent but with a boatload of strange flavor combinations--nuts (hazlenuts), chocolate, caramel, woodiness, and I had only a hint of the sourness experienced by others. Another in the pantheon of very average (and below average) Texas beers.
Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Bottle. Dark ruby color with a tan head. Nice toasted malt aroma and flavor. I was delighted with this beer for what it tried to be.
Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;WAY better than the other Balcones Fault beers, but it still has the unexpected sourness that is a characteristic of the others. Dark appearance, small head. Only faint hints of bitter-sour-chocolate, very strange for something calling itself a bock. A little caramel, medium-bodied.
Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;Sour almost like a frickin'' lambic. What''s up with this Balcones Brewery?! Every recipe they come up with tastes like a Doc''s Hard Lemonade! I realize they''re brewing this to compete with Texas''s best-selling Shiner Bock but they definitely could''ve done a much better job. Either my bottle''s bad (in which case I fault the brewery) or the beer''s fairly sour (in which case I fault the brewery).
Balcones Fault Bats Breath Bock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Great Grains Brewery, Inc.;I like to see Texas breweries attempt to make a beer like this...it gives me hope. Very little head...cloudy hazy brownish-red color. Sweet malty aroma with hints of pecan. Went down almost too smotth, I got more taste in the finish than anything. Tasted of sweet malts...molasses...crisp...not bad but fell way short of being a great beer.

Smak: przede wszystkim złożony ze słodkiej podbudowy, chmiel prawie w ogóle nie wyczuwalny, a zatem goryczki się raczej nie uświadczy, nie ma uczucia mdłego, ale to co jest takie sobie. W zapachu alkoholu nie czuć, spożycie jednak ujawnia jego sporą zawartość. Być może taka warka, ale na mnie wrażenia nie zrobiło to piwo prawie żadnego.

This poured a clear cola brown with a large, healthy, dark tan head. Rocky retention and suddy lace. Sweet coffee nose with milk chocolate. Taste is salty, small metallic, mild raisin and plum. Not bad at all. As it warms, taste gains too much blood iron. Not my favorite, but a big step up from most Peruvians beers and by far the best dark beer in Peru. Granted, the only other one I found was Cusquena Malta (Negra), which is quite poor."

Sweet malt dominates the nose, as always fresh, crisp and clean with the start malt and mild in its sweetness, top fair to middling in feel to the palate. Finish has a crisp acidity and the hops as expected, mild and pleasing, quite dry and a drinkable beer, with the aftertaste dry and lingering.

Schmucker Rosé Bock;Mossautal, Hesse, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Privat-Brauerei Schmucker (Brau Holding Intl. - Heineken);Die Optik ist wirklich herausragend. Kastanienfarben bis rötlich mit cremigem, sehr stabilem Schaum - das Schmucker Rosé Bock sieht wirklich mega appetitlich aus. Die 8,0% riecht man nicht unbedingt, aber spätestens im Antrunk ist der Alkohol deutlich spürbar - und trotzdem nie aufdringlich. Vollmundiger Körper, der lange und kräftig nachvibriert. Insgesamt finde ich das Schmucker sehr harmonisch, angenehm süffig und mit dem entsprechenden Wumms für die dunkle Jahreszeit. Kategorie: absolut gelungen!

De la Soif Barbe Torte Ambrée Au Blé Noir;Nantes, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;De la Soif;33cl bottle @ Niamey Craft beer tasting, merci Ludo. I guess brewed for Lidl. No BB. Ambrée, col beige. Arôme au nez axé sur le grains avec un nez se rapprochant de l'encens le tout laissant penser à un vieux couloir d'abbaye. Pas vraiment de marque des houblons. Palais est malté caramel avec une petite note de toffee. Le côté sarrasin donne une signature assez distincte au niveau des grains. Le houblonné reste, quant à lui, marqué par des notes nobles allant sur le léger citronné/terreux.

De la Soif Barbe Torte Ambrée Au Blé Noir;Nantes, France;Bière de Garde / de Mars;De la Soif;Belle robe rousse avec une mousse ivoire généreuse qui retombe vite. Le nez dégage une odeur de sucre de plus en plus intense au fur et à mesure de la dégustation avec une amertume qui lui est associée.L’ensemble nous laisse avec un arrière goût désagréable(levure). Manque de caractère pour une ambrée avec une sensation trop forte d’eau sucrée et amère! La Barbe Torte blonde surpasse sa petite soeur!

Sweet caramelly toffee aroma, still dominated by zwickelly hops and grassy notes with some lemon, good complex aroma indeed. Medium bodied, soft palated.

Koff Weizze;Kerava, Finland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Bottle.* [ Vintage BBF 10-2001 ]. Clear light to medium yellow colour with virtually no head. Aroma is light to moderate malty, wheat, pale malt, light to moderate yeasty, yeast, apple - apple skin, vintage. Flavour is moderate sweet with a long duration, fruity, yeasty, vintage, cardboard. Body is medium, texture is watery, carbonation is flat to soft. [20130424]
Koff Weizze;Kerava, Finland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);"Bottled (BBE 10/2001). Yellowish golden colour with small white foamy head and some particles floating around. The particles are probably some strange things due to the age of the beer. Aroma is bready, grainy and surprisingly citrusy and wheatlike. Flavour is wheat, some interesting sweet grainyness as well as some mild fruityness as well. The sweet grainyness leaves me thinking what that actually is, but it could also be something due to age. Interestingsly enough, this beer has held as well. Not a wit nor a Weizze, but probably one of the first wheat lagers in Finland (this wheat lager thing was a hit in Finland some 3-4 years ago, when one summer we suddently had a few of those, though this beer was ahead of it’s times). Some of these ""Theme Koff"" beers actually have been very nice (of those around when I began rating I remember Kaura and a few others, which then we’re taken off market at some point). Those were still tasty, so even macros can do good stuff every now and then."
Koff Weizze;Kerava, Finland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Bottle, somewhere around 2003. Can’t really call this a witbier, as the taste seemed watered-down compared to the true renditions. The flavor was bizarre, bringing to mind Finnish Camping Lenkki processed meat sausages.
Koff Weizze;Kerava, Finland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);330ml bottle. Too sticky to be a Wit, an insult to the style. Filtered, which removes any interesting character that the ingredients might have had. Disinctively wheat-based, with some coriander, but in general quite disappointing.
Koff Weizze;Kerava, Finland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Refreshing summer beer. No substitute for the German ones, though. Unfortunately there are no Finnish wheat beers available at the moment, at least from the larger breweries.
Koff Weizze;Kerava, Finland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);Pale golden, crystal clear. Somewhat sweetish, clean, aroma of citrus and coriander.
Koff Weizze;Kerava, Finland;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);I don't know if this is a filtered version of the departed Kruunu or not, but it is very much like a witbier, with a light palate, and some citrus accent. Not as good, and especially not as complex, as Kruunu was.
Koff Velvet;Kerava, Finland;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Sinebrychoff (Carlsberg);33 cl bottle @ home. Rated on 26.06.2010 Aroma is somewhat malty with toffee, some syrup and roasted notes.

Apollo Lager;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minnesota Brewing Company;The blue bottle attracted me as well. Not much good to say about this one, the bottle is better than the beer
Apollo Lager;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minnesota Brewing Company;We bought 6 bottles op this beer with our astronomy club. The only thing i remember was the blue bottle and that the beer was bad.
Apollo Lager;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minnesota Brewing Company;I remember this and the blue bottle - I gave in to the marketing ploy (I actually thought it might be good). Rancid actually. Is it really aged on oak for a long time? That might work on a hoppy ale...not with this light offering.
Apollo Lager;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minnesota Brewing Company;Foul aroma, foul taste. Makes the top 10 list of worst beers ever. What is it with blue bottle beers and horrid, repulsive taste? The aftertaste of this beer lingered and plagued my mouth for some time. Too bad I bought an entire 6-pack. I have never seen this beer since I purchased it 5 years ago...probably for a reason.
Rogue Incinerator;Newport, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rogue Ales;Bottle at Dr. Bill’s. Dark brown. Flat-looking, which makes sense given its age. Deep fruit aroma and lots of malt.

Rogue Incinerator;Newport, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rogue Ales;2000, Draft Extremely hazy brick red beneath a fizzy light layer of foam. Huge aroma mostly dominated by figs and smoked malt. Bready undertones, alongside licorice, grape, oxidation, and coconut. Sits thin and powdery on the palate. Heavily smoked malt flavors, followed by plum and bread notes. Finishes very long with perpetual smoke and bread. Interesting concept here, but somehwat of a let down due to the slight traces of oxidation.
Rogue Incinerator;Newport, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rogue Ales;I am not a big fan of smoked beers and was expecting a smokeless doppelbock. This reminded me of Stone Smoked Porter when I first tasted it. A decent beer with a slight sweetness and bitterness to it. On tap at Rich O''s, New Albany, Indiana.
Rogue Incinerator;Newport, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rogue Ales;An interseting take on a dopple-bock. The smokiness of the XS-smoke is fairly well hidden in the sweetness of the Old Crusty. This is a good thing considering how upfront those flavors are in the original.

Holgate Brewhouse Mt Macedon Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Holgate Brewhouse;Bottle. Pours clear golden. Floral, citrus, biscuit. Medium light body. Very highly carbonated.
Holgate Brewhouse Mt Macedon Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Holgate Brewhouse;330 ml bottle at The Great Beer Bar. Bottle says best before 31 May 2919, so take this review with a pinch of salt! Appearance is a dull, opaque, hazy gold, with a big fluffy head of persistent white froth. It feels pretty overcarbonated too. Aroma is interesting - pomeloes, which I don't think is found in Australia, so the combo of citrus hops must have produced it. Taste is sweet, tropical fruity, and some grainy malt. Light bodied, very fizzy.
Holgate Brewhouse Mt Macedon Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Holgate Brewhouse;Unpretentious but complex and a a great finish. A good example of what this brewery can do.

Smooth, slightly dry, light, crisp, clean, refreshing with moderate bitterness on a short finish.
Holgate Brewhouse Mt Macedon Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Holgate Brewhouse;Hazy golden with generous fluffy head. Aroma is a little piney, lots of citrus with maybe even some mango. Quite a clean bitter taste, not as hop driven as aroma led me to believe, not all that ’pale’. Biscuit malt tastes too. Very pleasant and refreshing, can’t imagine it would offend anyone. Easy drinking.
Holgate Brewhouse Mt Macedon Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Holgate Brewhouse;Grassy fruity aroma and deep gold colour. Crisp, light, bubbly and clean feel. Light hops and bitterness balance. Subtle sweetness. Quite reasonable.

Holgate Brewhouse Mt Macedon Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Holgate Brewhouse;Restrained grassy aroma in a golden pour. Hop malt balance is laid back and perfect for the style. As is the crisp clean finish. A very tasty brew in the end.
Holgate Brewhouse Mt Macedon Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;Holgate Brewhouse;(Bottle) Pours hazy golden amber with small loose white head. Pleasant aroma - citrus, pine, hints of grass, biscuits and cardboard. Light body with rather fizzy carbonation. Taste is light on malt and heavy on hops giving some imbalance. Starts with tart citrus notes with the slightest biscuity malt, becomes a little watery in the mid-palate and then some good hoppy bitterness develops in the finish. Pleasant enough but rather unbalanced. Seems to have had a name change to Mt. Macedon Pale Ale.

There seemed to a race between the two beers; which would lose it's head first! Anyway this had a slight malty front in both the aroma and taste, body didn't have much depth and came across as a bit 'watery'. Looked better than it was to be honest. Visited the brewery two days later and it wasn't much better there either!"

Bürger Classic;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Sampled from a 12 oz can this beer poured a yellow gold color with a large foamy white head that left decent lacing. The aroma was tangy, yeasty and a bit fruity. The flavor was tangy and a bit grainy with sour mash, a bit yeast and a hint of hops. Medium length finish. Medium body. Better than usual for this style but still not good.
Bürger Classic;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;As far as pale lagers go this is pretty good. Probably would’ve tasted better in the summer. Aroma was close to nothing. Sweet caramel was distant but detectable. Pour was a clear light gold with no head and a few rising bubbles. Taste was sweet and caramelly and a little thick. Beats the hell out of any macro swill as far as flavor goes. Finish was quick and a little sweet with lingering sweetness. No hops to balance anything out. Mild carbonation. I have to admit I thought this was Bitburger until I really read the label

Bürger Light;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Been waiting for a while to try this and I finally scored a $10 case of 24 at Pete's Uptown in Ellwood City, decent beer distributor. The place is run by a couple of freindly gentlemanlike hippies, heheh. How about this, a good drinken cheap unoffensive american beer for less than 46 cents a can! ! Smell is clean and fresh and non-offensive. My palate says it a very good civilized cheap pale lager, I'm enjoying this. Friendly and bubbly, what else can you ask for in beer? A big numbing alky content? NO? Just asking. That's what you may want. This is simply a real nice 1960's contemporary beer drinking experience, you know, before the popularity of the recent faddish IPA wave? This is almost as good as Straub American, Ringside or even Burgh'ers 1890, almost rises to the top, thanks Burgher!

Bürger Light;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;Smells like typical macro swill. Corn, faint hops, crisp, easy drinking. Corn not so much in flavor, more malts.
Bürger Light;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co.;12oz can into a pint glass. Pours a clear straw yellow with a one finger white head. Surprisingly good head retention for this style of beer but the lacing is a bit lacking. Aroma is very metallic with notes of corn and cooked vegetables. A tiny bit of spicy hops is detectable in the background. Creamed corn flavor with more vegetable. A touch of bread and hay along with a brief whiff of wet grass. Light bitterness with a slightly sweet finish. Mouthfeel is a bit chalky. Overall, this is a budget beer and it shows but in saying that, it is not bad for what it is. I would take this over the big 3 any day.

Clear yellow color. Little off-white head. Some loose bits of lace. Fine, stringy particles in the body, looks like dust. Stronger, pronounced, kind of rough carbonation. More dry finish. Very light flavor, but what’s there is not good. Corn, metallic, macro-type flavor. Mild sweet, moderate bitter taste, with a lingering bite. Light acidic. Can looks almost identical to a Busch Light. Sub par"

Leopard Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Pale golden pour with slight white head the does not hang around.

Leopard Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A fairly good pub lager considering the alternatives that used to be on tap here in NZ. Still nothing incredibly special overall though.
Leopard Lager;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I pretty much agree with beer_ledgend on this one. That head certainly dissipates in an awful hurry. Affordable and basically tastes better and therefore is much more easily drunk than many of the local alternatives. Also, the 440 ml. slightly larger than average can is a bit of a plus.

Appearance: Pale color, cloudy (big yeast particles, seems like Wädi Bräu might use bottom fermenting yeasts in the bottle). Minimal white head (less than 0.5 figners). Aroma: Hint of bubble gum, light sweetness, no hop aroma, no banana. Taste: Bubble gum, light, dry, no hops, no bitterness detectable, no sweetness. Palate: Light-medium body, lively carbonation. Dry finish. Overall: The last Ur-Weizen I had smelled like urine! I was so displeased that it took a while to try another Ur-Weizen again. And now, well it is better than last time... Still, I am not convinced about this beer. It is ok this time, no flaws! But I would not order a second one.

Abbaye des Rocs La Montagnarde Altitude 6;Montignies-sur-Roc, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs;September 2016 - Bottle share at One Canada Square, London. As ’Abbaye des Rocs La Montagnarde Altitude 6’, 6%, BB 2004. Now this beer obviously wasn’t intended to be aged for around 14 years, so that needs to be taken into account. Pours a translucent dark yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma is buttery bread crusts, crackers, musty wheat grains. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is thin watery malts, buttery, corn. Drinkable enough at the age. Interesting to try, obviously better younger. (2.7)

Abbaye des Rocs La Montagnarde Altitude 6;Montignies-sur-Roc, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de l'Abbaye des Rocs;Bottle. Pours very unclear, almost muddy blonde, towards amber. OK white head. Smell is sweet, bit metallic even. Taste is mildly bitter. Bit maderization as well ( bought this last week, but it appears to be expired since june ... ) shows a number of ’aged’ factors, leading to make one think it would be older than it actually is. Rather blank, overall. No real distinguishing character here.

Wittekerke Speciale (Millennium);Harelbeke, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;De Brabandere;Thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is wheat with some lemons and toffee. Not quite what I expected from a witbier, but not too bad. The flavor is not as good and has some unexpected notes. I get the yeast, wheat and lemons like I expected, but I also get some vanilla and cough syrup notes. The beer is also lightly tart, but nothing like you would get from a sour or Berliner Weiss. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

Looks like a Energy Drink that they try to peddle to children. Tagline is ""Elle est trop Bonne"". Pours almost clear yellow with a very big white head. Settles as 1 cm thick layer of fluffy foam climbing up the sides of the glass. Massive lacing. Aroma is sweet, malty and boozy. Sweet malts and grains. Very light banana. Sour notes. Metallic alcohol. Strong carbonation. Slightly thick, oily, slick and lightly tingly texture. Flavor is rather sweet followed by moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetish with a sour tang. Notable alcoholic presence. Pretty clean and strong Belgian. But not especially interesting. But if you need a solid Mule Kick this might be for you."

Middle Ages Highlander 80/-;Syracuse, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Relatively clear looking light brown but with a dark, deep opaque cylinder of thickness in the middle part of the glass. Big heavy head with a light brown tinge. Looks stagnant -- in a good way. Lace sticks right to the glass. The smell is a pungent, alcohol heavy Scottish ale aroma. Thick malty scent of a porter, but with none of the usual coffee. Minor hosp. Roasted, thick malt aroma. Sweet caramel accent. The taste is thick, roasted Scottish malt. Some sweetness, like caramel. Has a tangy punch. The ringwood yeast is a terrific compliment and emerges more as it warms up. The burnt malt and sweet caramel candy are great together. Feels thick like motor oil. Very smooth. No fizzy bubbles that come with some Scottish ales. Leaves a sweet film on the tongue. It’s one of my favorite Scottish ales. Balanced and unusually smooth.
Middle Ages Highlander 80/-;Syracuse, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Cask conditioned at Mahars. Poured a dark brown with a bit of head. Aroma was sweet and tangy. Flavor was very potent for a cask beer, sweet and tangy like the aroma, with little hops.
Middle Ages Highlander 80/-;Syracuse, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;. Bit of smoke and roastiness. Faint flavours of fruit. Bitter aftertaste. Not for everyone, maybe for scotch drinkers to transition,
Middle Ages Highlander 80/-;Syracuse, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Growler. Aroma is malty, smokey and lots of caramel in there as well. Yummy. Color is a transparent mahogany with a small yellow/tan head. Carbonated caramelly, sweet and chewy. Smoke hints throughout. Might be a bit too carbonated for me, but this is a very good beed. I like it more than the Kilt Tilter.
Middle Ages Highlander 80/-;Syracuse, New York, United States;Scottish Ale;Middle Ages Brewing;Dark amber red brown color, tan head. Lots of caramelly malts in the aroma. Buttery flavor offset by a decent dose of hops. Medium to full body. Not bad at all.

Middle Ages The Duke Of Winship;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Middle Ages Brewing;12 ounce bottle shared at a tasting. Clear dark brown, thin fizzy tan head, good retention. Aroma of candy strawberries and toffee. The taste is dark fruit and caramel. Thin bodied.
Middle Ages The Duke Of Winship;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Middle Ages Brewing;12 oz. bottle. Pours almost exactly like a glass of Coca Cola, including the fizzy head, with lots of fat carbonation bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. Very pleasant aroma of coffee with some supporting chocolate and roast. The flavor is malt with some caramel sweetness and some roast. The roast de-evolves into more of a wet cardboard flavor. Thin bodied and overly carbonated. Prickly on the palate. While there are elements I like, overall I’m not a fan.
Middle Ages The Duke Of Winship;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Middle Ages Brewing;Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. The label has a very brief description of the beer but no abv%. Appearance: From a slow pour I got a very tall and thick foam head over a very dark brown liquid. Its clarity appears good though is very dark and hard to see through. As I sip on this beer the head holds on very well and makes a little slick lacing on the glass. Smell: The aroma is big and beautiful. It hit my nose right as I opened the bottle. It is full of malty and bready sweetness will notes off caramel, dark toast and faint earth hops in the distance. Taste / Palate: As the aroma suggested it has loads of malty sweetness flowing over the tongue. It is bready and toasty as well as sweet and candy like. I get all the dark toast and caramel notes from the nose plus a light roasted almond like nutty taste. It’s palate feels smooth, a little slick but it’s light enough to keep from being cloying.
Middle Ages The Duke Of Winship;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Middle Ages Brewing;Bottle shared by a friend. Clear chestnut brown pour with a thin beige head. Aroma of malt, roast and caramel with some nuts and chocolate. Malty and caramelly flavor with some roast and a bit of peat before a bitter, roasty finish.
Middle Ages The Duke Of Winship;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Middle Ages Brewing;Bottle. Smooth start and finish. Malty, roasted barley. Touch of chocolate. Thin mouthful, simple. Eady to drink porter. Ok at best.

Middle Ages The Duke Of Winship;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Middle Ages Brewing;Poured into a pint glass. 3.5 A: Clear deep amber color. One and a half fingers of frothy tan head. Retention is about average and a short ring of lacing is left. 3.5 S: Roasty and grainy with a pleasant caramel sweetness. Perhaps a touch of chocolate. Simple, but quite enjoyable. 3.5 T: The label claims that this is a Scotch ale/porter hybrid and that’s about right. While the nose smelled like a straight up porter, the taste has aspects of both. Roasty and grainy with a peaty earthiness. Good bit of caramel, but not a whole lot of sweetness. Decent enough flavors and plenty of power to make this a tasty brew. 3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Not very creamy, but there is some weight to this and it’s almost as good. 3.5 D: Easy drinking, but nothing special. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 08-01-2012 04:38:33
Middle Ages The Duke Of Winship;Syracuse, New York, United States;Porter;Middle Ages Brewing;7/8/12. 12oz bottle thanks to Robert! Nice brown pour with reds on the edges under a thick khaki head.

Taste is a complex bittersweet mix of smoky roasted malts, sweet dark fruits, pepper, brown sugar, strong espresso and bitter cocoa. Medium/light body and high carbonation, but a very pleasant mouthfeel. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Roasted malt, a bit of coffee, and a bit of sweet stone fruit in the nose.

Middle Ages Dragonslayer Imperial Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Middle Ages Brewing;This northeastern stout was absolutely delicious.

Middle Ages Dragonslayer Imperial Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Middle Ages Brewing;06-Mar-14 (22-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with shadey, thanks Shane!) Several years old, this beer is still quite solid. It pours a black body with half an inch of dark-tan head that settles to a ring. The aromas are dark and pungent, showing tobacco, charred meat, prune, and chocolate, leading to flavors of dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, cigarette ash, burnt toast, prune, and coffee, with medium sweetness that’s balanced by medium, lingering bitterness. The beer is medium-full in weight, medium in carbonation, and finishes relatively dry for pretty good drinkability. Overall, quite enjoyable and it’s held up very well.

Middle Ages Dragonslayer Imperial Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Middle Ages Brewing;head is an attractive dark tan on a black body. The nose has some coffee and chocolate with a hint of bubble gum and some whiffs of something medicinal. The taste has bittersweet chocolate, a thick maltiness, coffee and a hint of cherry and other dark fruits. There is more effervescence than you would expect in a Russian imperial stout, which blunts many of the taste elements.
Middle Ages Syracuse Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;On tap at The Blue Tusk (Syracuse, NY). Golden body with a thin, white frothy head. Decent malty/hoppy aroma with sweet and bready hints. Its simple malty/hoppy taste carries bready notes. Ends with a short bittersweet finish. Ordinary.
Middle Ages Syracuse Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;Bottle pour, gift from a neighbor. Clear and deep coppery color with a translucency due only to the color, this beer struggles to maintain a wispy head that sinks down to foam with strong edging and achieves decent spotting. As similar as can be in aroma and flavor, this pale ale is moderately hoppy with a focus on earth, leaf and mineral notes that make me wonder if it isn't an English version. A hint of estery sweetness comes up at the front and gives way to the bitterness, while a bit more flora comes out from middle to end. It's more prickly than crisp and bitingly so. Its light-medium body holds a certain mineral edge to it.
Middle Ages Syracuse Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Pours golden with fluffy white. Aroma is of piney hops and bready malt. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is similar to aroma. Finish is medium and dry. OK brew.

Middle Ages Syracuse Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;Tap pour into a pint glass at Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse. Kind of a pale amber with a hint of golden color. Smell is grainy and malty like frat party type ales. Taste doesn’t bring anything great to the table. Grainy/cerealy/malty and nothing in there to offset it. Thin mouthfeel. Feels like it’s really old and stale but likely it’s actually fresh from the brewery. You would hope the namesake pale ale of the city would taste better than this. Ouch.
Middle Ages Syracuse Pale Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Pale Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;Kinda old musty malt smell, improves with more smell...taste is very similar! Slightly sweet malt beer with no hops...just sugar water...no depth...

Aroma is almost all fruit with some watermelon, apple, citrus, sweet, and some malt, a touch of hops but not much. Light sourness on the palate, more fruit.

Empire Barley Wine;Syracuse, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Empire Brewing Company;Tap at Pony Bar. Hazy/cloudy amber beer topped by a tight white head. The nose is hard to parse. Sort of a sweet maltiness. Lightly candyish with a kiss of fruit but it is very subtle. It comes across very sugary initially, then a bit boozy. The hopping, although there, is nowhere near enough to balance the sweetness. Really a shockingly bland beer.

Contreras Tonneke;Gavere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Contreras;Robe ambrée clair, bronze, mousse bien calibrée, blanche, assez légère, tenue moyenne. Nez malté, doux, avec notes de caramel, bubblegum léger, banane. Moins sucré en bouche, plutôt aqueux, un peu métallique. Bière avant tout maltée, très propre, mais un peu fade. Touches herbeuse et amère légères. Petit côté caramel, doux du grain, très léger arôme d’amande. Finale très légèrement amère et courte. Corpulence fine, texture aqueuse. Ale spécial belge dans le plus pur style, légèrement douce, légère, très buvable.
Contreras Tonneke;Gavere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Contreras;25cl bottle. Bronze coloured beer. Pleasant malt aroma. Flavour is light pleasing malt and hops. Real ale like, yes, reminds me of home. It’s the soft carbonation which makes this taste very natural. A really good, uncomplicated, softly spoken ale.
Contreras Tonneke;Gavere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Contreras;"Bottle 25cl. Clear medium amber, two finger frothy off-white head, good retention and lacing; aroma is malty, light roasted, fruity (apricot, peach), candy sugar, yeast; taste is medium sweet and light bitter, malty, light caramel; medium body, oily texture, soft carbonation, aftertaste is dry hopbitter, herbal notes; no-nonsense classic speciale belge, nice."
Contreras Tonneke;Gavere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Contreras;"Sampled draft @ ZBF 2015. Clear orange amber, little head; Nose is sweetish dull, metallic, caramel, candy sugar, bit thin, iron. Taste is dull, thin candy sugar, caramel malts, bit empty,… Easy to drink. Nothing exciting but a good example of a Special Belge. (Thx! for sharing people!)"
Contreras Tonneke;Gavere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Contreras;Old school ’spéciale belge’ with pure amber colour under an off-white head and dried fruity character, more caramelly than nutty, soft mouthfeel, yeasty with gentle leafy hop bitterishness in the finish. Restrained but elegant as this style requires, ’honest’ and very thirst-quenching.
Contreras Tonneke;Gavere, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Contreras;Een bier met een heel speciale smaak, ik vond er absoluut niets aan, maar sommige zullen dit lekker vinden.
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;(can - 12 oz) Got this one out of my grandfathers fridge. He buys it because it is $9 a case. Clear yellow with a fizzy head. Aroma is sour, stale, and corn. Flavor is the same. Bitter hops, stale corn, and a metallic taste. It is a beer.
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Bought one night while slumming. Not much tast at all. What I expect from a cheap lager. Terrible aroma with a hint of garbage. The nine dollar price sums up this beer. Not recommended!
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Gawd! This almost made me gag. It tastes worse than Corona. I is a bit better in the aroma standards though. I can’t shake the smell of cat urine when i opened a Corona. Like that beer maybe a half dozen limes stuffed in it may work.
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Ubiquitous pale yellow appearance and head. Sweet and mild corn aroma, tho it says pilsner. First taste has good medium creamy carbonation. Not too offenesive. Very little industrial bitterness building. Friendly and for the most part well behaved. Finish is at times a tad watery. Almost as good as Old German or Schmidt’s. Much better and more refined than city lager or king lager. Could be a good repeatable beer, especially for the price! 33 cents a can. Hey, for the price of gas we may need to sacrifice!
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Hey at 8.50 a case in kentucky you know that this is a beer meant to get drunk with. It is definitely better than natty light so if it comes down to a choice between really cheap beers this one wins.
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent typically carbonated straw yellow colored body. The aroma was malty and grassy. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt mild hops astringent and grassy. Not one that I would buy again.
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Poured pale color with a minimal fizzy white head that diminished quickly with virtually no lacing. Light grainy citrus aroma. Light body with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Light sweet flavor with a light sweet finish of short duration. I would not recommend this to a freind.
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;We threw a rager and bought a case of this as a joke. It was watery at first, but then made me gag. Not good, but cheap. I’ll buy it for a party and let drunk people drink it.
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Abandoned in my fridge by a houseguest. Pours lemon yellow, very clear and very pale. Initially attractive white head is gone in under a minute. Dull aromas of sulphur and hot grass, sweet corn and maybe some Belgian spiciness? Hop aroma, perhaps? Flavor is lightly sweet, raw corn juice and steamed carrots, softly carbonated, Sprite. Actually, it reminds me of a sip of Zima I tried once. Body is round and light, but not watery. Semidry finish with grainy and sugary aftertaste. Far superior flavor to budweiser. A beer for white zinfandel drinkers.
Jacob Best Premium Pilsner;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;I have an old Jacob Best windbreaker I won in a racquetball tournament 25 years ago. It’s OK beer and it’s cheap.
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Put in my mouth and puked. This is the nastiest beer I have tasted ever in my life. I would rather drink toilet water with piss in it
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;i have never tried this beer but my great 10th ancestoer is the 1 who created it!
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Regretably this beer is no longer carried at my local distributer. It’s been replaced by BigCity Light. JB is an average light beer for only $10. The first few were a little rough going down. Each time I had this beer good things would seem to happen. You can’t get a better light beer for the price. I’ve even made women refer to me as Jacob Best on video while engaging is lascivious acts. RIP Jacob Best
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;This is the same as the rest of the macro lights. Fizzy and no flavor. It really is all it can be. It’s not the beers fault. It’s Dr. Frakenstein who made it.
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;good for a light beer im not to crazy about light macro beers or macros in general but its good for the money and its not horrible tasting really
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"This stuff came from a thirty five cent 12 oz can. Pop the lid and there you have a cheap apple wine and canned corn aroma. Smells like a few pilsners I’ve had. Clear yellow virtually no head, quickly diminishes, except a tea froth. Lacing is very nice and active, but it disappears quickly. A light to medium body, good creamy carbonation. Has a moderate pale lager appeal, ever so slightly sweet or even mildly less than sweet, but not even a hint of bitterness. Possess the attributes of a friendly pale lager; industrial and processed , with little personality. Interesting slight alcohol metallic bitterness gathers at the end of each sip. Has an average length finish, where a slight sour watery metallic aftertaste seems to manifest. Overall, an acceptable pale lager, especially for the price."
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Appearance was a medium sized white fizzy head that mostly diminished, virtually no lacing, transparent, and a pale yellow hue. Nose was some corn and the flavor was somewhat sweet, thin, watery and not tasteful at all IMO. Smooth, watery and thin mouthfeel. Light body. Nothing special or outstanding about this brew. I’ve rated it and moving on.
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Got this for the football game giveaway. Poured pale color with a minimal fizzy white head with virtually no lacing. Light grainy aroma. Light watery body. Light sweet flavor with a short light sweet finish. Glad I am not drinking these.
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;omg... I remember this stuff from college frat parties at IUP. Nothing will keep you next to a bathroom on Sunday morning like JB. If this is his best, I’d hate to see his worse!
Jacob Best Premium Light Beer;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Not bad nothing like most liek beer but still the micro beer taste just buy keystone i is cheap and still has abotu the same taste
Pittsburgh Gold Crown Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"I appreciate the gift from ""Cheap"". I agree with what he said ""better than I expected"". Although I do prefer the hoppy beers, I can appreciate these macro made cheap grass cutting lagers. I know cheap said that the price is right for this brew."
Pittsburgh Gold Crown Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;So its back, the ol’gold crown from stoney’s, at least that is what the guy over at santiago told me. At least I get to pad my most beer rated kingship of iron city beers and the umbrella there-of. I’m not too exited because I know this company, melanie, makes most of IC beers now. Head is pretty nice and rocky for cheappie beer. Pour is typical pale lager, except for the head of course. Taste is not too bad, is more acceptable than most melanie brewing beers. Hey, I just noticed, iron city brewing, city (melanie) brewing? some relationshipe there? hehheh. Does have a slight soapy aroma. Overall, better than I expected, I’ll have to give nike one of these. Not many rude effects, jsut plain pittsburgh lagerirsh. Yes, better than expected.
Pittsburgh Gold Crown Premium Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;I never thought i could find a beer as bad as Natty Light, until i drank Jacob Best. I thought that was the worst it could get. I was wrong. This is the most foul thing i have ever had the misfortune to drink. It is so bad the brewer doesnt mention it on their website. Foul, rancid, metallic, sulfur? odor and taste. The first one i ever drank i funneled. MISTAKE. BIG MISTAKE. Somehow i managed to keep it down for puking in a frat house is frowned upon. I took one sip out of another can, (i dont learn quickly) and that confirmed that this was the worst tasting stuff i have ever tried. Even if it was a bad batch i think i can pass on testing it again.
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);That lovely light beer yellow color, really carbonated and watery. Doesn’t have a whole lot of taste. This one said it was low carb, probably the only thing good about it.
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Been out of the area where this crap was sold for a couple of years. Sad to see it has been given the gold watch that is usually given to reitred workers. From what I remember, it was pretty much a fake tasted Blue Light. That being said, still manhadles any shit from Coors.
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);It pours a light golden color. It’s very clean and clear with a good amount of carbonation that makes a big white head. It has lots of big bubbles that leave great lacing on the glass. A light cereal, like rice chex makes up the aroma and flavor. There seems to be some faint grassy hops in the flavor as well. Fizzy carbonation gives it a bit of a bite on the tongue. The finish is quick clean and dry. Overall I would say that it has the most flavor of the low carbohydrate beers.
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"one of the better tries at getting a ""helpful low cal drink this and dont get fat"" brews. id still rather drink beer with flavor and have to run/work it off."
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);select beers are in the same group as ice beers. not good. take a hint people
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Bottled, Not much really to say it has really no odor or no taste. Verythin for my taste. Not the worst thing I ever drank but it’s not that good.
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Very unoffensive, I suppose. Not sure what else to say about it, since it doesn’t taste or smell like anything, doesn’t look like much, and is as thin as water. If you want to drink alcohol but want to keep the carbs and calories to a minimum, this fits the bill. If you want ""beer"", get something else. At least Miller Lite is a decent compromise, since it is nearly as light as this but still resembles beer in appearance and flavor. I got this as part of a mixed Labatt case, thinking some non-beerheads would drink it, but there was a bunch of Select and Blue Light left over, so I had to try it. Maybe I’m being ectra harsh because I had a couple of Labatt Canadian Ales before sampling the Select, but it only qualifies as beer in a technical sense. At least it isn’t as ridiculously carbonated as some ultra lights."
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);The aroma was week, but had hint of metallic smell to it...Which is odd since it came from a bottle. The apperance was light yellow, the head was thin white and faded quick. Flavor was thin. Pretty poor over all. If I hadn’t read the label I would have thought this was just another thin American Marco light beer. Oh, well.
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"I tell you what..........if I had to ""select"" a low carb, or low alcohol lager, this would be the one. That said, I don’t anticipate having to ""select"" one to drink any time soon. So, ultimately, I won’t be ""selecting"" this one any time soon. ALmost too poor to rate. Pale, fizzy, cardboard, corn in all areas. Rough."
Labatt Select;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Given the type of beer this is (macrobrew/ultra light) this beer is excellent. Don’t expect a Blue/light flavor - this tastes more like a lite version of Labatt Crystal. If your choices are this, Mic Ultra, Bud Select, Miller lite, etc, go for this.
Flag Hill Farm Vermont Still Hard Cyder;Vershire, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Flag Hill Farm;"Purchased at Hunger Mountain earlier today. Last one. $9.99 + VT tax for the 750 mL bottle. To undersized tasting snifter, it pours a skin-tinted amber; champagne bubbles up top, but not especially fizzy. Aromas of Macintosh apple applesauce, yams, honeydew melon rind, sunflower seeds, corn kernels, lavender, chlorine, vanilla extract, butternut squash, and tangerine zest. Tastes the same with the addition of wet cardboard, acidulated malt, white wine lees, and spent grain. Funk, durian, salted butter, and black limes experienced by swallow. A lot going on here. Yeasty and acidic."
Flag Hill Farm Vermont Still Hard Cyder;Vershire, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Flag Hill Farm;Bottle shared with my wife. Pours a clear orange amber with no head. Soft apples on the nose, dry champagne yeast, a little vinous and woody. Medium bodied, dull acidity, old apple notes, gets a bit yeasty and dry. Warm alcohol into the finish.
Flag Hill Farm Vermont Still Hard Cyder;Vershire, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Flag Hill Farm;Thanks to an ass. Transparent gold, no head. Light honey and cleaning product nose, white grape, wet wood, and apple skin. Bitter flavor is heavy apple skin, hot honey, nicely bitter. tepid body.

Flag Hill Farm Vermont Still Hard Cyder;Vershire, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Flag Hill Farm;750mL thank to nimbleprop. Pours a clear, light straw. No carbonation. Nose is heavy green olive, cloying white grape juice. Taste is tannic, boozy for style, yellow apple, white grape juice, champagne. Palate brings tart Granny Smith apple.

Aroma is light hay and plastic phenols, apple dominant with dry leaves. Flavor is lightly tart apples, dry straw and hay with a dry finish. Medium body and no carbonation.
Flag Hill Farm Vermont Still Hard Cyder;Vershire, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Flag Hill Farm;Bottle courtesy of nimbleprop, thank you sir! Hazy pale yellow color. Aroma of dusty dry apple skins. Taste is equally dry and slightly dusty apple skins. Tasty.
Flag Hill Farm Vermont Still Hard Cyder;Vershire, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Flag Hill Farm;Bottle sampled on 9/15/07: Pours a still dark golden bronze with a thin ring of white head. Aroma of earthy caramely apples with a touch of tartness. Body starts with a good light sweetness and earthy, fresh tartness toward a thinner sweet-tart finish Nicely balanced, smooth and enjoyable.
Flag Hill Farm Vermont Still Hard Cyder;Vershire, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Flag Hill Farm;Poured a clear golden color. Nice leather funk aroma with sweet red apples. The flavor also had leather and red apple skins. Light to medium bodied.
Flag Hill Farm Vermont Still Hard Cyder;Vershire, Vermont, United States;Apple Cider;Flag Hill Farm;Thanks to notalush for bringing this one out. Deep amber colour, sweet and very appley. Completely still. Fairly tart and has lots of tannic dryness. Fruity with a hint of brown sugar and soft spiciness. Lingering sweet vineous character. It could use a bit more acidity to brighten the nice aromatics on the palate. Still, a good cider.
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Originally rated March 2006. Says it is brewed by Silver Creek Brewery, Wisconsin and has a 7% ABV written on the label... even though this was bought at The Beer Store in Canada. This malt liquor pours a clean yellow-gold colour with a good white fizzy-cream head. Retention is under medium and some lace is left. Active average-size bubble carbonation. The nose is a bad mix between alcohol and metal. Wow, this is bad ! Not even good corn taste, but watery malt with mild aftertaste of apples. Alcohol is present in the flavour, but no burn, really light. Badly brewed, I suggest for malt liquor to stick with Mongoose in the can.
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Not the smoothest taste however for malt liquor it is close to regular discount beer and for that I give it some props. It may be strong but I don’t taste anything gross or overpowering about it. This is a can at a retailer near Kamloops British Columbia
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);"tasted sweet corny, its bright gold with a foamy head type thing in the bottle. tastes like a heavy forty, pretty okay but i ended up letting it get warm and got really gross at the end. the name is pretty funny because ""bull max"" wasnt enough they had to add b-40 whatever that means and has a really funny logo. a pretty solid forty because it gets you messed up quickly"
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Il faut que jeunesse se fasse...Pisse en bouteille 1.18L. Ca sent l’alchol pis ca goute l’alcool.
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Corn. Alcohol. Watery. Dry. Golden. No head. Not so good, this one. Entered from notes.
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);it’s not good, get it? Yeah you heard me, not good. in fact, as I dwell upon it, it’s downright offensive. I’ve had worse sure, but let’s be honest. This stuff is sold purely for people to get bombed, as IMHO it has no taste, aroma value at all. Bad, avoid at all costs (unless you just want to add a rating) :)
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Ahhh, highschool. Used to love these, now cant stumac it. ALTHOUGH, for a 8% 40oz, it is remarcabley beer like, far from the malt liquor taste of most of the others. Taste , smell and aftertaste are all of corn, slight malt, and heavy boose. Dry pasage down the throat. Basicly, summed up, it’s a great way to get happyer cheaper if you live under a bridge or in a park, but then how would you read this review? Cheers
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);355 ml can. Pale golden colour with a thick white head and some lacing. Aroma is pure corn, a bit of malt and cat piss. Flavour of stale cardboard, pissy flavour with alcoholic heat and thin body. Drain pour.
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Used to get smashed on these in highschool along time ago. 2 would do the trick back then. Terrible stuff but slighly better than O.E
B-40 Bull Max 8%;Guelph, Ontario, Canada;Malt Liquor;Sleeman Brewing & Malting Co. (Sapporo);Oh yeah, no if ands or buts about it. this one is a downright stinker!.....
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;Can from me Thanks to me for going out of my way to find this diamond in the rough. Har, har. Pours typical macro-thin yellow with a quickly fading head of ivory. Pleasant aroma of honey and slight raspberry. The positives end there... Watery hops that spent their summer in the sun. Dry, stale, and lifeless. Watery mouthfeel. Thank goodness I found this as a single at Spec’s.
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;"call me ""dirty stinkin ape"" but this got me up in the jim-jams...i liked it, nothing to worry about, its cold, refrshing, has a nice back taste, and for 6 for 12...dude, ""sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar eats you"" ..i won on this roll."
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;Gold Coloring. Pains me to Say, but the Light Was Easier to Drink. Corny and Light Malt Aroma and Flavor. Pretty Harsh.
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;Omg i think i prefer the light over this,golden color,small white head that had a short life then faded to nothingness.The armoa was corny and semi sweet with a light maltiness.The flavor was just slightly stronger then the light version with just a bit more maltiness and the hops are still faint.not enough to off set the sweet side of this brew but still it could be a decent lawnmower brew just for the ease of drinking.It’s worth a try atleast once but after that your on your own.
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;"Oh man is this a ""special"" beer... light yellow color. This thing is like drinking in incredibly diluted corn smoothie. Woof."
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;Wouldn’t drink again. Ok well if it were free. Light yellow in color with a stale fruity taste. A zing in the palate but not to it’s favor. All white head about half inch disappears fast. Very carbonated.
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;Bought at a Cirkle K after work. Clear yellow color with white head that disapated. Carbination was good. Tasted watery, not bad if you need beer fill for the frige or something before bed that is not to harsh.
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;Can poured yellow with fast disipating white head. Heavy aroma of corn. Flavor was of corn with a very heavy taste of metal left on the palate. For what it’s worth, the Blue Diamond light was much better!
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;Some aroma of hops. Clear yellow color. Bitter taste with a small bite, also a strange chemical taste. Very cheap beer, but drinkable.
Blue Diamond Premium Beer;St Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Blue Diamond Brewing Company;I once drank this at a frat party when it was all they had. It was in cans so I can't properly judge the appearance, but I'm assuming that looked as bad as it tasted. The flavor made me want to choke, I've only turned my back on one beer ever and this wasn't it, but it was close. UPDATE: At thos point I wonder, why did I finish at all? What was wrong with me? Probably the same thing that made me try to dance with my chick at the time, since I have no rhythm. Wow, this was a few years ago, but if it happened today, I'd be impressed that a frat party actually had something new to me, no matter how bad it was.
Masthead Island Pils;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Masthead Brewery;Perhaps it should have stayed there. On the island I mean. A really little one actually. With no people. No glasses. No bottle openers. No chance. No thanks.
Masthead Island Pils;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Masthead Brewery;nice amber colour with small head, sweet hoppy vanilla smell. not very bitter for a pils.
Masthead Island Pils;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Masthead Brewery;Thin, horrible flavour, I think a shudder just ran down my spine. Ooeeergh.
Masthead Island Pils;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Masthead Brewery;pretty bad. hard to believe this could be considered 'premium beer', watery and the wrong sort of fizz
Masthead Island Pils;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Masthead Brewery;RE-rate:Thin, not much bitterness, but easy to drink, its OK................
Masthead Island Pils;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Masthead Brewery;Hazy tan, thin body, lacking hops, vague maltiness, finishes quickly........
Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Pours orange with foamy white head. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of apricots, some herbal hops, caramel and wheat malt. Finish is long and semi-dry. Ok brew.
Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;This was poured into a nonic pint glass. The appearance was a ruddy burnt orange color with a slight transparency about it. Carbonation could be seen rising at a moderate pace to hit a slim finger’s worth of white foamy head. Dissipated at a nice pace. Moderate lace. The aroma starts and finishes with sweet apricot. Not much else there, slight grassy hops, somewhat. The flavor is all about the apricot. Grassy hops try to blend on into the aftertaste and on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a great sessionability about it. Low carbonation. Overall, fantastic sessionable apricot ale. Maybe not so much more going on, but I won’t knock it for lack of other hopeful necessities. It’s good for what it is, so lap it up on a hot day.
Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;refreshing and with a nice authentic apricot flavor and good body and malt at the finish. surprisingly good at the brewery on tap.
Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;Poured into a pint glass. 2.0 A: Clear light orange color. Two fingers of fizzy white head that falls super fast and leaves just a whisp or two of lacing. 3.0 S: Smells of moderate apricot and a light graininess underneath. Not much else going on. Fortunately, the apricot is powerful enough for the nose on this to be sufficiently decent. 2.0 T: Unlike the nose, the apricot in the taste fails to even achieve half-assdom. That coupled with the lack of anything interesting underneath, puts this at the level of shitty fruit beer. Clean, weak, and boring. 2.0 M: Lighter body. There’s way too much carbonation. Indeed, this is easily BMC level. No creaminess and the carbonation makes this hard to put down easily. 2.0 D: We’ve all seen this plenty of times with fruit beers, so I doubt I’d need to explain why this beer sucks much.

Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Pours gold with a creamy off white head. Aromas of pale malt and apricot. Light bodied, refreshing, fruity. Faint bitterness on the finish. I enjoyed this beer, refreshing with a nice apricot presence without being overdone, a pretty solid summer beer.
Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;Twelve oz. bottle, 10.03.09. Pours cloudy gold, white head. Aroma is apricot and malt. Flavor is malty, hoppy, apricot. On the bland side but at least this isn’t offensive.
Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;On tap at Middle Ages brewery. Decent mildly fruity aroma. Very sweet apricot taste. Sweet but not artificial tasting. Too sweet for my liking but a very solid fruit beer for sure
Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;"[2349-20090731] Tap. Fruity apricots aroma. Lightly hazy, light brown body with quick creamy off-white head. Lots of sweet apricot and fruit flavour. Medium body.

Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;2009-07-31. Golden body with a modest white head. Aroma is very fruity, apricots, touch of yeast. Flavour is similar, muted malt is overshadowed by dominant fruit, apricots. Very light bitterness. Average palate. Okay, I am not particularly an apricot beer fan. On tap at the brewery
Middle Ages Apricot Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Middle Ages Brewing;Traffic-light amber color. Ivory head disappears quickly. Clear and watery. The sweet fruity apricot smell is balanced by a bready, wheat-like yeast. The fruit smells fresh and not saccharine. Excellent for style. The taste is an excellent handshake between the slightly sour and sweet apricot, and the bready, estery yeast. The balance is crucial and keeps this beer from tipping toward saccharine. A nice, solid brew. The feel is thick but smooth. The yeast adds a necessary dryness. It’s a solid fruit beer. Balance is the key, and the sweet/dry sides make it repeatable.
Middle Ages Old Marcus;Syracuse, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;On cask. It’s back! Coppery pour with a little bit of off-white head that has yeast and bready malt in the aroma. The English hopping had apple notes and the malt was a tasty bread dough and biscuit-like flavor. Good malty body. The Alcohol was hidden well. Great after a hike in Letchworth with Patty, Andy and Kara.
Middle Ages Old Marcus;Syracuse, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Pours gold with a tan head. Aroma is very faint with some earthy hops and tea. Taste is a bit fruity, light hoppy bitterness on the finish. A bit disappointing.
Middle Ages Old Marcus;Syracuse, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;"Very clear, bright orange head: a ""real amber"" (ie. not ""beer amber"") color. Crystal clear. Nice foamy head. Heavy yeast (which is fine with me) with a sweet malt. Slight hop presence, but the ringwood yeast definitely dominates. Nice balance. Heavy sweet malt flavor with secondary hop undertones. Major bready yeast flavor. Tastes like a standard pub ale with heavy yeast base. Flowery yeast taste/aftertaste. Medium body with a thick finish. Slightly flat, but not too bad. Slightly dry, but also refreshing. Smooth, but with a bite. I really really like this beer. A growler could be drained in an afternoon."
Middle Ages Old Marcus;Syracuse, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;on tap at the brewery. Dark brown with little to no head. Kind of thickish syrupy feel with some alcohol in the finish. Good beer to have with a meal. Wouldn’t buy again
Middle Ages Old Marcus;Syracuse, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;Cask at Barcade. The end of the cask with associated yeast. Muddy dark brown beer. Aroma of soft earthy chocolate, caramelly maltiness and a very yeasty flavour. The finish shows a lovely UK earthy/spicy hop flavour. Earthy and fairly persistent bitterness. Even in this condition, it’s not bad, and if I’d arrived a bit earlier it would have been even better. Some fairly assertive cherry/berry esters. Lingering cocoa.
Middle Ages Old Marcus;Syracuse, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;"Cask at Barcade. Dark orangy brown in color. Some fruit in the aroma. The taste was also very sweet and fruity, and the alcohol was slightly noticable. Good mouthfeel; enjoyable."

Middle Ages Old Marcus;Syracuse, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;Cask at Mahars. Pours with big bubbly head, orange color. Aroma is euro hops, grassy. Flavor is grassy hops, and somewhat light and sweet.
Middle Ages Old Marcus;Syracuse, New York, United States;Strong Ale - English;Middle Ages Brewing;(cask @ The Old Toad - Rochester, NY) Coppery color with a thin tan head. Aroma is a small amount of hops mixed with a big nose of malts and lots of butter. The taste was very malty and buttery. Almost too buttery. Some slight hops at the end, but not that much. Aftertaste had some floral notes to it.
Middle Ages Black Heart Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Middle Ages Brewing;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a cap of a little white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Some stringy yet messy lace. The aroma had a good amount of dark chocolate with some roasted malt and coffee. Slight smokiness. The flavor takes the previously mentioned aromas to blend nicely. Some dark fruits come in to excite my tastebuds. A touch of breadiness. Quick semi-sweet aftertaste with a crisp sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about medium bodied with a fair sessionable sort of smooth feel rolling all around. Low carbonation, but I didn’t mind. ABV felt fine. Overall, a sweet stout with an English twist? Yup, sure is and a worthy one of coming back to.

Middle Ages Black Heart Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Middle Ages Brewing;Growler shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike! The beer is dark brown with a small, tan head that leaves sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma brings some chocolate, smoke, and light roast. The beer is smooth and tasty, with a subtle sweetness throughout. The body is rather thin, with fairly low carbonation (I’ll take the serving medium into consideration). The finish is smooth, and leaves lingering notes of smoke and roast. Overall, a tasty brew and easy to drink. I would have this again. Serving type: growler Reviewed on: 06-19-2011

On tap, a very dark thick beer, wtih a nice chocolaty aroma with moka coffee. Beautiful taste of choclate cake with some stewed fruits, bitterness from choclate malts. Good bodied.
Middle Ages Black Heart Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Middle Ages Brewing;Thanks to Mike for this... Looks great, dark brown, borderline black with a huge medium mocha head, great retention and lace... Smells like an oatmeal stout, creamy, vanilla, milky a touch to sweet, a touch of chocolate, lacks balance... Lots of coffee on the front, a bit of ash, ashy feel as well, a bit of sweet finish on the back, super easy to drink, one of the better english stouts I’ve had
Middle Ages Black Heart Stout;Syracuse, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Middle Ages Brewing;On tap at the Chapter House in Ithaca last weekend. Served in a pint glass. Currently the #1 English Stout, and deservedly so. Pours near black with a moderately-thick tan head. Good retention and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward a good amount of dark chocolate along with some roasted malt and coffee. Good combination. Slight smokiness to it as well. The flavor really combines all of these elements quite well. As with all of the beers I had from them, there was a touch of diacetyl, but it fit in well with the style. Way to use that English yeast. The smoke really makes this beer. Medium body with a slightly-smokey and dry finish. Still some body to pick it back up. Really solid. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 06-04-2011

Middle Ages Kilt Tilter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Middle Ages Brewing;Disappointing, especially at 9% abv. There was almost no nose to the bottle I sampled.

Middle Ages Kilt Tilter;Syracuse, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Middle Ages Brewing;26-Feb-14 (22-oz bottles: Obtained in trades with jah noth and Eyedrinkale, thanks Dan and Mike!) This beer pours a hazy, medium-brown body with half an inch of tan head that settles to a creamy ring. The nose is deeply malty, with a caramely, toasty aroma, plus a bit of dried fruits. On the palate, while it’s intensely and richly malty with loads of caramel and chocolate, it’s also toasty enough that the beer isn’t overtly sweet, but not roasty, so the bitterness is mild. There are also background flavors of prune, brown sugar, and molasses. The beer is full bodied but not heavy or sticky, and carbonation is light-medium. Overall, this is quite an enjoyable Scotch Ale, very malty and rich, but not too sweet, so it’s relatively easy to drink.

Stringy glossy lace. The aroma has some toffee malts, figs, super light amount of chocolate and toast. Vanilla sweetness as well. The flavor leans malty sweet with a graceful attempt of low grassy bittering hops. Toasty vanilla warmth enters in on the aftertaste with the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable to sipping quality about it. Alcohol warmth wants to show some pizzazz but maintains a good background. Slyly smooth on my tongue. Overall, really nice English styled strong ale perfect for this time of the year, of course I would have this again.

Ipswich Winter Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - English;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz into a pint. Pours a mellow plum and medium brown, a concoxing mix at that. Head is flat, taste is granola chewy, dark fruits, and malty rasins. A thumbs up to this winter, as it passes the grade of just that, a winter. But exceding that factor is not an factor here. Bland spices of winter and of passover, this one omits a typical experience in a winter brew. Good, but not great. Still worthwhile.
Ipswich Winter Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - English;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Aroma of currants and chocolate malt. Soupy light brown appearance. It has the overall character of an English old ale, but is more bitter than most examples. Chalky, rough consistency that reveals the malt backbone of the beer. A solid entry.

Ipswich Winter Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - English;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz Bottle, purchased at Downtown Wine & Spirits - Somerville, MA. A warm, settled, strongly nutty aroma with a relaxed perfume of hazlenuts and gentle caramelization. This is a cozy beer, but it has some rough edges. There’s a harsh bitter edge mid-palate, that’s surprising and jarring. The brown flavors have a little too much of that proto-umami soy sauce burn to them. Otherwise, this sailor appreciates a little warmth and beefiness after a long day of wind and waves.
Ipswich Winter Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - English;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with a light tan head.

Off-white, loose head and a deep orange golden blonde colour, even leaning towards amber and in that sense clearly darker than usual for the style but comparable to Hoegaarden Spéciale, by which it is probably inspired. Sweet aroma of caramel, crystal malt, wheat, honey and orange; taste fruity sweetishness, caramel-like maltiness, not cloying, quite thin mouthfeel and little hops with a somewhat watery finish. Never found the other Bosta beers Sint-Servattumus made and frankly I was surprised none of them had apparently made it to this site yet."

Magic Hat Chaotic Chemistry;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);I agree with Shaftie here, this one was just oxidized and had slipped from its perch. A beer that was bottle in 2002 has no shame in being over-the-hill. It was still interesting to try, the bourbon had certainly left some impression and the nose was still decent. It’s weird to think that once upon a time, Magic Hat was making extremely interesting, creative beers that pushed forward our appreciation of Barrel-Aging. For that reason alone I cannot hate. They were putting Barley Wines in barrels when I wasn’t even Bar Mitzvahed.

The taste is sweet up front with sweet bourbon, vanilla and cameral to start. By midway smooth oak notes enhance the other flavors. Into the finish some dark fruity esters are noticed along with persistent vanilla, caramel, bourbon and smooth oak running deep into the after taste. This beer is a bit out of balance with the barrel notes smothering the beer. It could easily age much longer too. Good stuff.

Aroma of pale malts, honey, some grass and some wet dog. Soft, sweetish taste, bit sugary (although I think another kind of sweetening agent has been used here), smooth and a bit honeyish, bit metallic, thin mouthfeel, no real finish. Stereotypical blond table beer without any ambition, just a plain daily drink not indended for tasting purposes at all, but isn’t that the whole idea behind table beers?

Malty aroma of grains, wet hay, liqueur, almonds, dried peaches, herbs, and some alcohol. The flavour is similar and is quite malty with some dried fruits and alcohol. Has a slick mouth feel, full-bodied and a light bitterness. Malty and heavy, and a little boozy.
Caulier Bon Secours Blonde de Noël;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Caulier;Wenn man sich nicht nur auf Adventmärkten mit teurem Punsch, der im Einkauf 0,50 €/l kosten betrinken will, dann sollte man einen Blick auf die belgischen Weihnachtsbiere werfen. So wie in Deutschland und Österreich oftmals ein Weihnachtsbock angeboten wird, so braut fast jede bekannte belgische Brauerei ein eigenes Weihnachtsbier. DIes ist ein mit 10% Alkohol ein stärkerer Vertreter, der aber auch mit allerlei feinen Aromen daherkommt. So sind die klassischen Weihnachtsgewürze wie Anis, Zimt, Kardamon und Nelken herauszuschmecken. Auch Marille und Banane lassen sich ausmachen. Das Bier ist zwar dunkel-bernsteinfarben, hat aber wirklich, wie der Name sagt, einen blonden Charakter. So ist es mäßig spritzig und kommt mir nicht ganz so schwer vor, wie die meisten klassischen Weihnachtsbiere.
Caulier Bon Secours Blonde de Noël;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Caulier;Blond orangé, plein de levure en suspension, belle mousse claire qui tient, très forte carbonatation. Au nez, de l'alcool, un peu de malt. En bouche, c'est très dense et sucré, avec une amertume qui éclot en fin de bouche. Du toast caramélisé, des épices (coriandre?), et l'alcool assez sensible. Un peu trop corpulent, peut devenir écoeurant.

New Glarus Copper Kettle Weiss;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;New Glarus Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from secret santa many years ago rating from notes. Pours a hazy honey golden brown color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have caramel, bananas, cloves, some citrus character, toasted malts, just a hint of earthy bitterness, solid drinkable beer but what else would you expect.
New Glarus Copper Kettle Weiss;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;New Glarus Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes: pours a nice amber color. Bready and floral on the nose. Floral and cereal like on the palate. This one is an interesting combo of flavors.

New Glarus Copper Kettle Weiss;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;New Glarus Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours a dull murky dull auburn-brown with soda-like carbonation that forms a fizzy bubbly head. Aroma is a strange but not entirely unpleasant combination of tart yeast and brown sugar. Flavor is sweet brown-sugary malt, modestly bitter grassy hops, wheat bread, and a touch of honey. Palate is strangely thick and a bit cloying with chewy sweet finish. Really quite a boring beer, and rather a letdown considering the high praise and rating it’s garnered here on Ratebeer. Granted this bottle was about 5 years old and was not always stored in optimum conditions so that may have effected the taste. But I’ve had several similarly situated NG products that came through the ordeal tasting quite brilliant.

New Glarus Copper Kettle Weiss;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;New Glarus Brewing Company;"Pours out a light amber/light copper color with an initial 1"" frothy cap. The head melted nearly immediately and the body is crystal clear. First aroma impressions are honey and apple juice with a light kick of alcohol. I swirled the last few ounces I left in the bottle and I got a murky rust color. The dustyness of the malts came on strong after the bottle swirl and the mouthfeel really improved. The crackers and fruit notes also really got kicked up a notch after the swirl. I know it’s nothing new but the beer really does improve with the dregs included in the beer."

Felix Kriek;Vichte, West-Vlaanderen, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Verhaeghe;Bottle at Kulminator, vintage 2000. Reddish with a small head. Still some cherries in this one. Not that tart. A relaxed and easy to drink one.
Felix Kriek;Vichte, West-Vlaanderen, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Verhaeghe;"One of the beers continued elsewhere after Clarysse’s demise. Very sweet, only slight sourishness and no oud bruin character, totally different from the original version (on 75 cl), which was a real oud bruin kriekenbier with actual sour cherries and all nice things about oud bruin (lactic acidity, malt complexity, fruitiness). I have no idea why they made it more bland and much more sweet afterwards, should be two different beers here; I will rate it here in the more recent 25 cl version."
Felix Kriek;Vichte, West-Vlaanderen, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Verhaeghe;Bottle. Cloudy brownish maroon color, medium off white head. Aroma of fruit and fruitcake. Taste is mildy sour cherries, lemons. Not bad.

Felix Kriek;Vichte, West-Vlaanderen, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Verhaeghe;"1972 vintage bottle at home. This was closed with only a cork and is one of the original unsweetened bottles that used to be produced until the 1980s. Label reads ""Felix Kriek Speciaal"". It had held up extremely well considering it’s 40 years old! Reminded me of Rodenbach Grand Cru crossed with Goudenband. The cherry profile had mostly disappeared, however there where hints of the fruit throughout. The sourness was strong and certainly equal to the Rodenbach. Carbonation was low but even when new im guessing it was low as the cork was not clamped down or caged but just put in like a bottle of wine. Possibly the best conditioned vintage beer I’ve tried."
Felix Kriek;Vichte, West-Vlaanderen, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Verhaeghe;20 year old bottle at DRBM. The aroma has some marzipan, fruits, cork. Murky brown coloured beer with an off-white head. The taste is quite sweet, light sourish and has some caramel, light cork tones, cherries. Bit oily/sticky mouthfeel. Well kept, is quite a nice desert beer.
Felix Kriek;Vichte, West-Vlaanderen, Belgium;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Verhaeghe;2000 Vintage (supposedly – the bottle had a best before strip dating from ‘88 – ’92) 75 cl. bottle shared @ Kulminator – brewed at Clarysse – A: murky brown with a hazy musty red hue, small rusty white head, mysterius brown sediment – S: this clearly had some sweetness in it before (actually going by the taste it was probably pretty damn sweet & still quite is) – smell is not that good due to the aging and this, not much of a factor for me but everyone else found it revolting, pure cobwebs, lots of rotting cellar, rotting cherries & most of all rotting aspartame – T: glazy, thinned out arpartham cherries coated with cherry grenadine mixed with cellar, musty, rotting touch, fermenting cherries in the finish, lots of cobwebs & very dusty in the end – B: dusty really with some medium glazy qualities – Aging beers like this remains mostly the work of a madman for me & a typical Kulminator thing – curious & curiosity

Mais il y a deux mots dont je n’aime pas trop que l’on abuse … D’abord « merveilleuse » et ensuite « bière d’abbaye ». Le côté merveilleux, c’est au dégustateur d’en décider, et non au brasseur !! (Trop facile...) Ensuite, les bières d’abbaye, en affichant le dessin d’un grand bâtiment sur une étiquette, c’est un peu terminé ce genre de choses … tout au moins, depuis que les vraies bières d’abbaye sont les bières d’abbaye reconnues. Mais en Belgique, il y a toujours des nostalgiques pour trouver une abbaye à chaque coin de rue !! Donc on n’en sort pas, et on vous en sert une nouvelle chaque mois … En l’occurrence, celle-ci date de 1899, ce n’est vraiment pas historique !!!! Mon exemplaire était à 9 mois après sa date limite. Couleur doré soutenu brillant, à la clarté nette. Bulles très fines, en plusieurs fontaines vives. Très joli. Mousse blanche bien crémeuse, stable à 3 mm. Superbe. Arômes de malt clair, pointe de girofle, houblon amer, pointe de citron vert, croûte de pain. 1ère bouche très souple, avec malt, fruits blancs, pointe de vin blanc moelleux. Arrière-bouche dense, avec une amertume fleurie très belle. 2ème au très joli ensemble, bien plein fruité et malté. Arrière-bouche avec un bel équilibre. 3ème équilibrée, mais un rien aqueuse à la déglutition. Arrière-bouche très agréable, avec une belle amertume. Longueur qui donne de beaux moments, du fruité, des saveurs délicates, un rien fleuries. Jambes fines, serrées, groupées. Levure fine, un rien fruitée, belle ligne. Alcool tout à fait correct, il est efficace sur les saveurs. Finale douce, agréable, bien dans la ligne. CONCLUSION : bière très jolie, bien construite, agréable, mais comme je l’ai dit dans la présentation, on est loin d’avoir affaire à une merveilleuse !!! Surtout lorsqu’elle est décrétée, sans l’avis des dégustateurs … Ceci étant dit, pour être constant dans mes propos, je la trouve sous-cotée sur le site de ratebeer, c’est une bière qui mérite un 4 sans problème à la fois en style et en cote globale … Mais ceci n’en fait pas une « merveilleuse », j’insiste ...

Souvenir du Terroir Abdijbier Blonde (s Lands Souvenirs Blonde);Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Gouden Boom (Palm);Best Before 2004. Bottle reads 6 % , rather than the 6 % given trought he Ratebeer info. Pours clear blonde, floaties, and not much head at all. Smell is sharp, very old grains, but no typical madeira. Taste is weak, mild bitter, dry, dusty sweetness. Low to almost none carbonation. No signs of infection or anything, just more proof beers like this do not age well. Sidenote : Bottle states brewed at the dekoninck brewery in antwerp.
Souvenir du Terroir Abdijbier Blonde (s Lands Souvenirs Blonde);Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Gouden Boom (Palm);Blond session ale in the series of ’s Lands Souvenirs, commissioned by the Carrefour supermarket chain in order to promote Belgian cuisine. In spite of what is stated above, the label unambiguously states that this is / was brewed by De Koninck... I remember this as an agreeable, orange blonde beer with snow white head and a fruity, sweetish, bit honeyish character, straightforward, a bit yeasty with slight grassy hop bitterness in the finish.
Souvenir du Terroir Abdijbier Blonde (s Lands Souvenirs Blonde);Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Gouden Boom (Palm);33 cl. bottle sampled @ Kulminator. Presumably 2003 Vintage. Dark light brownish amber, little lightly off-white head. Smell is cardboard, oxidation & metal. Taste is cardboard, oxidation / honey, broken yeast, murky, old malts, lighter carbonation,… Close to hard to tell what this once used to be, okay in the regular old beer way but clearly way past the point when you should be drinking this, probably. It is still okay.
Souvenir du Terroir Abdijbier Blonde (s Lands Souvenirs Blonde);Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Gouden Boom (Palm);Bottle: from some older notes I recently found: White head on top of a darker yellow/orange colored beer. Smell hops, yeast and fruit. Taste is pretty fruity but also bitter, malty and light herby.

Souvenir du Terroir Abdijbier Blonde (s Lands Souvenirs Blonde);Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Gouden Boom (Palm);Bottle, 6.5%. Quite bready aroma. Slightly sweet and slightly vinous with a hint of earth. Hazy orange colour. Small white head. The flavour is slightly sweet with coriander notes. The bitterness a little rough.
Souvenir du Terroir Abdijbier Blonde (s Lands Souvenirs Blonde);Brugge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Gouden Boom (Palm);"(Bottle 33 cl) Comes as ""’s Lands Souvenirs du Terroir Blond Speciaalbier"" at 6% ABV. Dark golden with a small, white head. Some malt in the nose and also - I believe - some diacetyl. Big, floating algae-like formations in the lower part of the bottle - not really appetizing. Weak malty flavours, but pure and clear with a very dry, bitter finish. This may at some stage have been brewed by De Gouden Boom, but my back label clearly states, that it’s a De Koninck beer ""Dit blonde speciaalbier ’s Lands Souvenirs werd voor u grebrouwen door de Antwerpse brouwerij De Koninck"". 110705"

Angel Blond;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Gekocht in de AD Delhaize van Lebbeke op 27/05/2016. En geproefd op 8-10-2016. Angel blond is een geel-goud kleurig biertje dat er helder uitziet. Je ziet veel belletjes van een gemiddelde grootte. Het overvloeidige schuim is wit van kleur en is romig-moussig van textuur, het zakt langzaam in elkaar tot een torentje bestaande uit grote bellen. Het schuim blijft ook zeer goed aan het glas kleven. Angel blond heeft een wortig mout aroma dat ook wat hopbitter is en ook alcohol en iets kruidigs zit erin. Van smaak is Angel Blond zoetig en zeer weinig bitter, verder zoethout en alcohol in de smaak. In de mond geeft Angel Blond een volle smaak, toch wat olieachtig van textuur, tamelijk prikkelend en niet droog. Je krijgt er een verwarmend gevoel bij. De nasmaak vloeit uit, is niet bitter zuur of droog maar wel plakkerig zoet met een toetsje van de alcohol erbij. Een leuk biertje, het wortaroma is snel vergeten als je de zoete smaak en de alcohol proeft. Kortom een lekker sterk biertje.
Angel Blond;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Robe blonde, mousse peu persistante. Nez banal, malt, épice, fruit. Bouche diluée et sans complexité. Bière sans intérêt.
Angel Blond;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Quite fine supermarket beer, now with Belgian football player (some days to the European championatship). Nose is Belgian yeast, malts and a bit spices. Body is medium, stuff is bubbling, texture thick. Taste is bitter and sweet. Palate is dominated by Belgian yeasts, some spices, a bit of alcohol, some bonbonss. Sweet aftertaste. B@H
Angel Blond;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Simple golden appearance and typical light malty aroma. Some apple perhaps, fruity esters but not terribly interesting fermentation. It’s all on moderation I guess. Taste is decent enough, nothing remarkable (literally). Nice big bubble, fits the beer very well. (33cl bottle from Dekoninck)

Angel Blond;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Dumpy 33cl brown bottle, produced for the supermarket chain ’Delhaze’. The best before date was 15 July 2010, it was reviewed and poured into a Duvel glass on 7 Dec 2010, so a little out of date. A Christmas beer (the label and name gives it away somewhat!), lets hope it’s Angelic. I was doing well with the pouring, then a large amount of sediment gushed out of the bottle to contaminate the glass, this obviously tainted and dulled the body of the beer. The glass now contained a murky, cloudy bland orange coloured liquid with lumps floating about trying to sink down the beer. A scummy head sat on top. True Belgian yeasty, beery smell, a blind tasting/smelling would have told anyone straight away a Belgian beer was in their hand. Duvel like in flavour, slightly sweeter and a little stronger in the taste stakes (maybe because of the sediment in my glass?). The alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering, blends in well with the zesty feel the beer has. Considering this is a supermarket beer, it’s good stuff, can’t remember what I paid fot it, but it wouldn’t have been expensive, I’ll look out for it again when next in a ’Delhaze’. What a pity the sediment got out!

Angel Blond;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Süßlicher Antrunk, der schnell in ein säuerliches Aroma wechselt.

Postel Tripel;Alken, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerijen Alken-Maes (Heineken);"Widely distributed Tripel, bottle from a Colruyt. Pours clear golden with a big, lasting, frothy, off-white head; lots of lacing. Aroma of yeast, white bread, grass, jenever, juniper, unripe banana & yellow apple; Taste is light fruity sweet, a bit estery with apple & unripe banana, and light to medium grassy bitter, slightly spicy with a basic bready & doughy maltiness. Dryish, grassy hoppy finish but not in a very firm kind of way, some spices, lingering sweetish banana ester, warming jenever alcohol. Medium body, creamy texture, fizzy carbonation. Very correct Tripel, nothing surprising, and this has become somewhat of our 'house brand' at home. As long as it substitutes a possible Grimbergen or - God forbid - Leffe Tripel, I'm okay with that."

Schwendi;Phillippeville, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Devaux;(Bottle 25 cl) Very rare beer from the small brewery Devaux, which mostly brews low alcohol table beers. This is their only strong beer. Blonde, filtered ale with a gigantic head. Fruity, distinct sweetness and slightly spiced. I think I detect a hint of ginger. Quite solid but low carbonation, which makes it sneakily easy to drink. 110802

Limburgse Witte;Opitter-Bree, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Cornelissen;Ładny kolor cytrynowy. Piana drobniutka, bielutka. Mocno trzyma się szkła. Niestety zamerdałem puszką przed nalaniem i jest taka trochę nieestetyczna ławica czegoś (chmieliny?) Aromat mało intensywny. Chyba cytrusowy, pomarańczowy. Może i kolendra. Nasycenie w punkt. Słodkawe. Jest specyficzny smak kojarzący mi się z cukrem pudrem, przy czym nie chodzi mi o słodycz, ale to coś związane z proszkiem. W skrócie: słodowość i cytrusy. Nieco przypraw. No mega wrażenia to piwo na mnie nie robi.

Engelhardt Charlottenburger Pilsener;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);05-05-19 // tap at Rosel in berlin. Typical Eckkneipe. Smoother than Schultheiss. Softer. Less carbo. Less bitterness. Sweetish grainy.
Engelhardt Charlottenburger Pilsener;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);“Engelhardt Pilsener“ steht noch auf den Gläsern, in denen dieses Bier im Ratskeller Charlottenburg ausgeschenkt wird, aber die Brauerei Engelhardt ist schon seit vielen Jahren stillgelegt. - Goldgelb, klar. - Schlankes, recht ordentlich orangenfruchtig gehopftes, schön herbes Pils. Etwas milder karbonisiert, leicht mineralisch doch weich, etwas dünner Körper. Im Abgang zeigen sich allerdings leicht seifig-ranzige Fehlaromen, die das gute Bild beeinträchtigen. - Dennoch recht süffig.

Engelhardt Charlottenburger Pilsener;Berlin, Berlin, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Berliner Kindl Schultheiss Brauerei (Radeberger Gruppe);20th Jan 2016. Two 0.4 litre glasses from the tap in a Berlin bar. Do not see this beer so often now, but back in 1988 before the Wall came down all the Sports Clubs in West Berlin had this on Draught in their bars, it was always considered the poor mans Berliner Kindl because most pubs selling it were on the rough side of nice. Anyway the beer is now a clear golden Pilsner with a full white crown on top, just like the old days. Very little aroma, the taste is more malty than hoppy and a sweeter Pilsner than the other ones produced by it’s brewery. It’s fine, refreshing and easy to drink, but has no outstanding attributes.

Dačický Kutnohorské Výčepní Tmavé 10°;Kutná Hora, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Kutná Hora (Heineken);Draught at Dacicky in Kutna Hora, 2006. Full of rich malt taste. It’s not really sweet, just a touch of sweetness, just the way I like it. It’s not overpowering at all. Has a dry, roasted taste, moving towards a Porter. But it is still relatively light, and very good with goat cheese. Love it.

Caulier La Marchoise;Péruwelz, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Caulier;Probably the best constant brewer in the world. I've several different beers from this brewery and they are all great! This one has a sweet, nuts and abricot aroma. It's a bit cloudy with a nice head of medium sized bubbles. The colour is amber. When you take a sip it's like a tiny orgasm. Sweet, sparkling and still creamy. Some spices but mainy laurier (Dutch word, sorry). And the aftertaste ... wait till it's gone and it takes you the whole evening to drink it.
Caulier Bon Secours Framboise;Péruwelz, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Caulier;Bottled, 330ml Sing top, as L’Ampounette De Redu. Reddish brown with off white head. Harsh, over tart raspberry flavours for my delicate palate! Sour almost to the point of giving up on it. Too much for me.
Caulier Bon Secours Framboise;Péruwelz, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Caulier;Ik drink graag frambozenbier, maar dit was echt een tegenvaller. Slechtste frambozenbier dat ik al geprobeerd heb
Caulier Bon Secours Framboise;Péruwelz, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Caulier;Top-fermented fruit beer with raspberry juice. Very rocky, dense, high and stable, off-pinkish head, colour a deep cherry red, misty after adding deposit so clearly bottle-fermented. Fresh raspberry odour, sweetish but fortunately not sugary or lemonade-like, some lemon peel, vanilla, bread, gingerbread. Soft and bready malty taste, quickly overpowered by a refreshing ’real’ fruit acidity, raspberry coming right after but again no sugary lemonade effect, finishing dryish. Top-fermented fruit beers are not my favorite, but this one is honest, artisanal and well-made, I have to admit.

Caulier Bon Secours Framboise;Péruwelz, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Caulier;bottle at home... copper ... big white head ... soft toffee ... soft rasperry nose ... light bitter front ... some raspberry ... but mostly bitter and a little dull
Caulier Bon Secours Framboise;Péruwelz, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Caulier;"As so often with Bon Secours, open with care, quite a gusher right after you hear the pop... Deep red colour, not that much foam remaining after a few minutes; the foam has a touch of pink in it, not surprising for a framboise. The aroma is mix of sweet and sour from the raspberries, with some effort you can detect a beer underneath, a typical ""amber"" smell. The taste is refreshing, definitely not too sweet but not enough body either; there’s the slight sour touch from the raspberries with a rather watered down amber or blonde beer, quite bitter and a touch alcoholic. The aftertaste is a bit bitter, at times almost metallic. For me this beer is too inconsistent to be a good mix, it is as if the different tastes keep pushing each other to the background. It’s also very light on body, with medium carbonation almost adding to the light / refreshing character. Afterwards I read that it’s sugarfree which partially explains the taste. The first Bon Secours that is not a winner in my book..."

Weeping Radish Oktoberfest;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;Draught at the Weeping Radish Farm, Jarvisburg, NC. I guess this one is here again. Clear copper colour with a small light tan head. Mild sweet malt and mild sweet hops in the aroma. Bland sweet malt and some sweet hops in the flavour. Watery.

The appearance is amber with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma with a touch of paper and vinegar. The palate is thin.

Weeping Radish Oktoberfest;Grandy, North Carolina, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Weeping Radish Farm Brewery;bottle, from Raleigh Wholefoods. Ok aroma, sweet, malty, lite grassiness and sourdough. Hazed brownish orange color, small head that quickly faded to nothing, no lace. Bittersweet flavor, malty, fruity. caramel, apple, tad sour too. Medium body, watery mouthfeel, tart finish. Not one to get excited about, though I had minor hopes that this brewery would nail an Ofest.

Pours slightly hazy dark amber with no head (and little fizz). Deep German malt aroma. Weak watery malty flavor, with some spicy notes and a dry salty finish. Almost dead flat with a watery body to boot. Carbonated, this might have promise, but my bottle was a dud and the score reflects it.

Crown City Black Bear Stout;Pasadena, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Crown City Brewery;Black and dense with an impressive tan foam that sits well. Aroma is pretty subtle, some creaminess, a subdued coffee, and slight smokiness. This really doesn’t tell you about the boldness of flavors that follow. It’s thick in body but surprisingly drinkable with good signs of carbonation. A heavy malt sets in the flavor, with a deep roasty coffee flavor, more so than in other stouts I’ve tasted. There’s a less obvious caramel and creamy smoothness, while the aftertaste is dry and slightly bittering. The smooth, creamy coffee characteristics that dominate the flavor linger well and satisfyingly long into the aftertaste.
Westwood JW Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Draft. Pours a clear golden color. Aroma and taste are citrus and some hops.
Westwood JW Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On tap at the Westwood Brewing Company. Just labeled as WBC Pale Ale. Aroma of light grapefruit. Long lasting rocky white head covering a clear golden body. Taste is lightly hoppu up front with some light crystal and bready malts. Somewhat watery, especially next to their IPA. Dry mouthfeel with slightly harsh carbonation.
Westwood JW Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;This beer poured a golden color with hints of orange in the sun. A massive thick white head engulfed the glass and make drinkability an issue for about two full minutes. The aroma was a citrusy, hoppy masterpiece. The taste was definitely hoppy up front, fairly fresh with an orangey tang in mid sip. It ended nicely with a hint of malt in the finish. A mild degree of carbonation, but definitely a genuine taste. A slight wheaty/grainy finish pulls this down.... I cant quite figure out that aftertaste, but its strange for sure!
Westwood JW Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Had at Westwood Brewing: Light amber hue with small head and no lace. Aroma hinted of grapefruit, tangerine, light pine, toasted malt, and leather. The taste was clean with good balance between sweet malt and fruity hops. Mild bitterness on finish. The problem with this beer is the thin palate and papery tone. Very simple, easy to drink common ale. For people who like macro beer.
Westwood JW Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;"(cask) According to BJ's as of today, they still contract brew this for Westwood..it was labeled as ""BJ's JW pale ale"" at the real ale fest in SoCal..yellowish orange with a thick head..subtle mango hoppiness making for a nice balanced pale..nothing more to say really."
Westwood JW Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Massive soapy foam coats this amber brew. A definite irish spring and citrus aroma on this one. Slight hops in the flavor that is fairly weak bodied, but is kind of refreshing, just without the power of a solid beer.
Westwood JW Pale Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Very light in color, almost lager-like. Fresh and piney nose with good signs of citrus, which comes through in the flavor. Mixture of lemon and grapefruit but subtle and sweet rather than bitter and tangy. A light, refreshing and easy drinking pale ale that would certainly work well on mainstream lager drinkers. There’s not a whole lot of depth or body, but it does work pretty well as a friendly beer. It certainly makes a great session beer and is particularly suited to summertime.
Westwood Ruby Red Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Tasty. Berry and honey taste. Little after-taste. Great middle. Very little head on it. Having been a UCLA student, I tasted this beer a lot (the brewery is across the street from campus).
Westwood Ruby Red Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Eh. A semi-sugary beer that just didn''t impress me. Struck me as though someone had dumped some sugar in a Killians. Not impressive. Heard they are changing brewmasters though.
Westwood Ruby Red Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Dark reddish-purple color. Nose is a little perfumey with some subdued fruitiness. Spritzy carbonation, pretty light, predominantly sweet and malty, sugary, berry-like, slightly toasty and a light herb. There’s some bitterness in the finish that balances the beer out well, while there is some sweetness in the aftertaste that was a little short-lived.
Westwood Honey Porter;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Porter;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Sweet, refreshing. Not over-powering. Dark and flavorful. Nutty finish...
Westwood Honey Porter;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Porter;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;First looks are deceiving, black in color looking almost espresso-like, with a nice head. I really didn’t get much in the nose though, a little malt, a little flowery but otherwise very clean. It was also very light on the palate and didn’t create too much interest at all. The flavors were certainly much better, if not exceptional, with a noticeable malt and a lingering honey aftertaste. This one was certainly a disappointment, lacking in character and not really offering much to talk about.
Westwood Scottish Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Scottish Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On draught at the Las Vegas location. Poured reddish amber, with a light head and moderate lacing. The flavor was malty, a little sweet, with hints of smoke. Nice smooth finish. A fine drinking ale.
Westwood Scottish Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Scottish Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;BJ’s Mesa AZ Dark amber with a nice creamy head and lacing that hangs on to the inside of the glass. Aroma is sweet,light roast and yeast? Bitter, light metalic flavor at first that leads into raisins and caramel. Light body with a sweet caramel like finish. Smooth, easy drinking beer.
Westwood Scottish Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Scottish Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Tap at Mesa, Az Location. Had a mild sweet maly aroma and flavor. Some roasted aroma. Medium bodied brew that was smooth and easy to drink with a meal. Dark body and small head.
Westwood Scottish Ale;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Scottish Ale;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Very dark brown color verging towards black. The nose is full of malt and smokiness, which also comes through in a bold and well-pronounced flavor, while there is a slight bitterness in the finish. The dry smokiness is just balanced out in the aftertaste by a little lingering malt. Pretty easy drinking for the style, medium to full in body, and very satisfying. It’s a very good interpretation of its kilt wearing counterpart, full in body and flavor.
Free State #1073 Prairie Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout;Free State Brewing Company;"A decent stout, not particularly surprising as it comes from Free State. A little ""nutty"" for my taste; in fact, it reminds me a bit of a chik-O-stick. The hops were surprisingly present, and this was a relief given the sticky opening."
Free State #1073 Prairie Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout;Free State Brewing Company;"This is just a tasty stout. There is nothing really ""adult"" about it, the sweetness of the molasses is definitely balanced. Wonderfully smoothed and one to revisit every year."
Free State #1073 Prairie Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout;Free State Brewing Company;Thick reddish- black in color, nice thick and creamy tan head, nice lasting lace. Aroma of burnt sugar and chocolate, roasted, coffee, molasses and chocolate, nice burnt bitterness. Medium body with a thick and creamy mouthfeel, burnt bitter and sweet finish, a pretty good stout.
Free State #1073 Prairie Stout;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Stout;Free State Brewing Company;Toasty malt aroma, with a hint of the molasses. Very dark, opaque brown/red color, almost black. Rather nice head, creamy consistency. Flavor profile is most certainly about the dark malts, although there are some hops noticable towards the end. Tastes like there is a nice variety of malts in this beer, not just a couple of kinds. Decent complexity. I like this beer, the molasses adds a nice character, and it's full of roasted flavors. I wouldn't call this a dry stout, though... Just not dry enough to fit that category, I suppose.
Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Tap, ADT. Pours dark brown with reddish edges and a thin tan head. Spiced nose, flavors are malt, chai, cinnamon, cocoa, nutmeg, some caramel notes and light roast coffee. Light-medium carb, medium body. Lingering, warming winter spice finish. Overall tasty, the score probably inversely related to the temp outside.
Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Tap at bells brewery. Spice aroma and flavor in a mild stout. Full bodied, yet mild finish. Good beer
Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Way too busy for a stout but comes together with a basic drinkability.

Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;A good stout overall. Pours a deep black with a tan head. Smells of ginger, pepper and caramel. Taste is very herby, with more ginger, caramel and pepper in the finish. Had on tap at Green Dragon.

Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Draft at WOB--black to dark brown color with a small head that leaves a good portion of lacing. Large aroma of coffee. Taste of cocoa, sugar, malt and maybe maple, could be from the sugar. After a while, the drink warms and you can taste the ginger, especially on the finish as it helps to knock down the bitter roast.
Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Draft. Nose is moderate to high ginger with a coffee presence. Overly roasted aroma like burnt coffee. Moderate green pepper aroma. Not inviting. Pitch black with minimal head. Taste is very floral like potpourri, ginger. Not much maple or molasses. Maybe a touch earthy. Kind if a muddled mess honestly.
Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Draft at Cappy’s, served in a flight. This is one I’d been intrigued by for a long time after seeing the picture of the old bottle, but never expected to see. Fun to see it on draft again after all these years. Anyway, it pours a deep brown with amber highlights and a small khaki head that settles into a ring and film, leaving trailing lace in the glass. Notes of toasted sugar, cocoa, roasted malts, nutmeg, earth, tobacco, maple, ginger, and molasses. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a roasty, spicy, sweet mouthfeel that also hits the umami notes. Not sure it should be in the S/H/V category, honestly, but deserves stout categorization.
Bell's Harry Magill's Spiced Stout;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Draft to snifter from Cappy’s pours opaque black with thin tan head.

Game One tonight... might as well roll out a beer that looked suspect in its oversized (.95l) can... GLASSWARE: Erdinger weisbier...pours a murky golden body, reasonably clear but sallow at its base... bubbles range from streams to bloated soloists... its head is off-white, bulbous but quickly thinning foam... tart lemon, faint bubblegum, some banana, and sugars that flirt with a lager-like intention... its body is rather pedestrian, smooth but thin and without much life... in fact, it is flat and grounded as a lager might be... a buttery finish, lingering slightly, leaves little trace but doesn't encourage the next sip with its flavor... lemon zest, bubblegum, freshly mowed hay, seltzer, dandelion, and light pepper... this works as a hefeweizen, but it isn't much more than a tart rinser.... not fresh, zesty, or flavorful enough to place this in a higher echelon...fitting for a finals without the Cavs...

Valentins Hefeweissbier Dunkel;Pirmasens, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Parkbrauerei;500ml can from Metro, drunk at home on a frigid November evening. Pours thickly hazy with a long-lasting, mousse-like head, heavy lacing and even some rising carbonation visible through the haze. Deep brown in colour. Aroma of banana and bubblegum with notes of sweet caramel in the background. In the mouth, high carbonation gives an initial frothy texture but by the back of the palate it is thin and watery, rich flavours of sweet caramel, star anise, banana and clove, quite a bit of sweetness with sourness creeping in before the medium-length, mildly bitter finish. Overall, good-looking and aromatic, but lacklustre mouth-feel separates this enjoyable Dunkelweizen from true greatness.

Catamount Wassail;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Catamount Brewing;Reviewed from notes. And this was fresh at the time. Holy moley, this review is old, and thanks Kate! This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a brown color with a thin off-white head that leaves immediately. The smell had cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, toffee, light cocoa powder. The taste was mainly sweet through the previously mentioned flavors. Previously mentioned spices play a lower key. Light roast in the aftertaste. Quick wet sweet finish. Light bodied, with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt low. Spices seem to hit fair on my tongue, seemed authentic. Overall, as a winter warmer, it works, not sure what everyone else’s complaints were, maybe they just don’t like the style.

Catamount Wassail;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Catamount Brewing;12-oz. Thanks, Luiss! This must be a seriously old beer today in 06. Pours a deep brown with a thin off-white head that doesn’t stick around. Deep ebony brownish black. Big cinnamon nutmeg caramel toffee nose. Bold attack: high body, active carb, bold flavors: cinnamon, nutmeg, toffee, caramel, some roast in there and just a dash of crisp herbal hop bitterness at the finish to close down things for the night. This is really tasty stuff. Shame to see it went the way of the dodo.

Catamount Wassail;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Catamount Brewing;Bottled. I see a lot of complaints about 'overspicing' not just on this, but other holiday brews. That's the point, dammit! Personally, I loved this one, from the deep red translucent look of it, through the awesome super-spicy nose of cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and allspice, to the rich spicy, slightly sweet flavor. Could be a bit thicker and maltier, but I'm not complaining.
Catamount Wassail;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Catamount Brewing;Wonderful nutmeg/pumpkin pie spice aroma. Light orangish body, light head. Taste is not just spicy-- but fruity as well. Perhaps a mild black cherry flavor. Well modulated malt and bitter finish, which is sharp, but not necessarily hop-flavored. A pleasing Holiday brew.
Catamount Wassail;White River Junction, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;Catamount Brewing;Slightly overspiced with cinnamon and ginger. Almost tasted like the red hot balls candy with a hotness to the spices. Nice looking with a good spicy aroma. A little thin on the body as well. Hopefully 2001 will be better.

St. Sebastiaan Grand Réserve;Meer, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Sterkens;Strong, sweet, dark...dark fruits, candy, raisins. Not my style of beer but a well made one.
St. Sebastiaan Grand Réserve;Meer, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Sterkens;Transfer from BA review on 1-7-14- Poured from bottle into a chalice glass Appearance – The beer pours a nice lightly hazed orange amber color with a two finger billowy white head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading to leave some great levels of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is strongest of a sweet biscuit malt smell being a mix of toasted Belgian malt smells mixed with some sweeter caramel and bubblegum like aromas. Along with these aromas are some other fruitier notes of a lighter fruit variety. Apple, pear, apricot and citrus are all there and are joined by a bit of a banana smell brought along by a yeasty smell. Along with these aromas are some very light alcohol/boozy smells and a little bit of coriander and clove. Taste – The taste begins with somewhat fruity and biscuity taste. The fruit is a mix of apricot, pear, grape and banana which overall bring a moderate level of sweetness to the brew. The fruity flavors remain throughout the taste, but the sweetness associated with them seems to lessen as the biscuit takes on a slightly grainier flavor and some more bitter lemon and a bit of grassy and hay come to the tongue. Toward the end however, the sweeter flavors seem to kick back in with a bit of a honey and caramel coming to the tongue. Along with these sweeter flavors, so too comes some spice of clove and coriander, and with a little bit of a alcohol taste, the brew ends up leaving a somewhat warming and grainier biscuity fruited flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the medium side for a brew of 10 % abv. with a carbonation level that is average as well. Overall the body and carbonation are rather decent for the brew’s style, although a slightly higher carbonation may have been a bit better for the slightly grainy biscuit and lighter fruit flavors of the brew. Overall – An alright Belgian Strong Pale ale, but at almost $8.50 for the smallish (16 oz?) ceramic gasket resalable bottle (which is pretty cool) it is rather overpriced. A good one to try, but not worth going back to again, as there are better (and far less pricy) Belgian strong pale’s out there.
St. Sebastiaan Grand Réserve;Meer, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Sterkens;Appearance: Slightly hazy orange body with a thick fluffy white head. Not much lacing.

Outer Banks Mutiny Pale Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;I love pale ales, but this one turned me way off. Again, way too water, not much body, next to no head, too hoppy

Outer Banks Altimeter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at OBX Brewing Station. Clear copper in color with a small white head and a little lacing. Rather faint aroma of caramel and nuts. Not too much going on really. The flavor is caramel malt, nuttiness, and cardboard oxidation. Not very exciting. Medium-bodied with average carbonation. This beer did not really impress me overall, and is probably the worst beer I’ve had from OBBS.
Outer Banks Altimeter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Nice malty and caramel notes with a bit of spice, too. Pretty simple but easy to drink and nothing offensive. Solid beer.
Outer Banks Altimeter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at the pub. Clear amber color with a small off white head that left sticky lace on the side of the glass. Nose of dusty grains with some nuttiness. Flavors of apple fruitiness, peaty earthiness and a subtle bitter finish. Tastey beer but not that interesting.
Outer Banks Altimeter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Part of my brewery sampler and pretty light for an alt (American Amber?) with some hops in there but nothing aggressive.
Outer Banks Altimeter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Tried this with a sampler at the brewery. Pours a slightly cloudy brown with a medium head. Aroma of malt with a bit of fruit sweetness. Taste is very good. Somewhat dry with malt and just a touch of hops. Easy to drink.
Outer Banks Altimeter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Dusty amber pour with a minimal white ring. The nose is subdued, with a touch of fruit to the malty-ish nose. This is a lighter, more aerated version of their ESB. It has a light malt front through mid-palates, then the yeast kicks in the finish, supplying a decent sour fruit (but not citrus). This is followed by a light lingering bitter. The mouthfeel is light, and a bit thin for traditional style, but it does feel decently put together and has character. Nothing to write home about, but also nothing to scoff at.
Outer Banks Altimeter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Nice light beer. Dry finish. Very easy to have a few of these. Good for a hot evening like tonight.
Outer Banks Altimeter;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Straw color - a little hazy with a slight fluffy head. Aroma is lightly sweet with a hint of lemon. FLavor is rather dull and somewhat watery. Finish is dry & clean with a slight hop presence at the end. It’s ok, nothing special or distinctive - and may be a little out of style.
Outer Banks Oatmeal Stout;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"On tap at OB Brewing. Tagged ""Naked Lunch Oat Stout 5.8abv"" so I’m putting it here. Dark pour, almost no head. Some lacing. Very little aroma. Lots of roast in this one, and a bit of lactic milkyness. A bit flat on the tongue. Slightly better as it warmed but I regret not choosing a different brew to try."
Outer Banks Oatmeal Stout;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Outer Banks Brewing Station;"Brewed under ""Irish Breakfast Oatmeal Stout"". Opaque pour with a diminishing tan head. Smoky choco coffee aromas. Coffee and cherry flavors, intermixed with dark roasted malt. The finish is of citrusy/dark fruit bitters. Nice smoky-oily mouthfeel and a cherry effervescence. Not my fave of the OBBS line, but definitely a nice offering."
Outer Banks Oatmeal Stout;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Outer Banks Brewing Station;The best beer at the OBX Brewing Station, but I have had much, much better oatmeal stouts - nice coffee-like finish, very dark & rich
Sunnybrook Lager;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);This is also called Ortleib's select 69 lager. A drinkable lager. Light straw colored with a good head, nice hoppiness, and medium malty body. This one won a silver medal in 2003. A good beer if you want more than one.
Sunnybrook Lager;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);Your typical American-style lager, nothing too special to write home about..
Sunnybrook Ale;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);I found my pre-Bill Moore Sunnybrook notes for this one. It poured straw, with aroma of malt, some hop, and some honey. Tastes fairly smooth, but uninspiring. Currently, Bill Moore makes the brews here. He used to work at Sly Fox, among others. I recommend his beers to anyone, especially the vanilla porter, stout, and awesome ale. Now, if he would only whip up a batch of Imperial Stout or Rauchbier!
Sunnybrook Ale;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);This style, just like the rest of Sunnybrook's, would be much, much better if they had a different brewmaster. I believe the plans are in order to get someone new in there. The beers should vastly improve once the existing guy is gone.
Capitol City Abernathy Scotch Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;"(Shirlington, called ""Scotch Ale"") Crystal clear dark copper body with beige head. Aroma is medium sweet, caramel, some cherry, fig. Taste is moderately sweet, caramel, peat, some fig, light syrup, earthy. Medium body, some stickiness."
Capitol City Abernathy Scotch Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;Draft at Shirlington (I assume this is the proper entry location for this beer as the beer was called Scotch Ale). Good Scotch ale, most of the ones I’ve had are pretty overpowering, this one had the right amount of malts and wasn’t overpowering with the alcohol flavors.
Capitol City Abernathy Scotch Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;A very prototypical scotch ale. The alcohol was a little too evident for me, running roughshod over some of the more delicate flavors. A nice mix of woodiness, with earth and peat mixed in. A good beer overall, but not noteworthy.
Capitol City Abernathy Scotch Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;I believe this was the gold medal winner at the 2003 RAF for Scottish styles. A very good malty and complex scottish with smoked malt and caramel notes shining through. A very enjoyable brew on the cask.

Capitol City Abernathy Scotch Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;Dark brown with a slight auburn tint. Alcohol is very noticeable in this one. Plenty of flavors of scotch, peat, and earthiness. Enjoyably complex.
Capitol City Abernathy Scotch Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Capitol City Brewing Company;Think of a fireside on a frosty night - good food and good beer like this one. Rich dark humours, fruity and warm, with hints of berry and maple syrup. The best beer available at the Baltimore Capitol City location.
Sunnybrook Porter;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);Bill Moore has made a vanilla porter for Ortleib's for the past two years or so, since management changed hands. This review is of the vanilla porter. The porter pours very dark, with a creamy, full off white head. Brussels lace forms generously as you drink. The beer is very malty, with a nice vanilla flavor imparted from the malt (the vanilla is subdued and not phony tasting). The beer gives off a great vanilla smell. It is super smooth at the finish, with a final blast of creamy malt and vanilla flavor. Batches of this don't last long when it is on the chalkboard. Delicious.
Sunnybrook Porter;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);This has gotten much better since the ownership has changed hands. ........
Sunnybrook Pilsener;Pottstown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sunnybrook Ballroom (Ortliebs);A good pilsener. Light straw colored, good hoppiness. A little light in texture and color. Medium bodied. This one hasn't been on the board in a while.

Bäre-Bräu Bäre-Alt;Bern, Switzerland;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Bäre-Bräu;reddish-brown colour, beautiful head, impressive floral and caramel aroma, creamy, full and slightly bitter, dry finish - I'm not a great fan of altbier but I found this one pretty good. The brewmaster told me that he still has to learn a lot about this style, that's probably the reason why I liked it ...

Color: beautiful dark red, with good foam, but it quickly settles. Aroma: For lager, very bright, caramel-rye, and a bit of flower-grass hops. Taste: Malt, I would say Bread (Kvass with sour), caramel aftertaste with hops.
Baltika 4 Originalnoe (Original);St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);This one seemed a little tough to review. At first wasn't feelin' this at all, but grew on me somewhat on the 2nd glass. Still a little below par for a dunkel though. On the thinner side, could use a bit more carb. It is what it is. Wouldn't get again, and if this is one of Baltika's better brews, don't think I would care for the others. Could be my first sample from Russia, so the curiosity got me.

Dick's Irish Style Ale;Centralia, Washington, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Dick's Brewing Company;"Rich deep amber coloured body with a light brown glow and a thick, three centimetre tall very soapy and broad bubbled tan head - ugly. Aroma of nuts, earth, copper, metal, water and some light soap - not too pleasant. Light to Medium-bodied; Good malty flavour with some earth and nuts up front fading to an apple, pear, figs, raisins and a little light hoppy flavour. Aftertaste shows mostly fruits with a big malty touch and a light caramel and toffee sweetness at the very end. Overall, a decent beer with some confusing flavours and a good sweetness, but a beer to try if you really like the style, otherwise, a decent offering.

Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);From old tasting notes. Reddish brown liquid topped by a rocky beige head.

Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);10-Apr-14 (12-oz bottle, 2005 release: Obtained in trade with slob, thanks Bert!) I used to drink Blue Ridge all the time when I lived in DC in the 90s, and back then, I thought this beer tasted more like a Barley Wine than a Doppelbock, and here’s this 2005 bottle that’s aged as well as a Barley Wine. The beer pours a hazy, brown body with a thin, tan head that settles to a ring. The nose is obviously focused on deep, rich malt, with toasted bread, milk chocolate, and dried fruits. It’s full bodied without being heavy or cloying and carbonation is light-medium. Overall, this is a very tasty and enjoyable beer, and considering the style, it’s pretty amazing how well this Doppelbock has held together.
Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);2004 bottle. Pours dark brown with a tan head.

Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);"Slightly hazy deep brown coloured body with a super-thin tan head. Aroma of malt, grapes, alcohol, whiskey and some subtle spices. Medium to Full-bodied; Sharp malty taste up front, fading to strong caramel and a nice spiceyness. Aftertaste shows character of spice and malt - a good doppelbock. Overall, definitely worth trying...good for the style. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Chevy Chase Wine & Liquors in Washington, D.C. on 04-July-2005."
Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Feb. 2006 - Wow...what a pleasant surprise! Most of these American attempts at dopplebocks are just too darned sweet...this one could’ve passed for the real deal. Beautiful pour with nice one finger foamy head and lacing. The smell and taste was of rich malts and dark fruits. The flavor was just sweet enough, but NOT OVERPOWERING. Very nicely done. They have to get the word out. My second Blue Ridge beer and they were both very good!

Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);I think I got this in a trade with 1FastSTi. This beer looked like icedtea. Minimal carbonation with fast vanishing tan head. Aroma was of caramel and sweet malt. The taste was the same with nice roasted notes throughtout. Rich, smooth ,and chewy with a mild roasted finish.
Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Bottle, aged 6 months to a year: Pours a clear dark copper mahogany with a nicely-lacing, thin tan head. Nice and authentic, rich dark caramelly sweet German malty aroma has good raisin and plum complexity with a good lager yeast strain. Body starts with a nice viscous maltiness and plenty of carbonation with pleasant toasty bready sweetness and a touch of brown sugar. Sticky finish hides the alcohol very well. Not sure what some of the low ratings are about, but I thought this was a tasty brew and a good example of the style. Maybe my aging it helped some. This makes a very nice dessert beer.
Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Multi brown. Modest, frothy, tan head. Roasty malt, biscuits, caramel/toffee, banana, clove like spice, subtle dark fruits, and a splash of a bourbon like flavor. Medium/full palate, smooth. Very nice doppelbock.
Blue Ridge (MD) Subliminator;Easton, Maryland, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Poured a copper brown color with a very nice initial head, but weak lacing. I want more depth of color out of my doppelbocks. The aroma was doughy and spicey, almost smelled like a maibock. The flavor was of some caramel, dough, spices, light grass, and maybe some nuts. I wanted more dark fruit flavors at least in the background. Mouthfeel was only moderate for the style (ie. kinda light). A nice beer, but not an outstanding doppelbock. A little bit of a let down after some good success on other Frederick beers.

Rock Bottom Pumpkin Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Other;CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries -Rock Bottom Corporate Office;On tap at Rock Bottom in Bethesda, MD, where it was listed as 7.8% ABV and 15 IBUs. Clear, dark reddish-amber with a thin khaki head and fine lacing that coats the glass but does not linger. Aroma of toffee, nutmeg, pumpkin, allspice, cinnamon, cloves and candied yams. Taste of cloves, allspice, nutmeg, chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, pumpkin, and alcohol. Medium/full body and medium carbonation. Remarkably complex for a Rock Bottom brew. Moreover, a pretty decent ale underlies all those spices. It's intense enough that you might not want to drink more than one, but certainly worth trying. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Very yeasty, tastes rather like a dunkel type beer. Slightly sweet, but not very, not a really heavy flavor, light in body. Close to a dunkel but not as much roasted flavor. Decent amount of hops but not a lot. Very light. O.k.
Carlsberg Carls Påske;Copenhagen, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Carlsberg Brewery;Bottle (Best before 2009). Medium head with medium duration. Color is amber. Aroma and taste are malt, caramel and hops.

Carlsberg Carls Påske;Copenhagen, Denmark;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Carlsberg Brewery;Fredagsbaren på Biologi, Aarhus, DK. Bottled. A tone of caramel but mostly too alcoholic to other imperessions
North Coast Wintertime Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Flavored - Other;North Coast Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Deep reddish brown color. Foamy tan head. Spicy roasted malt aroma. Rich toasted malt flavor with hints of toffee and cocoa. There is an abundance of hops that come through early and lasts throgh to the finish. Good flavor and body contribute to a tasty dark ale.

North Coast Wintertime Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Flavored - Other;North Coast Brewing Company;12/26/14. On tap at RIBCO. Amber pour with a small khaki head, mild lacing. Spiced aroma, Christmas spices and the like, bready, malty, doughy. The flavor is basically the same, a dose of spices, malty, bready, a little yeasty, doughy. Not bad.
North Coast Wintertime Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Flavored - Other;North Coast Brewing Company;Bottle. Amber pour with a smaller head. Malty and spice. Not all that pleasant. Not interested in finishing this.
North Coast Wintertime Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Flavored - Other;North Coast Brewing Company;On tap. Copper color with one finger off white head. Malt and spice aroma. Taste is more malty. Nothing special.
North Coast Wintertime Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Flavored - Other;North Coast Brewing Company;(bottle) Pours a copper-red color with a thin off-white head that recedes quickly. Aroma holds a strong note of toasted malt, some chocolate undertones, and a scent reminiscent of a spiced date bar. Flavor is full of the toasted malt, with a semi-sweet and spicy component that turns really dry and somewhat off-putting on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is fizzy. Overall a pretty nondescript beer that was pleasant enough to drink.
North Coast Wintertime Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Flavored - Other;North Coast Brewing Company;This was a pretty regular winter beer. A bit of spice, some malts, caramel. Not too crazy.
North Coast Wintertime Ale;Fort Bragg, California, United States;Flavored - Other;North Coast Brewing Company;Draught pint. Appearance is hazy orange color with medium, off-white head.

Three Needs Belgian Trippel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Tripel;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;A hazy golden ale with a thin white head. A very pleasant arom of bananas and strawberries, cloves, like a hyper wit. In mouth, a rich and onctuous triple with cloves and bananas, and nice frutiy esters. Rich and spiced! On tap at brewpub Oct. 10 2008.
Three Needs Belgian Trippel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Tripel;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Clear golden ale wearing a small white froth. The aroma immediately takes you to the major leagues of the usually uninteresting brewpub tripels. Fully perfumey, abundantly aromatic. Soft and honeyed, sugary, yet floral and grainy enough to feel fresh anyway. Excellent fresh fruit notions all around. Pear and peaches-like while its hops procure excellent mandarine and flower notes. Complex fruity yeast effects, yet feeling authentic. The big-bubbled carbonation has this expanding belgian character. Full-bodied, its sweetness manages to be all about fruits and never about syrup. Daring and successful.
Three Needs Belgian Trippel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Tripel;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Sampled a 1.5 year old bottle at the brewpub in mid-February: Pours a transparent copper orange with a nicely-lacing frothy white head. Sweet caramel and honey with some bready Belgian yeast dominate the aroma. Body starts with a sweet sticky toffee caramel maltiness and some orange citrus well-balanced with an authentic bready Belgian yeastiness and a touch of black pepper. Seems to have aged well.
Three Needs Belgian Trippel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Tripel;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"On tap at the brewery. Probably Three Needs' finest offering, the Tripel is properly served in a large wine glass, at close to cellar temp. Nice straw-colored fizzy body, and an aroma that offers faint peaches among the more usual citrusy smells. Light and crisp despite its undoubted high ABV, it goes down easily and is well-balanced between the grapefruity hop bitterness and a thicker, ambrosial malt presence. Very nice going down; not great, but a sign that this brewer has potential--if only they would stick to Belgians and stop their overreaching German and especially American-style experiments. 3/2/02 rerate. Even better 2nd time around; appearance is gorgeous with an impossibly thick persistent head and great amber cloudy color; flavor is immense, buttery-lemony-creamy-caramel-malty -- everything you'd expect in a Trippel. Too bad this is one of the last batch from the former brewer's stock..."
Three Needs Belgian Dubbel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Poured into a pint glass, the appearance was a dark red/brown color. Thin white cap of a head. Stringy lace. The aroma takes in a mild amount of earthy to rustic Belgian spices coating a fair amount of bready/yeasty flavors. Some sweet cake. Light milk chocolate. Some vinous quality as it warms. The flavor leans mildly sweet through the cake and bready/yeasty aromas. Belgian spices try to make an effort to balance with an eleoquent use of that dry vinous quality. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body. That vinous quality seems to punch a little bit of boozy sting to my tongue. But then the bready/yeasty to cake sticky clingy-ness allows somewhat of a balance. Overall, weird dubbel, if anything, it’s alright for what it is.
Three Needs Belgian Dubbel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;On tap at Three Needs. Pours reddiesh brown with a thin but persistent tan head. Smells fruitty with lots of spices. Tastes of coffee, fruits, spices and sugar.
Three Needs Belgian Dubbel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;Pours a dark and rich brown color with a thick, light tan and well-lacing head. Sweet caramely Belgian malt aroma. Body is thick, sweet, bready and complex, with a somewhat tart finish. A very nice dubbel, but could use a little more balance and yeastiness.
Three Needs Belgian Dubbel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"Strong, strong flavor; alcohol, a nice yeastiness and vinous quality; but way too much carbonation. Beautiful light amber color, and typically complex Belgian nose; but guys, cut down on the fizz! 2/4 rerate. Liked this a bit more; seemed smoother, less fizzy, and thicker-bodied. If you hit this pub, definitely go with the Belgians and the Porter."
Three Needs English Mild;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Mild Ale;Three Needs Brewery & Taproom;"This is a hard one to rate, as it is the first in this style that I've had, and I had something of a cold. I'll have to try it again when I'm feeling better, as the first effort wasn't much. I know these aren't supposed to have any hops, but what this example lacked was MALT. The best way to describe it would be, very bitter but very smooth. Super-clean finish; no body, no maltiness, absolutely no sweetness at all, the least-sweet beer I think I've ever had. Different, for sure."

Ochakovo Spetsialnoe (Special);Moscow, Russia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ochakovo;Bottle shared with McTapps. Pours in golden to yellow with medium head. No real aroma, but malt is dominating. But sweetish and simple in the taste. Nothing special but it won’t hurt you to drink one.

Arsenalnoe Temnoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Bottled. Ruby coloured. Medium bodied. Malt accented and clean. One of the better Russian dark lagers.
Arsenalnoe Temnoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Baltika Brewery (Baltic Beverages Holding - Carlsberg);Some chewy malt flavour. As a general rule, dark lagers in Russia are worse than the pale ones, and this is no exception. The only dunkel in St Petersburg worth drinking is Afanasiy.
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Gold in color with bright white head. Big sweet malty nose, flavor much the same with hints of hops on the finish. Thanks to a friend for this. It took me a while to figure out just what beer it was.
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Light golden in color with a small white lacing,large loose bubbles that quickly disapate.

Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Pours milky gold with white head. I expected to be let down categorically with this one and was pleasantly surprised. Pleasant floral aroma, palate like a smooth pilsner, and finishes with a belgian yeast taste. I will try this again for sure. (bottled)
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Bottle: Clear light orange with a thin large-bubbled white head. Rich sweet malts in the aroma with a hint of pumpkin pie (?). Soft carbonation, full bodied, starts and ends slightly sweet.
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Large, white rocky head. Reduces nicely and leaves a good amount of lacing. Good carbonation. Light malty aroma with a bit of tangy hops. Color is a medium gold. Flavor is metallic at first then mellows out. Nice malt backbone with a decent amount of hops and bitterness. Slight butter flavor at is warms. Bit of roastyness also. Finish is smooth and clean with a decent amount of bitterness. A good vienna style with a nice hops kick.
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);"5.6%. Bottle sampled in Sankt Peterburg. Former name ""Dvoynoe Zolotoe"" - Double Golden. Amazing amber colour and medium white head. Poor lacing. Fruity and malty aroma, INTENSE malty palate. Very full bodied beer and a choice for long winter nights..."
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);i must be drunk because i like this better than most of the people here. assertive maltiness, somehow. and it finishes all smokey. what more can i say? im buzzed off my ass and i gotta pee really bad. try it.. come on... try THE BEER!!! do it!!!
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Nice golden color,small head that faded fast.The aroma was light malt and possibly mild fruit with a mild hop presence.The taste was nothing real special,malty with a slight hop character and maybe some fruit but i think i'm reaching on that one.It's like most other russkie brews in this style with little to offer on flavor or imagination.
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);"Crystal clear golden colour with a thin white head. Aroma of pale malt, faint hops and a metallic twang. Light to Medium-bodied; Malty flavour with some sweetness and a faint english/german hop taste. Afteraste mild, but left a bit better off than most. This is not a Vienna, and in my opinion an European Strong Lager. However you want to look at it, the beer is decent, and worthy to try. I bought this 500 mL bottle at Beers of the World in Rochester, New York."
Stepan Razin Zolotoye;St. Petersburg, Russia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Stepan Razin Brewery (Heineken);Pale malt aroma, ale-y, like a cross between a lager and a bitter. Orangey marzen beer. Medium sweetness, initially seemed tinny and bitter but that faded and i got into it. Fruity red lager tartness. Tart tin and a little stale in the finish.

Strömsfors Svagdricka;Oskarström, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Strömsfors Bryggeri;Nice people at the brewery. They even gave me a bottle of beer to taste it at home. But this kind of beer is not my kind. The aroma is very bad, like unfermented sugar and malt. Dark coloured brown almost black and clouded. Very very sweet. Very full like drinking bread. I think no hops were used.
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;Bottle @ home. Blond colour, white foam. Very yeasty, notes of banana, some citrus. Not very well balanced.
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;Barwa jasno cytrynowa, słomkowa z delikatnym zmętnieniem. Biała, gęsta piana, całkiem wysoka i nawet trwała. Redukuje się do cienkiej warstewki. W aromacie drożdże, owoce, nuty wiejskie, trochę akcentów słodkich zbliżonych do banana, kolendra. Smak podobnie jak aromat drożdżowy, z nutami owocowymi (cytryna, banan), kolendra z odrobiną pieprzu. Piwo jest delikatne, może trochę chude ale bardzo wyraziste. Nasycenie wysokie w kierunku do średniego, sprawdza się idealnie.
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;Pours unclear yellow, like a white beer. Small white head. Smell is bit spiced, rather sweet. Taste is sharp, bitter, lemon fruityness, or more juicyness, as it is really lemonade-like. More ’beer-ish’ than radler, but mostly because it is yeasty on top of the lemon characters. Fairly bitter,dry ending, trough it’s sweeteners. Not great... Not great at all.
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;"Pours clear yellow with a small, thinning, white head. The aroma contains yeast, citrus, spices, wheat and soap. It tastes light wheaty sour and light grainy bitter; dry, metallic finish, soapy. Light body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation. Really quite bad. (Edited 20/5/18)"
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;Somehow I had expectations for this. Beers with such a label are typically old time classics with character (or a blatant rip-off). And while the yeast had some style to it, overall it’s a straightforward Belgian blond as any other. I enjoyed drinking it, but craved for more in the end. (25cl bottle from ABS Drinks)
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;small bottle. Pours clear pale wheat-ish yellow.Finely bubbled. Gentle spice aroma (cloves and cardemom), very light body with quite a bite of the yeast and a very agreeable malt finish and aftertaste. Nice beer overall.
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;25cl bottle. Very vividly, hazy-golden beer with lots of carbon. Very malty, yeasty ale, with a rather strong body for a 5.4 percent alcohol beer.
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;Bottle @ Brasserie Strijdershuis, Brugge. Hazy yellow-blonde colour with a very thin head. Identifiably Belgian in style but with a large carbonation which affects its taste and mouthfeel. It’s active in the palate and not better for it. There’s some sour citrus involved here but it is light.
Pee Klak;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;Another Hoegaarden clone, but more ’honest’ and refreshing than its ancestor, with a dryingly sourish finish. Not bad for the style. Originally from Crombé.

Burton Bridge Thomas Sykes;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Old Ale;Burton Bridge Brewery;From old notes. Cask @ Peterborough Beer Fest 2000. Last one of the day. Copper brown colour. Strong alcoholic, old ale-ish, estery, not much bitterness. A worthy beer to conclude this rather alcoholic day...
Burton Bridge Thomas Sykes;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Old Ale;Burton Bridge Brewery;Gravity cask at the 2018 Bedford Beer Festival. Toffee golden in colour with a loose white head. Sweet toffee, brown sugar, freshly baked bread, a bit of banana to breathe in and about. Sweet and just the right side of sickly. We often use 'toffee to describe a basic brown malty bitter, but this is really toffee, like sucking on a booze-laden Werthers Original. Having said that it hides the alcohol really well. Vegetal note on the finish which brings it down a bit. The body is thinner than most strong beers but it's by no means watery. Oily texture and flat carbonation. Really enjoyable. Yum.

Burton Bridge Thomas Sykes;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Old Ale;Burton Bridge Brewery;Pendle Beer Festival 2016. Golden-amber coloured. Extremely strong and spirit-like, with a dire taste - I was not the only person at the festival to feel this way about it, but given the decent reviews on RB it may not have travelled too well to the festival.
Burton Bridge Thomas Sykes;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Old Ale;Burton Bridge Brewery;Gravity cask. Hazy orange, still, small bubbly white head. Aroma is sickly under-ripe orange, satsuma, banana skin. Body is light, smooth, low carbonation. Taste is sugar syrup, banana skin, gravy, caramel. Musty sweetness. Alcohol coming through noticeably. It’s OK - very slow drinking. A beer this big can get away with being over-sweet.

Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;Bottle in pint glass from The Drinkery, Londonderry, NH. Aroma is bready, caramel, roasted cereal malt with a bit of fruit, yeasty dough and barnyard. Appearance is cloudy (lots of sediment floaters) brownish red with minimal beige head that dissipates fairly quickly and trace lacing. Taste is light-to-medium sweet up front and in the middle with some dry sour at the finish. Palate is light-to-medium bodied with average texture and lively carbonation. Overall, pleasant and highly drinkable but isn’t noteworthy in any way.
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;Bottle. Dark clear copper with lasting head and lace. Mild caramel and fruit and slightly metallic aroma, Sweet caramel fruity with medium spicy bitterness. Not really picking up much smoke. Will let it warm up a little... More roasty sweetness. Would be excellent with significant smoke. Medium body. Fairly aggressive carbo. Good.
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;Bottle. Malty toasted flavor with a sort of odd aftertaste that I couldn’t place. Ok but not great
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;I poured a 12oz bottle into a mug. It has a best by date of 3/8/14 and cost $2.70 ($0.23 per ounce). Appearance: Clear, bright shade of copper/burgundy. Pours to an average size, white, foamy head which mostly dissipates and leaves minor lacing on the glass. Smell: General malty aroma with hints of the usual scents for the style. Smells more like an Oktoberfest than a true Scotch Ale. Taste: Scotch Ales are, in my opinion, an acquired taste. They’re very rich in character, has a smoky/peaty astringency and tend to be big in body. Wachusett Winter Ale has those qualities, but with less intensity. It’s remarkably drinker-friendly, making it a good introductory beer for those unfamiliar with the style. The palette starts out with a nice malty flavor, similar to that of an Oktoberfest with distinct toffee and caramel flavors but without any lager character at all (as well it shouldn’t since it’s an ale). Slightly dry bitterness at the crest of the swig with subtle notes of chocolate and peat moss on the finish. There’s a slight tang or astringency on the back end, though I wouldn’t considering it a distraction per se. Hints of butterscotch on the aftertaste, at least momentarily. Drinkability: While Wachusett Winter Ale may not be the best Scotch Ale ever, it’s in contention of the smoothest and most drinkable of the style I’ve ever had. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick, but soft with a smooth texture and easy finish. This would be an ideal accompaniment with cheese, or as an after-dinner beverage or nightcap. Though at only 6.1% ABV it’s not that heavy of a beer, but not light enough to consider sessioning. A single serving is satisfying.
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;Sampled at Mass Brewers Fest @ Julio’s. Poured a clear red/amber with a small, dense off white head. Sweet caramel nose with just a hint of smoke. Fairly sweet taste with more caramel malt and some nuttiness. Some spices. Sweet, but not overly so. Full bodied and warming.
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;Temple w/ new people. Fairly boring beer in a fairly odd bar. Nothing to go looking for.
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;It pours a light amber in color and has some visible carbonation seen rising in my nonic. A nice fluffy one inch white foamy head appears and lasts for about a minute before slowly dieing. The smell has some light aromas of caramel with some light spice as well. The taste is slightly sweet ranging closer to some light bitterness from the Christmas spices. The palate is medium centering on a moderate amount of carbonation on the tongue. This is fairly drinkable. It leaves a bland aftertaste. Overall, I’m not really impressed with this one, but for the style, I’d say just average.
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;Not much going on in this winter ale. I have a few others I would buy again before this one. Not enough going on in this beer to comment specifically. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;"A smooth malty nose with a hint of smoke. Medium amber color - when one pictures strong English beer this isn’t it. Could be a bitter or even a pale. Tastes, however, are the roasted malt and bitter bankground that define the style. Not enough sweetness to be Scotch ale; English classification is correct. An easy enough drinking beer with a medium body. Just out of the session range."
Wachusett Winter Ale;Westminster, Massachusetts, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Wachusett Brewing Company;Malty sweet. Thick and heavy with a lot of flavor. I wish it had even more alcohol to match the rich taste. Would be great with very sharp pungent cheeses or savory meats.

Pours a nice deep gold with a perfect 2 inch head that leaves perfect lacing. This is a beautiful beer. Smells of honey-kissed biscuits, and floral hops. This beer smells very inviting. The hop taste washes over the palate and leaves a nice quick bite on the tongue. Perfectly hopped. The malt backbone balances this out quite nicely. This brew has the perfect amount of carbonation and feel. Smooth yet crisp. I could drink a few of these. I am really impressed by this ""local"" beer! I had never heard of these guys, but I will seek them out again for sure."

Pours a light orange with small white head that dissapates quickly. Aroma is spicy pine, nice carbonation, good lacing. Taste is grainy malt and spicy (piney) herbal hops and finishes a little dry. Too much hop flavor to be an English Pale Ale should be American Pale Ale.
Starr Hill Throwback Pale Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Starr Hill Brewery;"Enjoyed on tap in a large hexagonal glass. The beer pours a medium amber color, with an average sized head. Aromas of citrus and slight pine come through in the nose, as does the Munich malt advertised in the beer’s description; the latter disguising itself quite effectively as medium English crystal malt. Carbonation is high for the English variant of pale ale, although this may be more a result of the restaurant’s tap system than the brewer’s intention. The palate is assertively, but not overly bitter, again showing a bit more of a tendency toward APA than EPA. The Munich malt makes its presence known in the mid-palate, before fading a bit to allow for a more balanced ending note. Said finish lingers for a moment, seems generally clean. Overall, not a beer that is going to change lives, but a solid effort."
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;This being the 3rd Starr Hill that I sampled (first two were Northern Lights and Love), I will finally say that I found a brew by them that I would buy again. Tried the first two at a festival so were poured on tap catered to mass crowd (two negatives). This one I am in the comfort of my own home, poured in a glass on a chilly under 40 degree Florida winter night. Has a black appearance with aromas of coffee and slight hops. Not much lacing as it's a thin beer. Flavor is chocolate malts and coffee, decent hop finish too. Recently tried Sierra Neveda Stout which was better, but this is similar in a lot of ways....more coffee though. After this, I will give Starr Hill another chance.
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;bottle @ Beer Run / Charlottesville VA --- Opaque black color, tan head cover, stripes of lace. Taste is lightly toasted malt that grows into a mildly carbonated swallow, adding just enough hops in the finish to keep things well balanced. This is what a standard stout (think: Guinness, Murhpy’s, Marston’s, etc) should taste like - bursting with flavor, low abv, solid all-around.
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;Delicious brew although quite watery for a proper stout. Pour is light black and a thin head.
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;"Aroma is toasted barley. Smoke. Appearance; dark black,no head. Thinnish. Taste; hops, ash, barley. Feel is thin, Low carb. Nothing special."
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;Not a terrible beer, just very low on aroma. Not particularly dry either. Pours black with foamy mocha head and decent lacing. Very light roast. Life bitter finish with a little booze. Bottle.
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;Not bad from star hill. Dark pour. Thin tan head. Chocolate coffee with bitter hop pallet. Ends dry. Not quite as smooth as a true Guinness. More like a low abv black ipa.
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;Bottle from a box into a snifter. Pour is brown to black with a small off white to light tan head. Nose is a lightly tart coffee and roast. Taste is like watered down burnt coffee with no mouthfeel whatsoever. Thin, blah, meh.
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;Keg @ Starr Hill. Brown with a small head. Pepper, brown sugar, dark chocolate. Taste is similar. Roasted coffee. Abrasive bitterness. Cream. Not quite in sync. Medium body, moderate carbonation.
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;Bottle, twist-off top, marked 09/08/13. Nose is a little dank and musty, chocolate and some roast, sweet and airy. Pours ruby-edged black with a huge airy brown head, slow-going for sure. Flattish body despite the over-carbonation, lightly sweet and far from cloying, some lactose-like milkiness and cola-like acidity and sharpness. Light body but not watery, mostly forgettable.
Starr Hill Dark Starr Stout;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Starr Hill Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 10-20-12- Poured from bottle in to pint glass Appearance – Pours a deep brown nearly black color with a one finger tan head. The head fades fast to give a moderate amount of lacing. Smell – The aroma is heaviest of roasted malt, coffee and some light toffee aromas. Taste – The taste starts out roasty and malty with some caramel flavors. These flavors remain constant throughout the taste. Some toffee flavors combined with the roasted flavors of the start and sweeten the brew more in the middle. As the taste advances further some coffee flavors come to the tongue and add some bitterness to the tongue. In the end, while still sweet there is a slightly bitter flavor left lingering on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the lighter side with a carbonation level that is rather average. A thicker body would have been slightly better for the roasted flavors, but for a 4.2 % I guess you can’t expect anything too thick. Overall – A decent light stout, but nothing that is really all that fantastic. It is sort of a sweet version of Guinness draught without the nitro. If looking for a low alcohol stout, would take a Guinness over this.
Starr Hill Christmas Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Strong Ale - English;Starr Hill Brewery;"Rich, with a nice mouthfeel that warms the tongue. No spices or too much sweetness to ruin things; just a lot of chocolate malt and hops. Rich. Balanced. Flavorful. Puts a smile on your face."

Starr Hill Amber Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Starr Hill Brewery;Decent amber ale, consumed in north carolina, bottle from Kroger, easy to drink ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Starr Hill Amber Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Starr Hill Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy burnt red to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light lacing sticking and then sliding into the beer. The smell had a nice roasty to burnt semi - sweet caramel dirty earthiness to it. The taste pretty much did the same thing leaving a rolling burnt shredded caramel malt - leaves that toasty effect in the aftertaste to impart on the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly okay sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat subdued to allow a rolling subtle smoothness to it. Overall, this one was an okay red ale. It’s not necessarily one that I would seek again.
Starr Hill Amber Ale;Crozet, Virginia, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Starr Hill Brewery;Rated on 3-29-2011 (Bottle purchased at Total Wine & More-Ft. Myers, FL) The appearance is a small fizzy ivory head that mostly diminishes, reddish body and very little carbonation observed. The aroma is caramel malt, lightly hoppy and fruity. The flavor is caramel malt and fruity. The mouthfeel is soft carbonation and this beer is light-medium bodied. Overall, this beer lacks character and no WOW factor. The flavor is boring and bland.

Flying Dog In-Heat Wheat Hefeweizen;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Flying Dog Brewery;Old rating. Used to be a regular in my rotation. Kind of precursor to Blue Moon in Denver. But a still real deal Hefe with some wheatness and yeast and bit of citrus bite.
Flying Dog In-Heat Wheat Hefeweizen;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Flying Dog Brewery;From Dec 2007 I got this bottle in a trade with JDV. Thanks Deniz! This pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy yellow-orange with a 2 finger head of foam and it has some lacing. The foam lasted for the entire session, which I liked. The smell has notes of wheat, yeast, clove, and some citrus. The taste has a good wheat flavour along with fairly strong clove and banana and a mild citrus bite in the background. Quite refreshing and a good example of the style. It has a light mouthfeel and medium high carbonation and it finishes with some clove and some citrus. Good stuff. Thanks again, Deniz!

Great Lakes Loch Erie Scotch Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Dark reddish brown. No head. The nose is almost nonexistent.

Great Lakes Loch Erie Scotch Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Draft at GLB. In hand as I type this. Hazy amber color without head. Aroma is nice, toasted bread, caramlised malt, dried leaves. Flavor is right in line, medium body with a huge caramel, burnt sugar and light alcoholic finish. Nice easy sipper.
Great Lakes Loch Erie Scotch Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Glass at GLBC on 10/11/13. Clear reddish copper in color with a thick tan head.

Great Lakes Loch Erie Scotch Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);"Draft at Dutch’s February ’13. Pours a hazy dark golden brown color with a small off white head. The aroma is malty in a light caramel, lightly toasted sort of way. It’s actually pretty weak. The flavor is much of the same; nothing bad, just not much going on. Bland, lightly toasted, caramel with a splash of fruit. I definitely expect more from this brewery."

Carmel colored pour, malty and flavorful balanced out with a little bitterness from the hop. A great level of gravity, adds a bit of bitter warmth to the tongue and nose. A nice brew, definitely worth seeking.

Mort Subite Oude Gueuze (formerly: Fond);Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Amber, slightly hazy with an off-white head that dilapidates quickly. Mild muggy aroma. Sour taste, but not too much, leaving it to be one of the rather mild examples. Very drinkable.
Mort Subite Oude Gueuze (formerly: Fond);Kobbegem, Belgium;Lambic - Gueuze;Mort Subite (Alken-Maes - Heineken);Best before 2028. Pours honey gold with thin layer of head. Funky, wood, apple cider vinegar aroma. Tart, citrus flavor, mild fruity character and at times watery. Wood barrel, tart lemony finish. Sometimes like a dry white wine. Really nice geuzue which I think might be more accessible to someone who isn't familiar with blended lambics due to it's lower intensity. I like it.

Drawing of what I suppose is the brewery, some barrels and happy guy with a horn on a Horse. They even manage to brag about a ""Best Sour Beer Award"" from 2014. Pours hazy, golden yellow with a medium-sized white head. Settles as small chunks of foam clinging to the side of the glass. Moderate lacing. Aroma is sharp and citric. Vinegar, citrus, green apples with very light funky hints. Acidic. Light but prickly carbonation. Soft yet tingling texture. Flavor is medium sweet followed by a strong sourness. Aftertaste is siur citric and linger for a bit. Finish is dry. Solid Lambic. Crisp, sour and dry. With only a moderate hint of funk. Fair enough they got a award for this sour fellow."

King and Barnes Broadwood Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King and Barnes;Not a bad ale. Dark brown color, somewhat cloudly. Light head. Aroma of malt and English hops. Some bitterness on the finish, but really a classic English Ale(except the color which I thought was a little to dark).
King and Barnes Broadwood Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King and Barnes;Not the most enjoyable aroma, but this beer surprised me after I tasted it. A thick toffee, almost chocolate malt flavor in this pale ale with a bitter but balanced finish. I liked it.
Storm Hurricane IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);I don't think this should be rolled into the Hurricane IPA as Storm is labelling it as a separate brew of theirs, the 100% James IPA on tap at their brewery. Growler fill for me. Pours with a nice bit of foam and heavily carbonated yellow body. Smells of musty hops with some vegetable, cabbage, orange zest. Flavour is sharp hops followed by some mellow malts. Mouthfeel is balanced between oil and other stuff so it's okay there. Not a bad IPA, typical as it is which is surprising given Storm's usual repertoire of bizarre concoctions.
Storm Hurricane IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Stopped at the brewery over summer and just getting a chance to log some of them.

Storm Hurricane IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);On tap at Craft Beer Market in Vancouver. A nice golden, slightly reddish colour, with ample pale head, fast collapsing. A bit of citrus hop nose. Hm. A well hopped, but not super hopped IPA, with good malt balance. Slightly bitter, mostly malted medium length finish. Some aftertaste. Nice and easy drinking, but unremarkable for a west coast IPA. 3.3.
Storm Hurricane IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Draft, pours golden orange with a thin white head. Very citrus aroma, orange and grapefruit. Flavour is similar, very citrus and well hopped. Nice full bodied beer.
Storm Hurricane IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Couleur ambré/jaune avec une mousse blanc moyenne. L’arôme est très fruitée. Plein d’agrumes. Je dirais plutôt du pamplemousse que du citron, mais il y a un peu de ça aussi avec un très peu du pin. Facile à boire. Un amertume moyenne, mais c’est assez facile à boire que tu pourrais la boire toute la soirée.

Storm Highland Scottish Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Scottish Ale;Storm Brewing (BC);Ambrée pale avec un col moyenne beige. L’arôme du malt et un très peu du caramel. Le goût est du malt avec un peu de caramel avec une finition amer, mais un peu amer pour le style, selon moi. Si je ne savais pas que c’était une bière du style écossais j’aurais la peine à y croire. Assez bonne, mais pas forte pour le style
Storm Raspberry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);On tap at 12 Kings, pours a deep dark red with a small beige head. Aroma brings out barnyard funk upfront, with balsamic and a touch of tart raspberries. Flavour is nothing like an authentic lambic, with a spicy yeast profile, along with balsamic and somewhat funky raspberries. It’s a decent sour, but leaves much to be desired. Okay.
Storm Raspberry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);Don't think this is retired as I just filled up a growler with it this afternoon from there. Pours with okay pink head on top of a darker pink body with strong carbonation. Aroma is that of fruit beer, lots of sweet fruitiness with a bit of yeasty tartness. Flavour is vegetably raspberries, muddy and not sweet, with sour hints. Wet finish. Not as sweet as I was expecting and seems to lack freshness.
Storm Raspberry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);(Druaght) Sampled at the brewery --- thanks James! Pours a headless ruby body. Nose and flavours are of tart raspberry and sour cherries. Hard to drink a full pint but damn nice in moderation.
Storm Raspberry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);Was made in 1997 and they slowly sell the stuff. Once this is gone they have a black current lambic which they haven't even started on yet!! Very subtle hint of cherries underlay a sour ass beer. Damn this beer will have you puckering for a week!!
Storm Raspberry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);More effervescent and drier than the Kriek, with a cleaner taste (none of those brutal Wyeast fake-lambic notes). Still more Lindeman's than Cantillon, but this is a very pleasant springtime refresher.
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);On tap at Alibi’s 300. Pours a dark clear copper with a tiny ring of head. Aroma of Worcestershire sauce, soured dark fruits and funk. Flavour the same butwith easier distinguishable fruits such as plum, red berries, and apples. Exceptionally dry, mouth watering. Nice flavours.
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);"Draught at the Alibi Room, Vancouver, as Storm James’ Insane 14 year aged Lambic Hazy amber color; nice head. Pungent aroma, with some acetone, but also nice fruits, berries, candies. The flavor is extremely sour, but this one, compared to other Storm’s Lambics, seems to have more fruits, and also some residual sweetness; unfortunately again there is some acetone; there is some roasted ham flavor too (strange, uh?), and a nutty trace in the end. Extreme but interesting."
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);"Draught as ""Storm James’ Insane 14 year aged Lambic""@The Alibi Room, Vancouver Deep amber color, small steady off-white head. Medium-bodied. Tart fruity aroma. Flavor - wow, this is SOUR - I mean extremely sour and then fruity too. Leaves also salty aftertaste. Huh, did I mention that this is sour?"
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);Nose is tart and full of funky sour notes, tart cherries, some vinnagrette, wood. Really tart smelling, somewhat winey as well. Pours dark reddish, thin head that turns to a ring. Red hues. Nice looking beer. Super sour up front, cherries underneath, tart, fruit, wood, vinegar, funky sour notes, lingering sour. Really a super sour beer with solid fruity undertones. Second time I’ve had one of their lambics - fuck yes good shit.
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);Draught @ The Alibi Room, Vancouver, BC Note: Tap list says James’ Insane 14 Year Lambic - Pours orange with a small smooth head. Tastes more like a gueuze than a fruit lambic. Aroma has hints of sourness, berries and yeast. Taste is very sour with notes of cherry and berries. Smooth finish, which balances out the sourness quite nicely. Not as dry as the Belgian gueuzes. Great take on a classic style.
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);Aged 13 years according to the menu at Alibi room. Very very sour lambic, but a good experience to try one with this much age to see how it holds out. I’m already not a huge lambic fan, so I tried to be fair in my assessment. I actually had two considering the rare experience. I definitely enjoyed it, but I’m not great in describing tastes. It was a reddish amber colour with little to no head. Fruity in aroma.
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);Pint, split with McBerko, at Alibi Room’s 200th list, Vancouver. Pours a reddish tinged brown with minimal head. Aroma is woody, sour and brandied fruit. Taste is sour but nowhere near as sour as I would have expected. This turned out to be a good thing as it didn’t overwhelm the more subtle woody and aged fruit notes that gave this beer such complexity. Admittedly I am not a fan of super sour beers but this really struck exactly the right balance. Aged and boozy cherries lingered in the finish. Delicious...if a little too boozy. Earlier Rating: 10/1/2010 Total Score: 4.1 sampled at the Alibi Room in Vancouver. A 12 year aged forgotten batch of this exceptional lambic. Pours a hazy ruby tinged brown with little head. Aroma is dusty and pungent with sour cherry. Taste is lush with mouth puckering sourness, deep and complex sour cherry, hint of yeast. Finish is long and pleasing. No question this is one of the best beers of this style I have ever had. Get some while it lasts...if you can. AND an exceptional value at $7.50 for 355ml at Alibi.
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);On tap at The Alibi Room’s 200th beer menu event, split with manuchampions, pours a murky reddish brown.

Flavour is more dynamic and unusual than the aroma suggests - wood, oak, slight bourbon, sweet fruits underneath and of course a sharp tartness (though no where near the tartness of the 12-year aged lambic by Storm). Glad I only had half a glass of this due to its sourness. Very interesting concoction. Earlier Rating: 6/24/2010 Total Score: 3.8 On tap at the Alibi Room, pours reddish brown. Overwhelming sour fruit aroma. Flavour is intense! -sourness to the max, cherries, sharp tartness with a long lingering sour finish. A unique one for sure.
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);On tap at the Alibi Room. Decided to try this one out and wow, quite a different beer from what I am normally used to. Poured a deep red colour. Smelled like vinegar with a hint of fruit, of what type I am not quite sure. It had an extremely sour taste that was actually very enjoyable. Overall, I did enjoy this beer and its originality (to me), although it was quite difficult at first to get in to.
Storm Black Cherry Lambic;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Lambic - Fruited;Storm Brewing (BC);on tap at the Alibi Room in Vancouver. Pours dark with an off-white head. Nose is of sour cherries. Taste is of sour fruit, but has some other kinda funky flavor that I can’t put a finger on. Hmmm. Mouthfeel is dry and very sour.
Aubel Apple Ale;Aubel, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Aubel;"(Bottle 33 cl) Comes as ""Biere d’Aubel"". Aubel is apparently situated in the midst of Belgiums apple growing district, hence a natural - if somewhat unusual - ingredient here. Pale golden with a small white head. Wonderful fresh, fruity and very refined nose. Extremely complex and refined flavours on a dry, pleasant background. Dunno what I had expected, but this comes as a pleasant surprise. 100399"

Aubel Apple Ale;Aubel, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Aubel;Not much of a fan of cider, I thought I would hate this (even though this is not a cider). Much to my surprise and delight, I found this to be quite delicious. Extremely smooth with a strong apple cider nose. Medium-bodied, with a fairly complex taste consisting of banana, toasted coconut, and nut undertones and a stronger apple flavor, with a roasty, malty character. Mild sweetness on par with a hefeweizen. Yummy!
Aubel Apple Ale;Aubel, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Aubel;At first I was expecting this to be cider-like. I was very surprised to find out that the apple flavor, while prevalent, was very subtle and smooth. It is less sweet and much better than cider, and I love cider.
Pyramid Oatmeal Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Transfer from BA review on 12-4-13- Poured from a bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown, nearly black color with a one finger of a cream colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a great level of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is a nice blend of roasted malt, oatmeal, and some sweeter smells of sweet chocolate a bit of caramel. Along with these are some hints of vanilla and a bit of a bready smell, overall giving a nice roasty and sweet stout smell. Taste – The taste begins with a sweet chocolate and oat taste with lots of vanilla sweetness. A moderate amount of roastiness is present right from the start which fades a bit as the taste advances. A bit of a coffee flavor comes to the tongue more toward the middle with a little bit of a molasses and light earthy hop flavor comes to the tongue. In the end a nice roasted, and sweet oatmeal stout flavor is left to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the average to slightly lower side. Both are rather nice for the roasted and sweet flavors of the beer and make for a very easy drinking but soothing feel. Overall – A rather enjoyable brew overall. Nice, sweet, raoasty, oats, and smooth flavors with a very easy drinking feel.

Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;Draught at the brewpub Maybe once an ordinary Ale, but with the ginseng it now smells like dusty roots and tastes like cleaning product and bitter medicine.
Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;With all of these odd ones, you figure they are experiments. But no, they are here to stay. A bit of ginsing in the aroma, some lace all the way down the glass. There is some taste here, and I do not know how it got here, tea infusion? Lighter than average mouthfeel. A so-so lager with some taste.
Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;on tap-pours a thin white head and yellow color. Aroma is ginger, ginseng. Almost an organic/herbal chili.

Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;i just don’t get why anyone makes beer like this. Why would you want to drink more than a couple of swallows? And what’s so inviting or flavourfull about ginseng? Another gimic beer that doesn’t pass the test.

Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;Pacific Northwest Vacation 2007 8/24/2007: Hugo’s Super G Ginseng Cream Ale is hazy and has a deep golden color with an ample foamy white head. The aroma is quite floral with some distinct ginseng notes. The flavor has fruity malt, creamy wheat, and some banana and ginseng. I was surprised at how noticeable the ginseng actually was in this beer. The beer is medium-light and really not that bad. I was pleasantly surprised! Draught sample at Hugo’s Lounge in Victoria, BC, Canada. Rating #12 for this beer...
Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;Strong ginger aroma, pours a golden yellow with a small head with decent lace. Tastes of ginger, vegetables, light malt backbone and a nice spicy aftertaste. Thin body with decent carb. Not bad, well-balanced - better than the St. Peter’s ginger beer effort. Well executed, but not something I’d have again.
Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;that rates dont suggest this is very good but i thought it was somewhat intrigueing/ maybe because i have never fallen victim to a ginseng beer. this one was basically taking their pilsner and adding ginseng. nose was high n genseng aromas, bitter crunch of the root on the palate. got more subtle as we drank...i was gettn kinda trashed at this point. so who really knows. my second favorite of the hugo beers.
Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;At Hugos. Pale golden, no head. Spicy, a bit nut, some chili-like notes, herbal finishing - quite messed up really. Light body, black tea aftertaste. Just bizarre - not for me...
Hugos Super G Ginseng Cream Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;Draft at the brewery Golden orange and clear appearance. Spicy, peppery, the ginger almost comes out like a jalapeno flavor. The ginger itself seems subdued, but there’s these other byproduct scents and flavors that are produced. The body is somewhat light and fizzy, and overall this beer is pretty one-dimensional.

Speciale Op-Ale 1832;Opwijk, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);One of the few very classical and long-lived Belgian amber ales (’spéciale belge’), since 1935. Rating based on old tasting notes (thirteen years ago): pure amber colour, off-white head, with the expected nutty maltiness in aroma and taste, along with some ethereal spices (aniseed?), biscuit, dried fruits and grassy hops in the finish. One of the more delicate and refinded examples of the style - and my favorite when it comes to classic ’spéciales belges’. But that was back then, and now that Heineken has basically ruined the Affligem abbey beers from the same brewery and seeing other ratings here of the current version, I’m afraid my rating has become obsolete - will therefore rate again when I encounter a fresh bottle.

River City Rock Island Red;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);64 ounce growler. I had an opportunity to visit River City while I was in the area last weekend, and I actually came away rather unimpressed. Most of their beers came across as very average at best. Still, I picked what I thought was the best of the lot, the Red Ale, in a growler to try at home. The growler is about a week old but has been sealed the entire time and in my fridge. Pours a bright amber that has, shockingly, red, undertones. Some head on the beer with moderate lacing. Mild aroma with some grassy hop notes and caramel malt character. First taste is underwhelming. Very malty with some mild bitterness and more grassy hops in the finish. The taste can best be described as burnt sugar minus the smokiness. Meh. It’s still not that great. The good news is that it’s a very watery beer which means I should be able to drink it quickly, even though it’s not all that enjoyable. Should have passed on picking up a growler.
River City Rock Island Red;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark iced tea brown with a thin beige head. The nose is quite muted: just some dark caramel malt. On the medium side of light-bodied, the palate has a grainy texture and a burnt, astringent finish. The flavor is of burnt caramel malt with a biting bitter finish. This is not a pleasant beer.

Aroma is fairly oxidized, with sour dark fruits and Belgian yeast. Flavour is quite sour now, with tart dark fruits, some vinegar, oxidation, and syrupy notes. Pretty viscous palate.

Fredericksburg Enchanted Rock Red Ale;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;4 oz. plastic sample cup, draft, from the back room at the Brew Pub in Fredericksburg, Texas. The pour is a mostly clear ruby golden, with not too much of an off white head. The aroma is light malt sweetness along with a touch of honey floral. Malty sweet nose, though certainly not cloying. The taste is the sweet malt, along with a nice nut character, and then ends with some of the sweet floral of the nose. The palate is medium bodied, coats the mouth a bit. Nice Red.

Sparkling dark copper pour, persistent bone colored head, sticky lacing. Pleasant molasses and dates in the aroma,.

Fredericksburg Jailhouse Bock;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;On tap at brewery on January 17, 2009. Dark, cloudy amber-brown color with a gleaming, thin film of a head - not solid at all. Brown aroma, almost chocolaty. Flavor is of toasted chocolate. Would never have guessed this was a lager at first. Light palate, though... but full. Great flavor! Wow... why is everyone rating the good beer bad and all the bad beers good from Fredericksburg? Ich muss einer Auslander gewesen... or the brewery isn’t consistent.
Fredericksburg Jailhouse Bock;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;"not bad at all for a beer that was described as ""if shiner had balls."" it was quite creamy and good though."
Fredericksburg Jailhouse Bock;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Could be much better, and should be. Not bad, but I wanted more chocolate and sweetness. Better than Ziegen Bock, for sure. About even with Shiner.
Fredericksburg Jailhouse Bock;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;My first beer at the GABF. Luckily it went uphill from there. .............
Fredericksburg Jailhouse Bock;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;A bit skunky and weak, but hey, I'm a bock fan. I got the feeling (for no real rational reason) that they're still working on it. Shiner or Ziegen bock still wins out over it though.
Fredericksburg Jailhouse Bock;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Not one of the better bocks out there. I would drink a shiner any day of the week over this. Too watery, nothing special about it...I tasted no chocolate either.
Fredericksburg Dunkel Weizen;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Mmmm, a nice example of the dunkel weizen style. Roasty. Chocolatey. Wonderful.
Fredericksburg Dunkel Weizen;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;"By far the best beer they had to offer at the micro-brew in Fredericksburg, Texas, but maybe that's just because I like strong stuff. Rich taste, hints of chocolate. After drinking this, the other beers at the brewery are basically water. Served cool, it's just right; at room temperature it's TOO strong."
Fredericksburg Dunkel Weizen;Fredericksburg, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Fredericksburg Brewing Company;Pretty damn good, it was served a bit too cold for maximum tasting, but very good nonetheless. Nice blend of malts and hops.

McNeill's Wassail Special Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;McNeill's Brewery;Boisterous effervescent gingerbread and cinnamon-nutmeg nose emitted from the bottle upon opening. Poured like an erupting volcano science project that rivals many highly carbonated Belgians. Persisted a three-finger almond cream colored head that looked spoon-worthy. Body continued to bubble vigorously after several moments. Rich copper color. Stinging mouthfeel from carbonation and Christmas spices. Lingering slightly metallic (infected?) finish. Sweet and unbalanced. Probably not enjoyed at the right time of year (May).
McNeill's Wassail Special Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;McNeill's Brewery;Hazy amber coppery colored, with aroima of caramel malt, some hops, a lot of Christmas spices. Medium to dense palate with caramel bready malt, hops, big spices, getting a bit spicier as it warmed.
McNeill's Wassail Special Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;McNeill's Brewery;2005 bomber consumed on 3/30/06 Light amber with copper tresses and a huge amount of beige head, fairly dense, consisting of very compact, tiny, bottle conditioned bubbles. Prominent lacing in wisps. Nose begins with soft gingerbread and light cookie dough malts. Vigorous, tiny bubbles move up through the liquid, carrying the aroma strongly from the glass. Cinnamon, allspice and tastefully done ginger. Refreshingly similar to Anchor OSA of years past. Spicy, but with a full backing of cookieish malts. Fresh yeast mixes with the spice to refresh the senses at every sniff. Flavor is spicy with light licorice dryness, that lingers on the palate, while ginger adds to the spice level. Not as sweet as the nose would suggest, with more dry pale malts, caramel sugars (though dry) and maybe a touch of crystal malt? Light breadiness on end, with a mild sourdough note that melds well with the sugars, adding complexity. Ginger and light licorice linger on end creating a balance. Though the spice is prominent, the round, sweet malts soak it up and the chewy-smooth texture rounds the astringency in to spiciness that simply refreshes. 45 minutes later, the balance even improves, if that’s possible. Engaging, tight carbonation with an unfiltered, substantial texture and no sign of alcohol.
McNeill's Wassail Special Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;McNeill's Brewery;22 oz bottle - thanks once again to gputty for splitting this with me. Pours a golden orange, off white head. Nose is lots of orange and clove. Other spices and fruits are in there, but mostly orange and clove. Flavor is orange rind (a touch tart and slightly bitter) and winter spices, esp. nutmeg and clove. Finish is fairly clean, a bit of orange rind lingers. I rather liked this one.
McNeill's Wassail Special Ale;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Flavored - Other;McNeill's Brewery;22oz: Medium bottle-conditioned orange, leaving a dull fading off-white cover. Christmas fruit cake drowned in spices dominate the nose. Hard to pick up malts shine and annoy by their absence while an enumeration of spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves...) form a row that strikes the senses one after the other without much attention for cohesion. Faint crystallized cookie malt background. Flavorful, but hardly balanced, sweet and repetitive from sip to sip, the carbonation enhancing the beginning of a metallic feel and growing a sloppy character that loosens and waters down the already not very tight components. Lazy and unpolished.

Butcombe Gold (Bottle);Wrington, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Butcombe Brewery (Liberation Group);I figured that this would be a crappier version of Butcome Bitter but it was actually much better than the original. It resembles a light, golden ale but with a solid malt underpinning the lighter, grassy and hoppy flavours. It is a good match and well balanced. Very British, but not boring. 500ml bottle from somewhere in Cornwall, thanks to Dad :)

Butcombe Gold (Bottle);Wrington, Somerset, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Butcombe Brewery (Liberation Group);500ml dark bottle, filtered, from Asda. 4.7%. It’s more a best bitter than a gold or blonde. Colour is old gold blended with orange and amber. There’s more malt character in this than one would normally expect from a gold or blonde beer, and the hops are more traditional English than modern, citric and zingy. This is my first time with this beer in the bottle, and its been a while since I had it in the cask, but I do recall the cask version from way back being more in the blonde style with citric hops. Anyway, forget the name, and this is an OK best bitter. Perhaps a tad too many hops for me, giving this a slightly dusty bitterness, but I like the slightly toasty malt character. It’s a little old fashioned, but, for me, that’s not a bad thing. Drinkable, and reasonably attractive.
Ushers IPA;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);From old tasting notes. Orange, copper color. Rocky beige . Mild fruity citrus malt nose. Tart fruity malt flavor is balanded by an assertive citrus hop finish.
Ushers IPA;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);500ml bottle sampled many years ago pours a pale golden amber color with a finger of white head that leaves some spotted lacing on the glass. Aroma is caramel and citrus with some earthy notes. Taste is a light citrus and earthy hop bitterness with a caramel malty sweetness. The hop are more pronounced than most of the English bitters. Overall, this is about average as this style goes.

Ushers IPA;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Had this beer on 10/2/1999. Aroma is a sweet malt scent with an odd paint like scent in the back. Taste is a medium body that starts with a mild malt flavor but just gets bad from there on. Its just not good.
Ushers IPA;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);(Bottle 50 cl) Amber golden with a lightly creamy head. Lovely fresh nose with both malts and hops coming through. Solid body, aroma hops being quite dominant, and sightly nutty flavours. Only moderately bitter finish. A very sympathetic brew. 120800

Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Gold with low carbonation, bright white head.

Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);1998 Vintage. Aroma is yeast, malt and lemon, yellow, pours a small white head. Flavour has yeast, malt and some lemony notes. Light bodied, a bit sweet. Ordinary. Thank You very much Michael Robis of Chester’s Beers of the World, Hamilton!
Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);(Bottle 50 cl) Pale ales are common in Belgium but I believe rather rare elsewhere. Pilsener golden with a small head. Comes with the vinous character of the other Usher vintage beers, but completely lacks the juicy fullness from the darker malts. A bit like a dry sherry. Almost no bitterness. Very unusual if not to say unique. 260603
Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottled, Pasteurised. Light yellow gold colour, whispy short head. A fruity, banana and vanilla concoction with a tangy hoppy overlay. Sharp thin finish. Quite disappointing.
Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);The aroma is fresh and fruity with metallic notes. The color is orange and it has a small fast disappearing head. The flavor is flat, fruity, and metallic. All in all a weird below average ale.
Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottle. Bright golden colour but poor head and moderate condition. Initial shortlived aroma of hops, some background hop flavour, but dominated by a nasty cheap lager like taste. Reminded me of Fischer Tradition, which is no great reccomendation
Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);A sharp and acidic beer. A cross between a pale ale and a cider. Unusual, but no better for it. Ushers Ruby is a classic - buy that instead.
Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Golden ale with vanilla tones. Malty and flavourful, but still the least interesting in Usher's vintage range.
Ushers White Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Complex, vinous fruitiness and thick slice of malt. Nothing wheaty about it. A very unique ale, as it brings flavours typical of an English golden ale, but much bigger.

Ushers Tawny Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottle. 1998 vintage. Bright copperish-tawny coloured body with a medium white bubbly head. The aroma is moderately cheesy, lots of bread, and sweet caramel-like malts. Certainly the rich malts are prominent in this beer - lots of bread, some sourish malt, and sweet caramel flavours. Soft, creamy palate. Pretty good. Thanks for sharing this, Doug.
Ushers Tawny Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Vintage 1998. Amber with bright white head indicating hoppy character.

Ushers Tawny Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Pours a tall airy tan head on a slightly hazy amber colored body. Aroma is malty and spicy with a roasted tone and hints of alcohol. Plenty of malt in the flavor. Notes of fruit, raisin, prune, hop and liquorice. Some sourness in the end. Tasty but rather thin bodied.
Ushers Tawny Ale;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottled, pasteursed. Golden amber with restained head. Understated fruity sweetish beer with a caramel base. Almost port like in character with a late hoppiness.
Ushers 1824 Particular;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Old Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);From old tasting notes. Deep ruby red, brown color topped by a rocky beige head. Spicy, aromatic malt/hop nose. Peppery, bittersweet roasted malt flavor hints at radicchio and espresso. Wonderful malt/hop balance. Lacks residual sweetness common in Winter Warmers. Very tasty, nonetheless.
Ushers 1824 Particular;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Old Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Quite pronounced caramel aroma. Flavor is comparatively quite a bit drier and lighter than expected, a bit like dilute caramel, but pleasant drinking all the same.
Ushers 1824 Particular;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Old Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Pours a medium to dark brown. Aromas of vanilla, sweet malt, and dried cherries. Very light and a bit thin with flavors of vanilla, green apple, and sweet corn. This is ok but not my favourite.
Ushers 1824 Particular;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Old Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);11.2 oz bottle This was lurking on a back shelf at the local store. For only $2.00 I willing to give it a shot. In the end it was a nice discovery although I am not the biggest fan of this style. Still if you are either trying to count down English counties or just prefer lighter drinking beers this is worth investigating. You could do far worse. Aroma / Appearance - The short lived pillowy head bobs on a sea of dense brown fluid. The reddish gradient gives it is a nice contrast against a setting sun. Chocolate truffle, caramel, and overdone white toast surprise the nose with more complexity than you would think. Flavor / Palate - The taste of a caramel filled chew washes across the tongue followed by mild malts. Tasting much like a butterscotch treat it has some depth but does not overwhelm the palate with options. Virtually sessionable my only objection would be that after a while the flavors begin to collect on the back of the throat. The chocolaty finish is not bad but also overstays its welcome. Nonetheless this is a nice value at $2.00 and possibly worth picking it up if it is available in your area and you want something different.

Nothing seemed to jump out at me, pretty baisic. Good for beer pong maybe or if your wanting to drink something other than Bud or Miller, just to drink get drunk. Not to impressed.
McCoys Newcombs IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;McCoy's Public House;It was too sweet for the IPA style. Some hops up front but then it gets oddly sweet and the palate has too many sugars. Aroma is average with hops and citrus. Tap at brewery.
McCoys Newcombs IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;McCoy's Public House;"a bit cold to provide accurate nose description, I’d say malt and yeast and citrus; light reddish brown, clear, small unremarkable head and weak lacing; taste--acidic rounded not discernibly sweet, dry palate and spritzy"
McCoys Newcombs IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;McCoy's Public House;"There is nothing wrong w this brew. Well, not in any major sense. An average IPA beats most other styles any day of the week. I think it tasted OK but I was ready to move on after finishing one pint. The overall malt flavor, hop nose and aftertaste were on the lower end of good, for my preferences. As an honest man and home brewer, I should be a little more forgiving. My wife, friends and family have graciously drained bottles and kegs of strange brews I’ve concocted at home. And I’m a firm believer that there is a beer for every palate and that I’m not the only Judge. Opinions are like certain body parts, and mine is but one opinion. That said, flavors and smells can conjure up memories from our past: both pleasant and otherwise. I was born behind the cheddar curtain. And Milwaukee,WI is the home of many less than average beers. PBR is a brand I would gladly display over my bar in my basement, but not because it satisfies my palate. I just love Wisconsin and the PBR beer signs haning outside every tavern in the great North Woods. I’ve been convinced a number of times to try and retry PBR, but to no avail. There is a strong foul flavor in that grog that builds to a resounding crescendo, as I’ve strived to finish every PBR I’ve started. I want to like it for nostalgic purposes, but can’t get past the flavor. In a small way, this grog made me think of PBR. There is a certain ""off"" flavor, that I cannot overcome by will or decision. Something has spoiled the potion. There is a fly in that ointment. I think I mentioned that I’m a home brewer. That doesn’t make ME the expert. Casting stones is not my intention. This IPA just does not satisfy my IPA longings. It does not finish with that malty sweet, aromatic malt/hop bouquet. It could be the hop choice itself that imparts the off flavor that resurrected my memories of past beers gone bad. I can’t determine whether to place judgement on the hop, the malt or the process that produces the unsatisfactory olfactory response for me. I’ve never produced a brew that reminds me of this. Neither could the guy next to me at the bar, as we watched game 3 of the 2014 World Series in KC. He and I both agreed that this brew is not yet where it needs to be to compete w a Rocky Mountain or West Coast micro craft brew. That said, I apologize for my comparison to PBR. This brew is very different and far superior. But the flavor & aftertaste did conjure up some haunting memories that I would rather have kept suppressed."
McCoys Newcombs IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;McCoy's Public House;An average IPA. The aroma windows of citrus hoppiness. The color was a slightly dark golden with a small head. The palate was relatively light with a decent amount of carbonation and crispness on the finish. The hoppiness was there but not too harsh on the bitterness. The malt and caramel flavors could’ve been amped up a little bit. Overall an okay beer.
McCoys Newcombs IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;McCoy's Public House;A slightly better than average IPA. Really mild with a touch of citrus. Lots of hay and grass.
McCoys Newcombs IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;McCoy's Public House;Clear, light. Opper color. Sticky white head. Earthy, malty and hop cone aroma. Bitter, malty, and somewhat heavy for what it is. Finish is a bit shatp. Bitterness lingers on the tongue for quite a while.
McCoys Newcombs IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;McCoy's Public House;On tap at the Foundry. Pours a clear amber gold with a near white head that dissipates to the edges.

McCoys Newcombs IPA;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;McCoy's Public House;Pint at McCoys. This arrived in a shaker pint very clear with some copper color. An off white layer is less than a finger. A soft flral and pale malt aroma. There is floral in the flavor with citrus.. Bitterness is fairly big and the hops seem fresh. Biscuit is light.

McCoys Hog Pound Brown;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;McCoy's Public House;Not bad for a basic brown. Sort of a New Castle style with a bit sweet, a touch watery, and the end has some bitter nut malts. Clear brown coloring. Not exciting. Tap at brewery.

McCoys Hog Pound Brown;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;McCoy's Public House;Average brown ale at best. Aromas were a faint roasted malt. Brown color that appeared light.

Drinkable and light.

Sweet cherry juice box nose after a big vegetal / DMS whiff typical of their house beers. Taste is not so bad, mild hop and sweet cherry juice, clean cherry and berries in finish. Not bad. Suddy, peroxide mouthfeel. Probably their best beer.

McCoys Hog Pound Brown;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;McCoy's Public House;February 27, 2013 - on tap at Foundry. Clear brown pour with limited head and spotty lacing. Aroma and taste were malty and mild hops. Maybe some nutty aroma and flavor as it warmed.

McCoys 12 Grain Amber Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;McCoy's Public House;Caramel aroma. Clear medium amber color and slight visible carbonation. Some typical sweet amber flavors, but has a certain spiciness to the flavor profile and and a rather sharp, hop-accented finish. Interesting, but not enough deviation to cause me to recommend it highly.
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;Slight pinkish hew. Very thin and somewhat watery. Raspberry isn’t overpowering, actually somewhat subtle. Ketch a hint of wheat. Smooth, but not my cup of tea.... or in this case glass of beer.
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;On tap at McCoys in KC. Listed as Redlight Raspberry on the menu, but I see no one’s rated this in 2 years...oh well. It actually tasted and smelled more like a raspberry wheat, so hopefully its actually not the Raspberry Wheat. Poured a hazy dirty yellow wheat looking body with a thin white head that left quickly and ended up looking pretty watery. Aroma of wheat and raspberry. Sweet soda pop almost. Flavor was similar. Very light and carbonated with a sugary, artificial raspberry taste and a slightly wheat malted backing. Boring, sugary finish with no lingering taste. Overall, probably the worst beer I’ve tried at this brewpup so far. Worse than their ginger shandy, which didn’t even taste like a beer.
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;On tap at the brewpub. I could not even finish the sample. The hazy pink body was topped with a white head. The aroma was lots of raspberries and a little floral. The taste has some flat, bad fruity 7 Up. There is also some bad grapefruit juice. Another McCoy’s beer with a flat and lifeless body.
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;On tap at the brewpub (KC). This was brought out as a Raspberry Wheat, but I had trouble picking up on the wheat. This one tasted like a Blackcherry soda to me, with artificial Raspberry sweetener added. Not really my type of brew.
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;Artificial berry aroma, thin and fizzy with a bit too much carbonation. Light, with a syrupy bit of fruity sweetness, and a bit of slightly toasted cereal malt in the finish. Bland and undrinkable. Why?
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;Hazy Yellow/Peach Coloring with No Head. Subtle Razz Aroma... Thin Mouthfeel..Light, somewhat Potent Razz Taste..Probably From Using ’Flavoring’ ..Wheat Comes up in Aftertaste...Unbalanced but Still Light and Drinkable.
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;Sampled on draft at McCoys. Pours cloudy peach in color with little head or lacing (just like it’s base beer, Landing Light, but colored). Aroma is pretty clean, with only notes of berries. The flavor is quite one-dimensional: raspberry syrup. I dislike fruit beers that have that syrup character. Light-bodied and light to medium carbonation. Uninteresting.
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;St. Louis Park, MN location. Slightly hazy yellow color with a thin head. Aroma is a little reminiscent of raspberry scented Lysol, but not too bad. Very light on the raspberry in the taste with not much else except a pinch of wheat. Unoffensive.
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;"I didn’t like this one. I t was a raspbery soda water with minimal beer flavors. Havent had their wheat maybe thats why its so mild is cuz the wheat is. The coloring was interesting kind of pinkish purpulish with some fizz going on. There is no real flavor to speak of; give me some more of something."
McCoys RedLight Raspberry;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Fruit;McCoy's Public House;Very light and clear with a straw coloroing. Raspberry extract character, syrupy sweet, a lip-smacker. I’m tired of this style. This is just OK.
Rugenbräu Spezial Hell;Interlaken, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rugenbräu;I have found this beer, in one shop, at Ostermudigen. I have tried this beer, at home, in Epalinges, during this winter. In my point of view, it is an average pils, on the Swiss way. The color is yellow and clear, normal carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste has notes of dry malt, hop, probably perle or saaz, a bit watery and a bit soapy.
Rugenbräu Spezial Hell;Interlaken, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rugenbräu;Bottle from Dorflade, Wengen. Light yellow pour steady but thin white head. Nose is sweet malt.

Poiluchette Brune Cuvée du Château;Melle, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brouwerij Huyghe;"Bière brune de 7,5 % abv, qui est davantage une double qu'une belgian strong. Mon exemplaire était à 24 mois avant sa date. Couleur caramel foncé, à la clarté brillante. Bulles fines, partout, vives. Mousse beige à flocons moyens, stable à 1 mm. Arômes de malt cara, prune, pointe de poire. 1ère bouche très pétillante sur malt cara, poire, pointe d'amertume. Arrière-bouche caramélisée, courte. 2ème qui tient la même ligne. 3ème assez vague, avec un rien de chocolat. Arrière-bouche un peu plus longue. Longueur qui ne peut rien développer. Jambes lisses. Levure basique. Alcool qui fait un petit effort sur la longueur, mais n'arrive à rien. Finale ordinaire. CONCLUSION : rien à dire, sauf que cette bière n'est surtout pas une ""cuvée du château"" !!

Pierreuse Bière Régionale;Waremme (Oleye), Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Oleye;Well, my label states ’la brasserie artisanale La Fourmilière’ as the brewery. There’s a couple of words on the revival of this (?) beer on http://users.skynet.be/casanica/la_fourmiliere.htm . My rating for a 33 cl bottle, bottling / ’bbe’ = ? (sorry, I cannot be bothered to translate it from Dutch at this late hour): Roodbruin, bijna volkomen doorzichtig biertje met weinig pareling en een beige schuimpje dat snel inzakt. Met zijn droge, melkzurige, licht fruitige aroma heeft het heel wat weg van een oud bruin. Kazige hopzweempjes laten zich ook waarnemen. De smaak gaat aan de ene kant ook wat in de oud bruin-richting, maar is aan de andere kant veel droger en vertoont een redelijk bittere afdronk. Een toets van kersen. De alcohol verwarmt de mondholte nog lang na het inslikken.
Pierreuse Bière Régionale;Waremme (Oleye), Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Oleye;(Bottle 75 cl) Deep amber colour with a frothy head which refuses to let go of the side of my glass - lovely.

If you expect a sweetish, malty Brune then look elsewhere - Oleye offers something different. Dry and spicy with the usual slight tartness - unless it’s an unintentional infection? Leaves a lovely freshness in your mouth, but it’s not really bitter. Alcohol is very well hidden. Unusual but nice. 041001

Maribo Guld Export;Maribo, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Maribo Bryghus (Royal Unibrew);Can from Frederikshavn. Very sweet. Round, easy drinking, not too bad, but more bitter and aroma hops would have made this a decent brew. You get what you pay for, I guess!

Thor Lakseguld;Randers, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Thor Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);"Poor salmon (Laks means salmon)You had deserved better than this. It starts out good, but very soon comes all the bad things in danish ""guldøl"" to force: Bread-yeast-taste. Say no more."
Thor Fregatten Jylland;Randers, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Thor Bryggerierne (Royal Unibrew);Fine malty aroma with hints of little fruit. The flavor is very sweet and reveals again fruit - perhaps peach? - And a little citrus released to a slightly hoppy aftertaste. It is undoubtedly a good lager if you like high percentages of alcohol and sweet beer. I miss a little response from a more aggressive hoppy aftertaste that could keep the sweetness in balance. The high percentage of alcohol does not scare me, in fact I think its alcohol is flattering to this particular beer.

Reminds me of a get pissed quick type heavy beer (its not that bad though) I thought that it was quite lager like in taste without being truly aware what the style actually was, so pleased that I got that spot on. This isn’t great its a bit rough but at 70p or 80p a bottle its a damn sight cheaper than some beers and is also far from being a bad beer.

Hitachino Nest XH (Extra High);Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Belle couleur cuivrée presque limpide. Mousse quasiment inexistante. Nez bien malté, bien rond avec des notes de caramel et de miel. Carbonatation assez violente, amertume assez importante dès l'entrée de bouche. C'est très sec et l'alcool se fait vite sentir (sans doute le saké). On retrouve le duo caramel/miel avec du boisé très présent en fin de bouche, et qui perdure longuement. C'est très brut de décoffrage, pas fan... :/

Fuller's Vintage Ale 2001;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Ennobled luxury edition of Fuller’s Golden Pride and like all vintages produced in very limited quantities. Provisional ale, undoubtedly with impressive ageing capacities. Yellowish white, sticky but thin and quickly dissolving head, colour a darkish amber approaching copper, misty. Powerful and attractive aroma of fresh oranges, peaches and pineapples, single malt, amaretto, honey, pepper, cake, chocolate, cane sugar... Tingling sweet fruitiness in the onset, orange peel, soft caramel- and honey-like malts staying throughout the palate, spicy notes, bit creamier in the middle, finishing with a whiff of English hops but mostly warming alcohol, like orange liqueur and gin, even a bit wry, the initial sweetness also sticking a bit. Refined, but too thin of body and too astringent finish to be truly great.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;22oz bottle. Poured an amber color with an off white head. Citrus, toasted grains and floral.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a semi-dark orange close to amber color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a moderate pace. Slight lace. The aroma had some caramel/toffee malt flowing over some citrusy to floral hoppy portions. The flavor blended fairly nice between the hops and the malts, pretty nice. Consistent blend in the aftertaste and finish. The feel was about medium bodied, maybe just a tad underneath. Decent session about it. Carbonation seemed fine and so was the ABV. Overall, pretty good amber ale worthy of having again, perhaps.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;bottle thanks to fletchwadd Light amber color,small off white head that lasted for a decent time then faded to a small lace.Malty semi-sweet aroma with a hint of caramel and maybe some fruit.The hops seem nicely done.Pretty good flavor of mild malt then a nice amount of hop flavor,sort of bitter-sweet and mildly fruity.Nice and smooth for the most part and fairly drinkable.Well worth trying if you can get it.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;Poured to a hazey copper color leaving little off white sud lines. Malty/ floral with a taste of a citrusy hops amd an aftertaste that lingers
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized off-white colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a typically carbonated transparent weak amber colored body. The mild aroma was dirty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of brown malt and hops. A decent one but not one that I would consider drinking again.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;On tap. Dark amber pour. Carmel malts, bitter astertaste. Decent Amber, nothing special.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;Rated 3-16-2012. Bottle purchased in December, 2011 at Siciliano’s Market in Grand Rapids, MI. Poured a medium sized very fizzy ivory head that mostly diminished, spotty amounts of lacing, slightly hazy body, fizzy, fast-rising carbonation, and an orange to golden hue. The aroma is malty, floral hops, sweet, and a hint of caramel. The flavor is semi-sweet, malty, floral hops, and has a short dry finish. The mouthfeel is tingly and this is a light-medium bodied Amber Ale. Overall, it is easy to drink and could be a session beer even at 6%ABV as the ABV is well hidden.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;Sampled at an esbls tasting. I bought this in Michigan. Thus pours hazy mid brown and has a funky off white head. I smell fruity hs first with rich sweet caramel. Those are also tasted. Some grass, too. This is a sweet, almost sugary beer but i like sweeter beers.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;Bomber bottle, label lists 6% alc., so, the alcohol has changed, this beer has a red and burnt orange pour (with a light haze), gave a one and a half finger of off-white and light tan bubbled head, effervescence was about medium, I got a little lacing on the glass, there was a good layer of dark sediment in the bottle, there were aromas of toasted malt, light fruit, and a little citrus hop, the flavors were toasted malt and faint caramel with a little fruit, citrus and leafy/earthy like hops, finish has a little hop bitterness and a bit of an off flavor, I do not know what the off flavor is from, mouth feel is a little less than medium, there seems to be a lot of carbonation on the palate and it gives a carb bite on the tongue, this is an ok Amber Ale.
Frog Island Amber Ale;Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Frog Island Brewing;Draft. Pours dark amber, thin off-white head, spotty lacing. Nose is crystal malt, spicy citrus hops. Flavours are rich and caramelly, some nice spiciness here, but this doesn’t grab me. Meh.
Sherlocks Home Bishops Bitter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Tap. Dark golden color with a well laced white head. Creamy and smooth. Malty, caramel, vine, and a little dry.
Sherlocks Home Bishops Bitter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Golden amber, thin head. Smooth and easy drinking, with a bit of caramel. Fruitiness in aroma. Gentle bitterness on tongue, though a bit thin (naturally, being hand-pulled and cellar temperature). Exceptionally good within the style.
Sherlocks Home Bishops Bitter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Perhaps the quality of the Bishop''s Bitter has taken a hit since the closing of Sherlock''s Home was announced recently. I do not share the glowing reviews of my fellow raters on this one. Although it scores well in the intangible qualities of appearance and aroma, and has a nicely generous hoppy finish, the flavor and mouthfeel are far too thin. It''s like taking a light beer and injecting hops in it with nothing with which to balance it. This brew can''t touch Sherlock''s IPA.
Sherlocks Home Bishops Bitter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Perhaps the best bitter I've had in America (which is not saying much, admittedly). They serve it at the right temperature, and the hoppiness is reminiscent of the better bitter in England. And it's close to my house. Of course Jenny is holier than thou when it comes to that sort of thng.
Sherlocks Home Bishops Bitter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;"I usually hate brew pubs but this one is class ""A."" They have good fish and chips and good bitter. This bitter is better than many of the mass produced English ones I've tried. It can't compete with the smaller bitters for overall character and aroma, simply betcause I don't think you can quite get the right water in Minnesota to pull that off. If you like this style of beer, I would highly recommend a rural pub tour of England, but this is the next best thing I suppose. My only possible complaint is the location which is frankly absurd (I imagine when they built it was a bit more in the country) in the middle of horrible plastic West Minneapolis Suburban hell."
Sherlocks Home Bishops Bitter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Amazing cask-conditioned bitter. This is the beer that will probably force me to fly to england to taste some real real ale. A very large amount of flavor for the level of alcohol present in this beer. Great mouthfeel and the delicacy of this beer blows my mind. There is a reason that Michael Jackson visits this place every year and this is it.
Sherlocks Home Pipers Pride;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Tap. Brown color with a rimmed head. Grass and malt flavors. Some hops in the aroma. Not sweet at all. Too light in the body and weak overall.
Sherlocks Home Pipers Pride;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Dark brown with edges of copper/amber. Musty, woody aroma, no suggestion of sweetness characteristic of the style. Thin body, with no sweetness or richness. Disappointing.
Sherlocks Home Pipers Pride;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;I was surprised at how smoothly this went down -- it's definitely full bodied, but it's not overwhelming.
Sherlocks Home Pipers Pride;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;What a classy beer. It is very full bodied and refrains from the overuse of caramel flavor that some interpretations of this style are prone to. Mildly roasty with a dominant ale malt character. Pulled and served perfectly with a subtle but fresh hint of hops.
Sherlocks Home Pipers Pride;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Scottish Ale;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Glorious dark amber. Sweet malty aroma with hints of hops. Flavor is a gently strong maltiness backed with a very delicate, but present, hoppiness. Probably the best Scottish ale I have ever tasted. (cask conditioned)
Sherlocks Home Queen Anne Light;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;My wife usually drinks this, as she does not like darker beers. It's quite good for what it is: an light lager. Just not for me when there are so many other good beers and ales and Sherlock's Home.
Sherlocks Home Gold Crown Lager;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Although a lager, this brew has some moderate hoppiness to it and is reminiscent of a good ESB. Large, mostly lasting, rocky head with excellent lacing. Medium dark, reddish brown, murky body. A very good effort.
Sherlocks Home Star of India IPA;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;I love this beer! And am saddened that it may have been my last taste since Sherlock's will be cosing its doors on Dec. 31. It has been one of the Twin Cities' most sophisticated drinking establishments. The aroma is rich and beautifully hoppy. Although the head is small it is mostly lasting and produces good lace. Has a hazy, amber body. The flavor is tough to beat. Has all the complexity and hops of a good American IPA, but is smoother and has the typical finish of a fine English bitter. Simply excellent.
Sherlocks Home Star of India IPA;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Overly hoppy, which gives it a nice aroma, but a very bitter flavor with no subtlety. I know IPAs are supposed to be very hoppy, and i generally like hoppiness, but this made beers like Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale seem weakly hopped. On the plus side it made my usual pint of bishop's bitter that much sweeter, literally.
Sherlocks Home Star of India IPA;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;A very good IPA -- hoppy and rich. It's just not very unique................
Sherlocks Home Star of India IPA;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Not a bad IPA, but nothing special. Stick to the Pipers Pride or the bitter when at Sherlocks Home.
Sherlocks Home Palace Porter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Tap. Solid black color with a laced light-brown head. Biscuit, malts, leather, and a little sour. A long coffee roasted aftertaste.
Sherlocks Home Palace Porter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Solid black with caramel lace. woody, cask aroma and a bit of fruit. Leathery sourness. Long finish, roasted and smokey, with a watery body, not entirely the function of being at the proper (warm) temperature. Tastes like an old castle keep--musty and old wood.
Sherlocks Home Palace Porter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;I usually have a pint of this for dessert. It's chocolatey and rich.........
Sherlocks Home Palace Porter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;I agree, Sherlock's Home is a brewpub not to be missed. Roasty porter with an attractive dark head. Roasty bitterness is balanced with a nice sweetness in the malt. A good one, by the way this is served cask conditioned only.
Sherlocks Home Palace Porter;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;"Sherlocks Home is unquestionably one of the best brewpubs I've ever seen, and one of very few where both the food and beer are of highest quality. This sample, like most I've had, was cask-conditioned. Seems to be somewhere between a sweet and robust, with the smoother chocolate malts dominating the front end, and some bitterness and roasted grain sneaking in on the end. Coal-black, small but substantial head. This place is a winnner; I hope to try all of their libations on my next visit to the Twin Cities."
Sherlocks Home Stags Head Stout;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Tap. Black color with a rimmed light brown head. An Irish Stout. Some alcohol/whiskey aftertaste. Aroma has some red wine like fruits. Quick malts.
Sherlocks Home Stags Head Stout;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Just a hint of ruby color, but dark. Very dry. Classic stout, hint of alcoholic sting. Brandy/whisky like in aroma. Mild richness and bitter flavors. Adequate, but not great.
Sherlocks Home Stags Head Stout;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;My review of the Stag Head Stout is luke warm, similar to the temperature in which this beer is served. I appreciate that some beers should be enjoyed at a slightly elevated temperature, but 52 degrees may be a bit warm. This brew hinted unpleasantly of sour milk and was difficult to drink. Dark black body with mostly diminishing head and no lace. Aroma is strong coffee. I''m starting to believe that, like wine, the drier (less sweet) beers should be served cold and the fuller bodied, sweeter beers can be served at warmer temps.
Sherlocks Home Stags Head Stout;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Could be considered a Guinness served warmer. Very nice, very smooth on the way down. Excellent accompanyment to fish and chips. Re-rate: upon reflection, and having had many more beers to compare to, this was not nearly as good as I originally thought. Still solid and a very pleasant pint, it was a bit of a watery stout. Some whisky hints to it.
Sherlocks Home Stags Head Stout;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Stout;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;This is a strong cask-conditioned stout. OG approx 1056. Velvety texture. Attractive head, nice mouthfeel with some vinious notes. I enjoy the handpump mouthfeel so much more than the nitro mouthfeel. YUM
Sherlocks Home Winter Warmer;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Tap. Dark brown and ruby color with a laced tan head. Smooth, creamy, and a coats the mouth. Vineous, cherry, raisin, wood, and malty flavors and aroma. Some wine like alcohol in aroma. My beer #700!
Sherlocks Home Winter Warmer;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Mahogany brown, little head. Musty aroma, with Christmas pudding and raisin. First hint is of fruits, with bitter warming, wine-like. Smooth, but a bit of sticky sweetness leaves some unfortunate aftertastes. Excellent, a pity it is about to become extinct.
Sherlocks Home Winter Warmer;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;A few of these will wipe you right on your butt! It's dark and mysterious, with a wide range of flavors.
Sherlocks Home Winter Warmer;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Cask: granny smith apple aroma (sour apple bubble-yum?), very dark for a barleywine, palate is gaseous, dark grapes, apple, bitter chocolate alongside a bitter hop finish. stellar!
Sherlocks Home Winter Warmer;Minnetonka, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Other;Sherlocks Home Brewpub and Restaurant;Brewed in August and 1 pin (1/8 barrel) is served each day (tapped at 3 PM) between Thanksgiving and Christmas, this Old Ale has an O.G. of 1096. Poured (not pulled) into wine glasses, this beer is a goregous dark amber with very little head/carbonation. The aroma is of dark malts and some faint raisin/sherry scents. The taste is a thousand delights. Flavors dance and weave, sherry, raisins, multiple malt flavors, and also some vinious and alcohol flavors as well. An amazing old ale. There are some sweet malt flavors that are a characteristic of some english old ales/barlewines (Gale's Prize for example and maybe J.W. Lee's) that I cannot stand, this has none of those, and a relatively dry finish. At least a much drier finish than I expected. Alcohol level was 9.8 abv. Truly a beer to travel for and seek out, but there is only one place to get it. Near perfection.
Urthel Hibernus Quentum Tripel;Ruiselede, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Urthel (Swinkels Family Brewers);From old rating. Golden blond colour, white foam .Rather sweet with some citrussy hints, bit earthy, some caramel.

Urthel Hibernus Quentum Tripel;Ruiselede, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Urthel (Swinkels Family Brewers);"From Apr 2007 Pours from 11.2oz bottle a hazy medium gold with a huge billowy head of foam. During the session the foam did shrink a bit but only to a solid 1/4"" layer and there's a *ton* of sticky lacing. The smell has all sorts of fruitiness going that I can only describe as being ""exotic"". I also get some yeastiness and a touch of sweet malt. The taste is as big on the fruit as the smell is. Wow. I wish I could figure out which fruits are there but what ever they are, they are working so nicely in this brew. Further sips in and now I'm getting a huge flavour of earthiness that almost acts like a brick wall so the fruit doesn't dominate completely in the taste. I'm also getting some nice candy sugar and...another wow is required. ;^) The aftertaste leans toward the somewhat bitter side and that just makes the whole drinking experience of this Tripel Ale all the more enjoyable. So complex and all of the different flavours ""tickling"" my palate in such a positive manner. The alcohol has some warming as it goes down but it's not detectable in the taste at all. Damn good stuff!! Bottom line: This is my first bottle of Urthel Hibernus Quentum but it won't be my last. Highly recommended!!"

Aroma: Bready, fruity and Belgian yeast. Palate: Medium (+) body. Moderate sweet and a fresh acidity. Average to rich carbonation. Taste: Mild citric, bready, fruity, apples and Belgian yeast. Overall impression: Not to rich carbonation. It could easily destroyed this beer. Otherwise quite refreshing and ok for a strong ale like this.. Personal stats: Bottle from YNWA in Kolding, Denmark

Clear golden color, fizzy with a small white head that diminished rapidly. Aroma is malts, a little soap, some spice and grassy hops. Unbalanced flavor, light malt sweetness, overly tart hop bite, pepper and sour finish. Lightr body, very fizzy carbonation. However, it looked really cool going down my hotel room sink!

Duivelsbier van Halle;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Een duivels gedrocht dat zeer goed te doen is. Een donker amberkleurig bier met een mooi kaki kleur, de zoetzure smaak is lekker vol.
Duivelsbier van Halle;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Bottle ( 25 cl ) . The backlabel ( if there ever was any ) is missing, and I see no date anywhere on bottle or cap. Presumable around 2000 ??? Pours very dark, nearly black, even. Small white head. Smell is sharp, very port-like sweetness. Taste is mostly oxidation, mildly metallic ( builds up towards the back ) very watery MF. Very mild carbo. There’s an incredibly small aspect of what seems to be funk , but it’s very hidden. Overall, think of oxidized water. Over it’s prime, but probably wasn’t the best one to begin with ?
Duivelsbier van Halle;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;"Tasted many years ago from tap. Deep hazy copper coloured beer with thin head and very estery-fruity flavour, in which honeyish and lots of fruity sweetness, citrussy acidity and lactic acid blend together nicely; sweet-sourish finish, drying and refreshing. Typical old school regional beer rooted in lambic culture, too bad it isn’t made anymore today; the Duivelsbier that succeeded it, is a totally different product."

Duivelsbier van Halle;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Old bottle at Akkurat. Almost clear, red/brown liquid with medium light brown head. Aroma of raw sugar, vinegar, some alcohol, toffee and port/cardboard oxidization. Not too enjoyable. Taste is light sweet and light bitter with notes of raw sugar, vinegar, dark fruit, cardboard, toffee and port wine. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Not in particularly good shape.
Duivelsbier van Halle;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Amber pour with a lot of yeast chunks in it. Very little head. Super oxidized aroma. Lots of sherry, some sweet sugar, a fair amount of cardboard, and a bit of booze, as well. A bunch of miscellaneous dark fruits in the background. The flavor is not much better. Lots of cardboard oxidation, some sherry, dark fruit, and a bit of chocolate. Some caramel sweetness is the best thing about it. Not very good at all.

Duivelsbier van Halle;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;A beer with a rich aroma which, sadly enough, is countered by its sweet taste. Sweetness all around. Surprisingly long aftertaste. I was not aware of the style of beer I ordered so maybe that played a role in my opinion. It is now brewed by Boon, who knows how to make a mean lambic and geuze.
Duivelsbier van Halle;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;(33cl bottle thanks to bu11zeye) clear rich amber with soapy tan bubbles. Nose is very muted, brown sugar, not much else here.

Schlafly Smoked Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter - Smoked;Saint Louis Brewery;"9/17/2012: Sampled on tap at the 2012 Schlafly Hop In The City festival. It poured a nice clear, deep brown color with lasting beige foam. Faint malt, tangy hops, and fruity ale yeast esters. Struck me as a mild or brown ale, too thin and weak to call porter. The ""smoke"" aspect tasted artificial like that liquid smoke stuff they sell at the grocery store. Not a very good beer. 01/30/2015 UPDATE: Tasted again at their Taproom. Definitely smokey, but in a natural way, and not overpowering. Well-suited to the toasty and roasty porter traits. Some malty and caramelly sweetness balanced by nice earthy hops, with a fairly dry finish. Good appearance, aroma, flavour, mouthfeel, an all-around well-crafted beer. Infinitely better than I remember their 2012 version."

Schlafly Belgian Dubbel;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Dubbel;Saint Louis Brewery;Tasted on-tap 9/17/2011 at the Hop in the City Festival in a clean half-pint taster glass. Good reddish-brown American ale, but not a great Belgian dubbel. Lacks the strength, complex flavors, high carbonation due to secondary fermentation, and the fine lacing of better examples. It’s no Trappist, and not really a style to just dabble at, but I could nonetheless drink several of these at a sitting.
Schlafly Belgian Dubbel;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Dubbel;Saint Louis Brewery;Enjoyed on tap at Schlafly Tap Room in St Louis, MO as part of a sampler. Appearance is like apple juice, cloudy dark amber with apple-like hue and not much of a head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, mix of assorted fruits including raisins and maybe plums. This is the 5th one I’ve tried in 10 min so my palate may be a bit busted right now, but it smells good! Taste is centrally dominated by Belgian yeast and hints of clove with that complex fruit element of raisin, and dark cherries. Really good one, Schlafly doesn’t disappoint!
Schlafly Belgian Dubbel;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Dubbel;Saint Louis Brewery;It poured an orangish color, with a thin head. The aroma was hoppy with sweet fruits. The flavor was apricots, fruit, spice, malts, and a grassy finish. A very decent belgian dubbel.

Schlafly Belgian Dubbel;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Dubbel;Saint Louis Brewery;Draft at the Taproom. Reddish brown, looking more like an American Brown Ale.

Served quite appropriately at cellar temperature. Large-bubbled somewhat uneven head. Deep amber/brown color, clear. Some faint sweetness and yeast in the aroma. Flavor profile has some light fruitiness, butter, apple, and red grape (all stemming from the malt, no doubt). Some garden-y, piney hops round out the finish, along with a bit more complex malty, caramel sweetness. Light, creamy mouthfeel. Decent complexity, and a pretty tasty brew.

Schlafly Munich Dunkel;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Saint Louis Brewery;Tasted on tap at Bottleworks in a lager glass. It poured a clear, deep reddish-brown color with weak white head but lots of nice lace. Toasty and roasty aromas, also freshly-cut grain, faint black pepper likely from German noble hops and lager yeast phenols. Flavor was tart, crisp and grainy, very fresh, toasty again but not exactly bready, with a nice bittersweet balance. A hint of vague, burnt fruit syrup, sticky on the tongue. Otherwise a thin, light body, and I agree with vyvvy about the true-to-style mineral water and surprisingly dry impression. A tasty, highly drinkable dark lager. Recommended.

Schlafly Barleywine;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Louis Brewery;Re-reviewing the 2011 bottled, non-barrel aged version. 2011 edition from the bottle. Served in my 20oz imperial pint glass from Schlafly. Pours a gorgeous amber-copper color, a little cloudy with tons of very fine rising bubbles, a good one finger head that lasted forever and left nice lacing. Smell is excellent on this bottle, great fruitiness, gobs of malt, leather and tobacco, no alcohol on this batch, just plain wonderful, I can’t stop sniffing the glass. Taste is very, very good. I think the 2011 batch is the best I’ve had yet. There’s a lot of the same characteristics from the smell, especially the fruity flavors, the pungent maltiness, and some great bitter hop balance. Mouthfeel is a bit on the dry side for a barleywine, but the carbonation is silky and smooth, and it’s pretty drinkable. There’s a notable alcohol warming that finishes you off as you put this one away. Definitely a stay-at-home bottle of barleywine. You might not even get out of your chair after this one. Although it’s august right now, this is definitely more of a winter sipper. Even though this bottle is less than two years old, it’s excellent. I suspect it could age forever and still remain excellent, but I was in a barleywine mood and this was what was on hand, so I drank it. Once again, I am not disappointed. Schlafly’s premium bottles have never disappointed me, and they certainly make an excellent barleywine too. I think that either Schlafly’s barleywine is getting better every year, or I’m liking barleywine more and more every year, or possibly both. Why ask why? Just enjoy it. This ain’t no punk beer, so barleywine fans look out, and everyone else beware.
Schlafly Barleywine;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Saint Louis Brewery;draft... medium bright brown body, no head at all... a very sweet barleywine that’s too easy to drink at 10% but no balance makes it a skip for me

Schlafly Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Saint Louis Brewery;Average beer, below average for the style. The best part is the appearance and pour. Aroma isn't that great.

Vieux Foudre Faro;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Bottled, drank in Brussels in 1995, Yellow colour, white head, nice sweet and sour nose. This was a good Faro with a sweet taste, I prefered the Pertotale Faro from Boon, but still it was a good one. My version hs 5,5% abv.
Vieux Foudre Faro;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Vintage 1990 - sampled 2006 at Le Bier Circus in Brussels. A hazy amber beer with a nice brown head. The aroma has notes of caramel as well as dust and cork. The flavor is lovely acidic with just a hint of sweetness and notes of wood, cork, and caramel. The cork notes made it stand out as somewhat old (no wonder), and my wine loving companion didn’t like it due to the cork, but I found the cork mixing in with the rest and to give it even more character. I really enjoyed the sourness, the years have eaten the sugar and made a single vintage gueuze?!? or is that a carbonated lambic? anyways a lovely beer.
Vieux Foudre Faro;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Bottle-Vintage 1990@Bier Circus, Belgium. Very well balanced, and has a touch of sweetness, that blends well with the slight musty sourness. Woody acidity, with some caramel flavours, which were, again, balanced by the juicy acidity. The balance was great in this one.
Vieux Foudre Faro;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Bottle courtesy of madsberg. Vintage is 1990. Amber body with a small off-white head. Nose is wet wood, green apples, damp earth tones, fallen leaves during autumn and some sweet-sour aromas. Taste is mostly sour but has minimal sweetness throughout. Light wood, sour fruits, declining sugary notes, and earthiness. Very tart at times! Some lemon juice coming thorugh as well. Body is very tart and acidic. Bitter notes, and light culminating is a dry finish. Ends with sour fruits, light earth, damp wood, and light sweetness. Not bad!
Vieux Foudre Faro;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Bottled @ Le Bier Circus: (Vintage 1990) Amber coloured. Light brown head. Sour, fruity and earthy brew. Is very gueuze like and lacs the usual sweetness in the faro. Sour, sour, sour and very grapish. Light astringent. Is dry and salty in the end with a slight touch of fruitiness.
Vieux Foudre Faro;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;Vintage bottle (1992?) from Le Bier Circus, Brussels. Pours dark amber orange with a small white head. The aroma is dominated by an extreme wet woody note, smells like an old boat. Not unpleasant, but definately cellary. Flavor is tart dominated by wood and grapefruit with a musty note. The age is shinig through, but it hasn’t become bad. Soft mouthfull. A nice experience, but imo not much of a faro as the sugar is too insignificant.
Vieux Foudre Faro;Halle, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Vanderlinden;(Bottle 75 cl) 5,5% ABV according to my label. Light brown, a bit flat with almost no head. Classical Faro with candy sugar added to a lambic base. The sugars never overpower the tartness from the lambic making this an old-fashioned and very quenching drink if not exactly refined. Vander Linden were never known for their sophisticated label art - this definetely is no exception! 310398

Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);From Oct 2007 This pours from 12oz bottle a clear amber gold with a large head of foam that shrinks to a fine layer and it has some lacing. The smell is malty and slightly fruity. The taste has notes of sweet malt and grain and it has some hoppiness near and through the finish...hmmm. Pretty weird tasting for the style and the more sips I take the less I like what is going on here. It *has* to be the over abundance of sweetness that is making me enjoy this brew less than it could. The body and carbonation are medium which is nice but I just can't get into the flavours. I'll probably not buy this again but keep on experimenting A-B.
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This was my least favorite out of the craft beer sampler case. First the aroma was like an old pilsner with metallic hints. Unfortuneatly the taste was pretty similar to the aroma. Overall this wasn’t a good beer and i wont purchase it again. Originally rated on 11/28/08
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);The head is has a slightly off white color and it builds up thick and foamy. It slowly fades down to a wispy thin layer that just hangs on until the end. There is very little lacing to speak of. The body has a light golden amber color with very good clarity. Its aroma is light and has a sweet grainy character with a very mild hop presence. The flavor has a simple light grain and mild sweetness with a good balance of earthy and floaral hops. The texture is smooth and slightly slick with mild carbonation. Its body is about medium.
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);The word that most describes Michelob Marzen is ’balance’. The beer displays everything expected from the style without being exceptional at anything. It is very smooth, a little hoppy, and pleasant and drinkable.
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This Marzen from Michelob is a good place to start if you’re looking to try an Oktoberfest beer. It pours a medium amber color with a semi-weak scent of spices. Upon tasting it has a mild taste of spices like clove and cinnamon that drinks rather smooth. This beer would greatly be improved with a little more texture and spices. Not one to rave about, but it is decent.
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12 oz bottle pours yellow with a white head. Aroma and taste of caramel malts. Pretty basic beer.
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle. Pours clear copper with a nice off-white head. Aroma of off malts with hints of caramel and grain. Thin and watery a slight sweet malt flavor. Metallic finish like most A-B products with a hint of grass/hay. Not horrible but not much to like.
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Tasted from bottle into nucleated pint glass. Poured a clear copper color with creamy white head which quickly dissipated, no lace. Faint aromas of rich German malt, noble hops and fruity fermentation. Flavor was malty-sweet balanced by hops bitterness and perhaps some roasted barley. Flavor hinted at bread, toast, brown sugar, toffee. Light body and somewhat watery mouthfeel, dry lager finish. Not as much body, complexity, or alcohol as a true Oktoberfest/Märzen, but still tasty. Probably one of Anheuser Busch’s better offerings.
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);(12oz bottle thanks to Mora2000) clear pale yellow with a film of thin bubbles. Nose of socks, apples and grain. Taste of sweat, butter, and apples. Crisp carbonation with an odd/bad linger.
Michelob Marzen;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Clear amberish with a small head and an aroma of light caramel malt and the taste of a caramel malt (as opposed to adjuncts) budweiser. Thin bodied. Basically a serviceable macro.

Herold Černý Ležák (Bohemian / Czech Black Lager) 13°;Breznice, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Herold;Velké překvapení pro mne bylo, když jsem projížděl TOP50 kategorii Dunkel/Tmavý a nalezl jsem na čtvrtém místě pivo z velkého pivovaru z ČR. Úplně jsem tomu nevěřil, ovšem teď se právě přesvědčuji, že je to pravda. Pivo si nic nezadá ani s Černou sviní, ani legendárním Flekovským ležákem. Vůně i slad je sladce kávová - přirovnal bych to asi k naší Kofile. Tělo plné, v chuti opravdu jen příjemně lehce pražený slad, lahodné doznívání, které by šlo srovnat s Guinnessem, i když je to stále český černý silný ležák a v rámci kategorie splňuje naprosto vše. Vzorové pivo této kategorie. Za 24kč za půllitr v pivotéce? Smekám. Nejlepší pivo cena/výkon v České republice.

M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);24 ounces of pure malted liquor. hey soos. Moon juice. This is nutters. Seriously just grape drank overload. I like it, but more of a desert malt liquor. You guys every listen to Daughters? They were chaotic kind of metal laser guitar shit. Now they just sound like The Jesus Lizard sped up. I can deal.
M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);24oz can pours clear thin gold with thin near white head. The mild aroma seems to be a mix of floral hops, lime, green apple and a sliver of chemical booze. The taste isn’t all that bad really. I get lime and a bit of slightly moldy lemon mixing with some floral hops and grainy cereal like maltiness. It only gets modestly boozy and just slightly chemical like into the finish along with a little earthy, gravel like earthy funk and a touch of mold. Not too hateful. The ABV, if it is actually 8.2% is very well hidden.
M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can. Medium head with medium duration. Color is pale golden. Aroma and taste are malt, flowers and citrus.
M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can at American-can tasting Sdr. Borup. Frothy white fair mostly deminishing head. Dark yellow colour. Light malty and hoppy aroma. Light bitter not very pleasent flavor. Short finish. Watery palate. Not very good.
M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can. Clear yellow with small white head. Flavour is malt, sweet and a surprising little alcohol flavour.
M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Sampled at Cellar’s Wine & Spirits in St Paul, MN and shared by joebrew. Pours a light golden pale blonde brew with a decent white head that has some good retention and fast dissipating lacing. Aroma of corn adjunct and some Zep toilet bowl cleaner. With my nose curling up after the aroma do I really want to taste this? Oh well... Taste is medium bodied, flavors of white Wonder bread (without the crust) chemically infused texture with some citrus. Finish is metallic, semi-sweet with an aftertaste of anti-freeze/battery flavor. Man, I can’t believe I killed off and wasted a few brain cells on this swill.
M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Mmmmmmmmmmmm. Piss golden color, with a little smelly white head. Smells like cleaner and corn, and tasts like sweet like corn and crap. Not as bad as some, but definately bad.
M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);From a can Into a chilled mug: Pale gold with a frothy, egg-white head. And what’s this....lacing! I kid you not. Aroma of alcohol-soaked white bread and maybe just a touch of gasoline. Sweet and alcohol on the front and a weird, sweet-chemical aftertaste. I feel the warmth of the alcohol after 4 drinks. You can do far worse in the malt liquor dept. than this stuff.
M-X;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"Can. Someone tell Kellog’s that some done stole some of their corn flakes, ’cause this beer reeks of ’em as soon as the can is opened. Seriously. A lot descriptions by myself and others say something to this effect: ""Smells like corn flakes..."" but this beer is the real deal. Pours clear yellow with a head that would make Ron Jeremy insecure. Flavor is dulled sweet tarts and stale sugar. I’ll probably lose 25 IQ points by drinking this, and I don’t think I have all that many to spare to begin with. I’m sorry this was ever made. Well, the beer buzz is kinda cool, but other than that... nothing."

Postbrauerei Postillion Hefeweizen;Nesselwang, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Postbrauerei Nesselwang Fam. Karl Meyer;Die Postbrauerei Allgäu gibt es leider nicht mehr. Das Bier wird bei Zötler gebraut. Die Farbe ist rehbraun, sehr hefe- und eiweißtrüb. Es bildet sich eine enorme Blume. Das Weizen riecht intensiv nach Hefe und Banane. Der Körper ist mittel vollmundig und gut rezent. Der Geschmack enttäuscht dann ein wenig, weil er etwas dünn ist. vom Geruch bleiben nur noch leichte Banane und Hefe übrig. Das ist genau mein Weißbier-Geschmack wie ich ihn mag. Der Nachtrunk endet dann noch etwas dünner. Das ist schade, vom Geschmacksprofil her toll aber mehr Körper hätte ihm gut getan. Danke an den Kostverächter für das Geschenk.

Tauras Tradicinis;Vilnius, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Vilniaus Tauras (Royal Unibrew);Boks fra sjappa på hjørnet, delt med Kitty på hotellrommet i Vilnius, etter fin tur til Trakail: klar gylden med ok skum. Forsiktig og uinteressant aroma og smak av malt, humle og milde urter. En helt forglemmelig forfriskning.
Tauras Tradicinis;Vilnius, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Vilniaus Tauras (Royal Unibrew);Tap. Clear pale golden color. Small size, white head, stays. Grainy, milky, sour, hop extract in aroma. Doesn’t smell good. Really grainy, hop pellets, straw and bit papery in taste. Grainy and hop pellets in aftertaste. Tastes fine. Fizzy carbonation.

Aroma of sweet corn, light hop. Very sweet, no bitterness. Medium body, sticky sweet texture, average carbonation. Better than average for the style.
Tauras Tradicinis;Vilnius, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Vilniaus Tauras (Royal Unibrew);Faint corny/hoppy aroma, rather pale in appearance,weak in taste, and thin in taste--this is not an SPL, a style i actually rather like, but a PL with a touch more alcohol. It’s drinkable but not enjoyable (19.2 oz can, supermarket, Vilnius)
Tauras Tradicinis;Vilnius, Lithuania;Pilsener - Imperial;Vilniaus Tauras (Royal Unibrew);Average grainy lager aroma. Medium bitter taste, with an interesting spicyness going on as well. Touch of booze in the aftertaste.
Vestfyen Danish Pride;Assens, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;Denne pilsner har et klart gyldent udseende med et medium hvidt skum. Øllen har en maltet aroma og smager sødt og maltet med en bitterhed. Lidt kedeligt smag. Medium karbonering.
Vestfyen Danish Pride;Assens, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;0.33 can. Clear, gold color and a small, white head. Aroma of pale malts, yeasts, DMS, and grains. Taste is sweet, malty, tacky, DMS shines through again.A light body, a thin texture, and an average carbonation. Finish is boozy, malty, and DMS-y. Overall, a very shitty brew - then again malt liquor is like that by default.
Vestfyen Danish Pride;Assens, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;Can from ALDI, Copenhagen (as Uglens Danish Pride) – clear golden yellow pour with quickly dissipating white head. Aroma and taste is corn, rough grassy and grainy, white bready malts, metallic notes, over fizzy and overt sweet. Not an enjoyable experience.
Vestfyen Danish Pride;Assens, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;En ret almindelig pilsnerøl. Den er lidt syrlig i det og har ikke så meget humle i smagen.

Vestfyen Danish Pride;Assens, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;0,33 l can bought at an danish ALDI market for 5,95 dkr. Labeled as Uglens Danish Pride. Pale golden in the glass, small white fast fading head. Taste starts with malt and grain, corn, some sweetness. Little bit alcoholic bitterness in the aftertaste. Not as bad as the beers yesterday under the same branding but nothing special.
Vestfyen Danish Pride;Assens, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;Moderate hoppy aroma. Foam poor. This lager is sweet, without the sweetness derived from malt. The label says that it is glucose syrup and it is used in small amounts too abundant for my taste. In fact, there are used so plenty syrup that hop bitterness is almost hidden. Malt is partially replaced by corn, so this is a good example of how boring beer should taste. I would think that brewery’s only purpose was to pump a high percentage of alcohol in the beer, and it is managed very well. There is hardly any brewmaster that can be proud of this beer.
Vestfyen Danish Pride;Assens, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;"Copenhagen 30/5 2015. Very red can which together with the name makes you think you are about to digest the Danish Defense Leagues favourite beer. Pours pale yellow with white head. Aroma is malty sweet and with very distinct smell of alcohol. Fizzy carbonation. Taste follows the nose and is dominated by a boozy sourness. This does not seem to be ""the wise choice"" as advertised on the can. Unless you only go for the alcohol percentage."
Vestfyen Danish Pride;Assens, Denmark;Pilsener - Imperial;Bryggeriet Vestfyen;Can 330ml @ Sommerhus Pours clear golden with a white head. Aroma has notes of malt, grain, floral and hint of alcohol.

Mélusine Korlène;Chambretaud, France;Brown Ale;Mélusine;Pression@Versailles, France. Brown beer with a reasonable head. The aroma is mildly malty and roasted, and the flavour is malty and gently bitter with some roastedness. Overall a nice French amber style of beer.

Nose is heavy and very interesting, massive liquorice, Christmas spice, bay leaf, leaves, liquorice malt, heavy,… Taste feels bit empty after the nose, very sweet malt, syrup, herbal, liquorice but also bit weak, soapy leaves. Soapy malt, dry leaves finish body. Far better than the score on here suggest, more interesting at least.

Troutbrook Winter Brew;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Please note that on my older reviews I used a 100 point scale. To make up for any scoring discrepancies, all palate and apearance scored are assigned a neutralized 3/5. Undated 2001?: This beer smells like a Christmas tree and is very bitter tasting. It reminds me of a wooden baseball bat. Not something I’m likely to drink again.
Troutbrook Winter Brew;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Dark reddish-amber, clear. Little head. Cookie-sweet aroma. Flavor of honey and raspberries, bland & weak. Thinnish, watery finish.
Troutbrook Winter Brew;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Clear body with minimal white head. Aroma is sweet, pine/floral hoppiness. Taste is sweet and floral hoppy, very smooth despite the bitterness.
Troutbrook Winter Brew;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;A decent brew. The waiter likened it to the Harpoon Winter Warmer, but it wasn''t quite that good. Still, a good winter offering. Draught at brewhouse.
Troutbrook Winter Brew;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;On tap at GIBF in Providence RI: Light golden amber hue. White head.

Troutbrook Winter Brew;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;I had this in the summer, so maybe I'm missing something. I liked it better than the summer beer, but it still wasn't tickling my tastebuds, so to speak. There's really nothing special about this that sets it apart from the hundreds of other winter and pale ales.
Troutbrook Winter Brew;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;"Aroma of pine and Goldings hops. Nice clear light amber body with a frothy white head. Flavor is piney, citric with notes of Goldings. Points for good hop burps. Lightly roasted and sweet but a dry finish that leaves you thirsty. Tastes like a New England Gold Stock Ale, light. Label on bottle says ""...will stand up to even the coldest New England winter"". Doubtful. It's a decent brew but for a winter seasonal it would be knocked over by Celebration Ale's aroma alone. ---- Contract Brewed by Mendocino Brewing Co., Saratoga, NY"
Fantôme Strange Ghost;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;At RBAG 2018, Winter Edition. Sampled from a 750ml green bottle, corked and capped. Ambeer coloured with a thin white cap. Nose - lime and mint, herbal, berries. Taste - sour berries, herbs, lime. A touch of sourness at the end. Weird but cool as a I would expect from Fantome.

Aroma is mint, earth, leafy, some funk. Palate is some toothpasty mint, some tart key lime, some acidity, some weirdness. I fucking hate mint!
Fantôme Strange Ghost;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;Much darker then I thought it would be. Mint, lime, and something I can't pin down on the nose. Bulldogops is right - some toothpaste! Mint and lime again. Bit of hops. Fucking weird.
Fantôme Strange Ghost;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;750mL bottle. Pours a brownish red with a moderate beige head. Aroma is plum, raisin, yeast, funk, mint, earth, and herbs. Taste is raspberry, plum, some funk, spice, a little chocolate, some raisins, flowers, some earth, and a tiny bit of mint in the finish. Medium body. Medium carbonation.
Fantôme Strange Ghost;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;Very interesting beer. Poured with a large foamy short-lived can head.

Fantôme Strange Ghost;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;Pours a brown color with a foamy off white head. Notes of roasted chestnuts, funk, and something herbal.
Fantôme Strange Ghost;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;On tap at The Sovereign in DC. Pours a clear red with a medium offwhite head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is slightly vinous and pretty herbal. Taste is gently tart and some pretty distinct cardamom notes. Body is medium, carbonation moderate. Refreshing. Vinous.

Fantôme Strange Ghost;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Fantôme;Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Aroma is odd with a light chocolate and coffee roast note. Some toasted bread as well as toffee and nuts. Very herbal and phenolic with what smells like mint, allspice and pepper. Light citrus, raisin and fig notes. Pours a brown color with amber hues and a medium large, moderately thick and frothy, tan head that recedes somewhat quickly to a thin film that lingers on the edges. No lacing or legs. Flavor is better than I was expecting. Moderate malt notes with some toffee, nuts and toasted bread. Hints of chocolate and roast. Some light raisin, fig and prune notes. Light acidity and medium low bitterness. Medium light mint notes with lighter allspice, pepper and clove. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, a better beer than I was expecting base don the aroma. While it is weird, the beer kind of works and the herbal notes are lighter in the flavor than in the aroma. One thing I really like about this and other Fantome beers is how the acidity, while present, is nowhere near as strong as in some of the popular American saisons.
Fantôme Pissenlit;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison/Farmhouse - Flavored;Brasserie Fantôme;Dark gold, like a dehydrated person's pee. Huge, thick head. Very herbal, slightly astringent. Full bodied. Bottle from the Rare Beer Club.
Fantôme Pissenlit;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison/Farmhouse - Flavored;Brasserie Fantôme;750 corked bottle from Molly's. This is a copper beer, a little darker than I expected, with a tall head. Very expressive yeast imparts aromas of pineapple, cobwebs, pepper, and plums. A touch of bready sweetness gives some heft to the flavor. There might be a touch of Vienna or Munich malt. The finish is almost tart. Very fruity, pineapple suggestions are ever present.

Gingerbbread, notes of dandelions, almonds, marzipan, christmassy spices in the aroma. Almonds, baked apples, not so sweet marzipan, toffee, dandelions (grassy freshness), caramelly, bit malty notes. Slightly bitter finish. Marzipan, floral notes in the aftertaste. Rather light bodied, very well balanced, extremely surprisingly well balanced and tasty brew. Wow. Saison that perfectly fits with desserts but stays fresh and crispy.

Clear golden with just a slight chill haze.Appears immaculately clear when comes up to temp, and boasts a creamy white cap. Sugary, candy like raspberry aroma with not much else. A bit of grain. Sweet, but not overly so, slight crispness can be mistaken for acidity. Creamy palate. Light bodied and nice for what it is.
Pepperwood Framboise;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;On tap at the bistro. Aroma is mostly raspberrys but not much else. Taste is very similar. Nothing special.
Pepperwood Framboise;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Smelt quite nice actaully. It was a good raspberry aroma but it lacked the raspberry taste. It was a clear colour, looked similar to a bud light lime or something. Little carbination remained. It was a light beer with a small raspberry taste. It was ok but nothing I would go out of my way to have again
Pepperwood Framboise;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Clear golden. Bright fruity nose warns of soda pop. Aroma has dull pale malts and husks in background. Highly carbonated. Grainy tapestry suggests this could be the cream ale with a raspberry syrup added.

Pepperwood Framboise;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;[562-20070824] Tap @ Pepperwood (Burlington, ON). Tart raspberry aroma. Clear, brown amber body with a quick off-white head. Leafy raspberry flavour has a wheat background. Medium body. Fair.
Pepperwood Framboise;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Jammy sweet raspberry aroma doesn’t offer much character from the base beer beneath. Clear golden body is topped by a low, fine bubbled white head that recedes rapidly to the slightest ring but does leave some lacing. Overly sweet flavour is offset somewhat by some grainy malts and a hint of tartness from the fruit. Light body is rather watery in texture with moderate carbonation. Sampled on tap at the brewpub.

Pepperwood Best Bitter;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Had both the cask version and the dry hopped version. Scores in the header are for the dry hopped version, with scores for the cask summarized at the end. Both versions are a deep golden with medium-to-low carbonation and a thin white head, with the cask version being slightly hazier (of course) with slightly less carb. Aroma is lots of citrusy hops and hints of grass overtop crusty malts. Cask more bready and the dry-hopped with stronger grapefruit notes. The dry-hopped is sweet and almost honey-like in flavour, has lots of citrus and bready goodness, finishing relatively bitter. A more subdued toastiness, additional fruitiness, woody notes and mild bitterness characterize the cask. Mouthfeel is full and juicy for the dry-hopped, with a light bodied, mineral-like quality being apparent for the cask. Cask: Aroma 7, Appearance 3, Flavour 7, Palate 3, Overall 14
Pepperwood Best Bitter;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Dry-hopped version. Clear golden with thick white head. Fresh, bright tropical fruit hop aroma with hints of orange and pineapple. Soft, gentle and smooth carbonation.

Dry hopping evident in aroma - strong hop forward nose. Taste -is unbalanced - strong hops cover up a pretty thin light malty body. I like my hops but by the end this balance did not do it for me.

Pepperwood Best Bitter;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Focus on citrus hops is apparent in the aroma with pleasant underlying malt base. Clear copper coloured body is topped by a low white head that recedes to cover. Decent bitterness is supported well by malty base. Unexciting but very drinkable. Light fruitiness and a hint of butterscotch offer counterpoints. Medium light body with moedium carbonation. Sampled on tap at the brewpub.
Pepperwood Best Bitter;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Sample at the brewpub with Rastacouere, Olivier_MTL and tiggmtl. All four samples were light amber-blonde, virtually no distinction in color or clarity (fairly clear), just a bit in the heads perhaps...this one has significantly more head and lace...some buttery qualities in the nose don’t really detract from the light aromatic pine needles...body nicely balanced between sweet pale malt and dry floral/sprucy hops...clean and refreshing, probably the best of the four I tried.
Pepperwood Best Bitter;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Great lacing ponctuates the white head which tops the clear golden-amber body. Obviously dry-hopped floral hops nose. The malts underneath strike as highly grainy and uninteresting though. Limited bready and husky malts contrast vastly with the leafy finishing, wholly floral hops, dedicated. Very light bodied, but this works well here while the carbonation is soft and excellent.

A surprising amount of roasted maltiness, with no hint of dark fruit. Body is very thin, which accentuates the astringency and bitterness. Seems like it’s brewed from extract.

Has some strength, but not quite an imperial which is usually too sweet for me. Light brown/orange clear appearance. Not too heavy on the caramel malt. Glad to try different ones in this style around this time of year. If it was regular strength, would be forgettable, but for 7.3% and decent quality, I'd consider buying again.

I have to admit, I have never been a porter guy..but man, the comments on this beer are so brutal. The overwhelmingly cocoa powder scent is kinda a tell that they might added too much other ingredients just to cover some shortcomings of this beer, but overall, I still think this beer deserves better than a sub-par rating.
Tommyknocker Cocoa Porter Winter Warmer;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Porter - Flavored;Tommyknocker Brewery;Smells of cocoa powder. Dark brown pour with light brown head. Taste is watered down hot cocoa, oatmeal, oxidized chocolate, toast, and kind of protein powder.
Tommyknocker Cocoa Porter Winter Warmer;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Porter - Flavored;Tommyknocker Brewery;Originally rated on 12/17/08. Let me start with the aroma, at first it was a pleasant cocoa, and i thought about rating it an 8 but as it warmed it took on an earthy smell which i normally like but this was reminding me of manure you buy for gardening. which is a 2 so I gave it a 4. At first i really liked it but the more i drank the more that nasty aroma took my attention away from the average flavor. I am glad i got a single and not a sixer.

Darkish amber colour. Served ice cold so difficult to get much aroma and the fact I was harbouring a mighty thirst meant it didn’t hang around long enough to warm up. Some modest hops in the flavour.

While the common RB northstar is a golden, drinkable, but light in flavor that I’ve had many times, this was an example on when an expert brewer (Jerry in Boston RB) hand crafts a small batch. Much darker and thicker appearance, much more flavor, much smoother palate, a bear that you could drink on and on...but sadly the cask was a one-time thing.

5 Seasons Me262 Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Appearance: Clear, middling amber-hued body with a modestly-sized, white head. Smell: Sweetish and bready on the nose, with a faint background note of finely-ground spice. Some orchard fruit lovingly rinsed in quality alcohol. Taste: Bready malts, tastes of crumpled sugar cookies, and a sweetish akin to golden syrup with a faint backing of light-colored caramel. Earthy spiciness, then a sliver of lemon peel, then a bite of apple and apricot. Ample bitterness. Sweetish and lightly spicy on the warming finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-plus carbonation. The slight boost in carbonation works to cut through the slight stickiness of the mouthfeel. Overall: A bit up there, boozewise, but not bad overall, and a nice brew to start up and close out the annual Sausage Fest at 5 Seasons.

5 Seasons Me262 Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This poured an amber color with a caramel and toffee aroma. Some sugar and caramel in the flavor. The aftertaste is bitter and sweet. Overall a nice beer
5 Seasons Me262 Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub on 6/3/08: Pours a transparent copper bronze with a frothy clingy-lacing off-white head. Aroma of sweet caramely and grainy German malt with some slightly bready notes and light fruity esters. Body starts fairly full and light caramely and Munich malty sweet with a slightly earthy noble hop balance and a semi-sweet authentic finish. An enjoyable Maibock.
5 Seasons Me262 Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Pours a dark, clear coppery color with a decent fine-bubbled copper-cream head. Rich aroma is spicy - cloves and cinnamon - and malty. Mouth-filling malty flavor has an undertone of cinnamon and cloves, as well as hints of caramel and banana. Texture is pleasingly smooth and tingly, and it leaves a nice spicy aftertaste. Earlier Rating: 5/28/2007 Total Score: 4.5 Color is a beautiful clear reddish-brown with a thick head. Aroma is hoppy and has a toffee hint. Flavor has noticeable hoppy and malty components, with nutty undertones and a whisper of toffee or caramel. Sweet and bitter tastes balance very nicely and complement each other. Heartily recommended!
5 Seasons Me262 Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Very malty aroma, that screams bubblegum, and sweet maltiness that follows through into the flavor, rich caramel sweetness, that rides a wave of honey and citrus bitterness in the finish, but does not carry on from there, the finish just drops right off leaving no lingering flavors on the palate. Overall not bad, but not worth writing home about.
5 Seasons Me262 Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Draught @ brewery Very nice malty lager. color is spot on for Einbecker Maibock. Copper not gold like other maibocks. I don’t get the huge malt aroma or flavor of a bock, nor the slight fusel alcohol taste that should be there.
5 Seasons Me262 Maibock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;5 Seasons Brewing Company;"On top at the restaurant. Clear as all hell (very impressive), with a thin head of micro bubbles. Smells of corn, molasses, and cherry bubblegum. Upon the first sip, I remark to myself that maibocks are usually thicker than this in my experience; lots of unfermented sugars it seems just floating around; smooth; dark grains dominate the middle; subdued citrus fruit throughout, like oranges or kiwi; no lacing, and not much carbonation at all. Warming. You get a bit of hops at the end, but nothing to write about."

5 Seasons Lionheart Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;English style ale rather than the west coast style most of us are used to. Hoppy profile reminds me of rabbit food but not in a gross way. Very herbal aroma. Full flavored, crisp, and refreshing.
5 Seasons Lionheart Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Light orange coloring, almost copper, with an off-white head. This was balanced but pretty boring for a pale ale.
5 Seasons Lionheart Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Clear, bright copper body with a just off-white head. Mild, pale malt nose with little hop aroma. Some spicy hop flavor but the malts still lead and overpower a bit. Slight iced tea character. Boring pale ale.
5 Seasons Lionheart Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Draft. Coppery medium brown pour. Woody citrusy hoppy aroma. Nice malty flavor with decent hopy flavors, and a light to moderate bitter finish.
5 Seasons Lionheart Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Tap, served in sampler glass. A good american pale ale, I don’t know if I buy the mix of IPA and ESB. Good aroma of hops with some malt.

5 Seasons Lionheart Pale Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;The description on the menu was that this beer was a cross between an English Pale Ale and an ESB. I thought they did a pretty good job at it: the balance between malt & hop is good. The aroma is very nice.
5 Seasons Sledgehammer West Coast Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Wow, this one has a nose that just jumps right out of the glass. Fresh hoppy citrus nose, with hints of caramel maltiness. Not exactly big enough to be called a west-coast style, but I don’t want to get caught up in all the coast style bickerings, cause where I live we are above all that. This is still a really good, solid pale, with a bold decoration of hoppiness thoughout, and a solid well-structured malt backbone. Enjoyable.
5 Seasons Sledgehammer West Coast Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;"My Bottom Line: Earthy and citrusy hops bulge out of the well-fed caramel maltiness before a leafy hop bitterness efficiently seals this silky Pale Ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A slice of foam decorates the clear bronzed russet. -The citrusy fruitiness even visits cranberry territory. -Wooden notes also emerge from the hoppy nose. -The overall result is balanced and quite drinkable. -This is perhaps not boldly hoppy enough to be advertised as ""West Coast"" style. On tap at the brewpub."
5 Seasons Sledgehammer West Coast Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Draft. Pours a dark amber. Aroma of piney hops. Flavor was much the same. Lightly bitter finish. I would have preferred a bit more hop bite to this beer. Was a bit underwhelmed with this one.
5 Seasons Sledgehammer West Coast Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;"On tap; color was reddish for the style, but the lighting was not all that great. Aroma was not all that hoppy; mostly floral hops. Not much like a west coast IPA in the aroma, nor in the taste. Decently balanced, but I found it underhopped. Would have liked citrus notes to be more forthright. All in all, I am not sure that this compares at all to a real west coast version of the style."
5 Seasons Sledgehammer West Coast Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On tap at the restaurant. Classic APA hoppiness throughout. I’m guessing here (because I don’t really know what I’m talking about), but what I interpret to be Kent-Goldings on the nose (with easily identifiable C-hops too). The aroma is somewhat flowery, as is the taste. Low malt profile, like an ESB, but with the hop profile of an APA with citrusy as opposed to earthy qualities. Clear, fizzy head of taupe bubbles over a burnt copper beer.

Quite well balanced; recommended."
5 Seasons Sledgehammer West Coast Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Amber colored with a small white head. Lots of hops in the nose. Love the Cascade hops. Very citrusy. More a malt flavor than I expected, but still very hoppy.

5 Seasons Blackbird Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On tap at 5 Seasons. Poured deep brown with garnet highlights and a long-standing, creamy beige head. The aroma picked up a well-roasted impression of semi-sweet chocolate and coffee notes with slightly sour woodsy and black patent notes on the back. The flavor found dry-roasted black and chocolatey malts surrounded by slightly sour oaky and spicy character around.. a touch sweeter on the finish with semi-sweet chocolates and black peppery notes. Medium-bodied and roasty on the palate with moderate carbonation.. drier with an OK flow. Very serviceable porter.
5 Seasons Blackbird Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Opaque with a small creamy head. Aroma of coffee, cocoa and light char. Flavor is similar, with some sweet pecan added. Medium body is smooth and roasty-dryish.
5 Seasons Blackbird Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On draft at North brewpub. Delicious roasty aroma, full of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee undertones. It was served a tad cold and warming the glass really released more aroma. Beer came in glass with minimal crown poured from tap, very opaque. Velvety mouthfeel with prominent roasted flavours up front, hop profile increases then tapers off to a clean finish. Very nice balance and leaves a desirable roasted malt and chocolate aftertaste without any troubling hop bitterness. Very balanced beer and worth a taste if you live anywhere in Atlanta.
5 Seasons Blackbird Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This one had a delicious fresh aroma, really clean, with hints of chocolate and cocoa. Roasty with a nutty coffee-esque flavor, hops come through in the finish giving just the right amount of bitterness.

5 Seasons Blackbird Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;5 Seasons Brewing Company;One of the best brews that 5 Seasons has ever produced, if not their all-time best! It pours a rich, opaque sable with a thick, light tan head. Aroma is malty with a smoky undertone and a hint of coffee. Flavor is rich with undertone of burnt coffee, a peaty hint, and a touch of fruity sweetness. This porter is smooth and scrumptuous. I heartily recommend it to all my fellow stout and porter lovers.

5 Seasons Kounterfeit Kölsch;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;5 Seasons Brewing Company;"This has all the aspects of a German style lager, but none of the aspects that I look for in a Kolsch, even if it is a ""kolsch style,"" this does not hit the mark for me.

5 Seasons Kounterfeit Kölsch;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Draught @ brewery A very clean light lager, but missing the typical Koelsch attributes of a soft flowery aroma and grainy flavor. this is too smooth but a good beer if a bit nondescript.
5 Seasons Kounterfeit Kölsch;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Pours a light yellow color with a white head. Aroma is of light malts with some hop spiciness. Flavor is light malts with a spicy hop finish.
5 Seasons Kounterfeit Kölsch;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This beer is a clear amber, not pale at all, so it looks like real beer. Aroma is scanty.

5 Seasons Kounterfeit Kölsch;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Tap @ the 5. Clear yellow color with a white head. Yeasty and malty aroma with a hint of lemon citrus. Light malty flavor witha light floral taste. Dry crisp bitter finish.
5 Seasons Kounterfeit Kölsch;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Clear gold, thin creamy white head.

Thirst quenching that was a nice example of the style…
5 Seasons Kounterfeit Kölsch;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;5 Seasons Brewing Company;A light colored beer with the standard yellow appearance and little head. A nice malt presence in the flavor and little bit on the sweet side. This is good for a lawnmower beer.

5 Seasons Big Blonde HefeWeizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This looks like a hefe with that hazy funkiness. A lemon grass aroma. Light tart citrus flavor wit some pepper spice, caramel, and that lemongrass again.
5 Seasons Big Blonde HefeWeizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons Brewing Company;I’m not a huge fan of the style but holy crap was this done right.

5 Seasons Big Blonde HefeWeizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Draft 4.5% abv per menu. My notes have murky gold white head. Banana scent. Wheat taste. Very nice Hefe! Not normally my style but really enjoyed this one!
5 Seasons Big Blonde HefeWeizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Appearance: Dispensed a clouded, dull gold body with a scant (from a rather generous pour), white head. Smell: You get your usual hefe notes: clove-scented phenols, banana mash, whole grain wheat bread, a drop of lemon. Taste: A sensible combination of particularly pale and ever tangy wheat malt. Spoonful of sweetish honey spiced with coriander and bit of ground pepper. Minor fruit traces of banana and candied lemon. Light hop character imparting an equally light touch of bitterness. The malts slide back into the foreground, now with more of a bready accent. Drying, wheaty, lightly spicy finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel, while having a nice, slight creaminess to it, could benefit from some more effervescence. Drinkability: A decent hefe, a little more crispness would’ve really given it (and me) a bit more summertime zing.

Small white head with good retention, slightly hazy body, no visible carbonation, one ring of lacing, and a golden hue with some orange tint. The aroma was sweet, wheat, yeasty, clove, bananas, some tart notes, and estery. The flavor mimicked the aroma and tasted very refreshing. A smooth mouthfeel and light-medium bodied. This is a very nicely brewed beer, easy to drink and easy on the palate. Worthy of a try and if I revisit this location, I will definitely drink this if it is available.
5 Seasons Big Blonde HefeWeizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This draft brew from the brewery poured a head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a slightly hazy yellow-orange colored body. The aroma was malty and banana. The very ploesant crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and semi thiick at the finish with a mellow hoppy aftertaste. The mild flavor contained notes of malt mild hops and banana. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
5 Seasons Big Blonde HefeWeizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Tap. Bright sunny yellow with medium cloudiness. White creamy head. Aroma of bananas and a touch of clove. A nice sweet malt of wheat. Creamy body. Very bready. A nice Hefe. .04 apr 08
5 Seasons Big Blonde HefeWeizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;5 Seasons Brewing Company;I would have to say this is my favorite out of the everyday house beers, and generally what I drink when I am in town, not including the specialties and seasonals. Above average take on the style for a domestic craft offering and is reminiscent to me of Schneider. Initially clove and banana notes, and I make that comparison because I think the red wheat does a lot for this beer. Lots of cereal maltiness, with makes me say this would be a great breakfast beer.

5 Seasons Düsseldorf Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Düsseldorf Alt is a dark Alt style beer brewed on the premises of the 5 seasons brewing company. The beer was served to me in a pint glass, and looked dark red to brown with a decent sized head, and good lacing. The aroma was mostly malt, with a sour note to it. The taste was very smooth and managed to be sweet and dry at the same time. The mouthfeel was light, but was too thick to be a summer beer. Nicely done beer with no outstanding qualities, but nothing funky going on either.
5 Seasons Düsseldorf Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Caramel and toffee are the predominant aromas. Nice red-brown body. Watery with a moderately sweetness throughout and a light pepper bite in the finish. Absolutely no acidity whatsoever (nice!). Medium-light body, watery body, lively carbonation. The bottom line is: pretty much spot-on for an Alt though I could live with some more flavor.
5 Seasons Düsseldorf Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;5 Seasons Brewing Company;true to type, not outstanding but very drinkable. It has a mild dryness that many will find appealing and a good one for BMC drinkers in your group
5 Seasons Düsseldorf Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Copper with good head. Mild floral nose. Slightly sweet caramel malt up front, then finishes with distinct hops flavor.
5 Seasons Düsseldorf Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This isn't quite up to par with the excellent alt that Copper Creek brewed earlier this year, but it's also not the boring tripe that so many brewers try to pass off an an alt either. Nice copper-amber body is very clear and topped by an excellent head. Very attractive beer. There's a tad bit of fruitiness to the aroma, but other than that, not much. I was expecting more hop flavor since I've heard the real deal in Germany is pretty hoppy (and the Copper Creek Alt was a nice hoppy beer), but the bittering on this one was very low. This one had to be carried by the malt, which it didn't flop on. Starts off very caramelly with a bit of sweetness, but that gradually fades and I picked up that dry, hay/straw-like malt flavor that a lot of pilsner have. With the contrast with the soft, sweet caramel up front and the dry straw at the end, it made for a little interest where there otherwise would have been none. My father-in-law mentioned that this beer smelled a little like cigars, and I admit there was a bit of that musty smell you get when inside and old tobacco barn that hasn't been used in a while with the dust, decaying wood and lingering aromas of the tobacco that had been cured there decades ago.
5 Seasons Düsseldorf Alt;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Wow! The first rating of this beer. Well its nothing out of the ordinary. Dark orange appearance. Fairly watery palate and flavor. Faint malt and hops are present. A nice little beer that will not offend swill drinkers but not impress lovers of more complex beer. Average

5 Seasons Bavarian Ecstasy Festbier;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Appearance: Pours a clear, copper body with a small, fine, white head. Smell: Sweetish, toasty biscuit nose with a slight, underlying fruit character. Taste: Toasty biscuit malts start things off, then a sugary light caramel taste enters with a Red Delicious apple fruitiness. Light floral, spicy hops and bitterness. Still, it finishes relatively sweet with a lingering yeastiness. Mouthfeel: Just barely medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Drinkability: A pleasant light beer, it would be great in great quantities.
5 Seasons Bavarian Ecstasy Festbier;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Clear copper with a small creamy head. Aroma of caramel and slight corn. Flavor is similar with a light grain and apple touch. Light-medium body is tingly and dryish.

Aroma of bread dough, crackery malts, and light caramel sweetness. Tastes of crisp toasted malt balanced, lightly sweetened crackers. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with the perfect balance between sweet and dry. Moderate carbonation. As American brewers go, 5 Seasons has pretty much nailed the German session lagers.

This is really well done, its really simple and really tasty for what it is. Very clean and crisp on the palate, with a fresh bread maltiness, smoothed out by some spicy bitter hop notes in the finish.

5 Seasons Phoenix Pils;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This is the best pilsner I have ever had! Pours a beautiful golden opaque amber so it looks like honey. Aroma is hoppy with some maltiness and a hint of lemon. Rich flavor has a nice balance of hops and malt, along with a lemony overtone. Aftertaste is very pleasant and smooth. Satisfying and refreshing, this is another winner from Five Seasons!
5 Seasons Phoenix Pils;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On tap at brewpup w/ kleyland. Poured a clear gold with not much head. Aroma was somewhat floral, caramel and spice. Flavor was about the same. Pretty good for the style
5 Seasons Phoenix Pils;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Whiff of sulfur in the nose, pale gold color, creamy sticky head. A little butter in the middel of a light pale malt base. Spicy hop end. Soapy mouth feel. OK for a North American pils, but not so good for the style overall.
5 Seasons Phoenix Pils;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub in July 2006: Pours a lightly effervescent clear golden with a nicely-lacing frothy white head. Mild noble hoppy aroma has a touch of dry earthy pale malt. Body starts with a mild grainy maltiness and a hint of sweet caramel toward a thinner, bitter finish. Drinkable, but uninteresting and could have more of a fresher Saaz hoppy character.
5 Seasons Phoenix Pils;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On draught from keg direct from 5 Seasons. Wonderful pour, lots of healthy creamy crown with excellent retention and lacing. Clear golden yellow appearance. Aroma is floral and herbal with hints of citrus. I picked up some ester and earth tones, as well. Moderately hoppy flavour with a medium bodied palate. Prominent malt backbone balances well in this beer, which I’m usually not a big fan of pilsners. I also detected flavours of wheat, and a sweetness reminiscent of caramel or honey. Crisp and clean finish makes this beer very drinkable. Overall not a bad beer.
5 Seasons Phoenix Pils;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;5 Seasons Brewing Company;tap at brewery. clear, golden pour. thin head. nice lacing. small banana and spice aroma. banana and nice malts and hops. pretty alive for a pils.
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Objectively speaking: Straightforward dubbel which goes off track with its ridiculously overamped carbonation. Whirling the glass does not completly heal it. A bit disappointing as an introduction to 5 Seasons Brewing. I like: Interesting yeast strain matches Belgium’s for its peppery spiciness and fruity ester production. Vinous aroma with prune, caramel and chocolate notes. I dislike: You know it’s going to be overcarbonated from the very nose. Biting, murderous carbonation kills the flavour development. Nothing is left behind this storm. It even fails to produce a decent foam.
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Murky brown pour with a thin tan head. Interesting aroma of caramel, raisins and spices. The flavor isn’t bad, caramel, raisins and spices, but the enjoyment is affected by the boring mouthfeel and the over expressive carbonation.
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Bouteille de 750 ml, avec bouchon de liège, partagée lors d’une dégustation Ratebeer Montréal chez Glouglouburp.

Durée moyenne de l’arrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture minérale. Forte effervescence en bouche. (Rating #1599)
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;In short: Standard Dubbel with standard nutty/caramel flavours. Unfortunately over-carbonated. How: Bottle, 750ml, fresh. Back from Europe tasting session with Montreal crew The look: Cloudy light-brown body with a small beige head In long: Despite a general impression that the beer is a bit lacking in the malt department it still manages to provide pleasant nutty flavours and crunchy caramel. Only a light fruity presence (dark fruits). Finish is a bit peppery. Body is somewhat fluffy and the carbonation is WAY over-the-top. The carbonation really kills the lighter flavours and the beer probably feels less complex than it really is. I haven’t seen so many bubbles since that night in the Jacuzzi after a long day of drinking Lambics.
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This is absolutely one of the finest domestic dubbels I have ever tried. The spices are just right and balanced with the rest of the niceties this beers is offering. Delectable brown sugar and candi flavors, dark fruits and a finish reminiscent of bubblegum. A perfect winter warmer.
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;On tap at the GLB. Poured a dark rich amber color with a little bubble head. Very fruity aroma and taste, but SUPER smooth! This beer was like drinking silk!
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;A beautiful, cloudy, reddish-brown with a nice thick tan head. Aroma is strong, malty and hoppy, with a good alcohol edge and fruit hints. Flavor is exceptionally smooth, more like a fine bourbon than a beer, with hints of fruit and butterscotch. It has a nice alcohol edge to it so you know that it is a high-gravity beer. This is one to be sipped and savored.
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;tap. light brown-purple hue. Big belgian aroma, yeasty. Raisins, dates, plum juice. Lots of sugar in the aroma. Flavors of plums, big malts. Very balanced. Super enjoyable.
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: An inviting doughy, fruity Belgian yeast character permeates the malt’s generous cocoa offering, building a lustful body for this textbook Dubbel. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy sheet of foam dwindles into the cloudy reddish-brown. -The fruitiness is redolent of dates and figs. -This is not the most complex Dubbel, but it is ever so satisfying for lovers of the style. -I was expecting the bottled version to be a tad better than the tap, but its carbonation was so expansive that it marred the body somewhat. Otherwise, the beer was as satisfying. On tap at the brewpub and from the bottle.
5 Seasons Delerium Dubbel;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Burgandy in color, just as advertised. Very sweet smell. The flavor is strong with Belgian esters. Sweet, candy sugar and banana bread. A tad thin is the only drawback.
5 Seasons Transcendental Bock;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;5 Seasons Brewing Company;Had this brew on 7/31/06. It was a bottle conditoned brew from 05. Poured deep mahagany with perfeect head. The nose was malty with a slight roastedness. Taste screamed malt and hinted at hops. This was such a great beer with a slight nut finish. I didn’t know what it had done to me until i stood as well. Great Beer ask for the bottle conditioned beers whenever available.

Timmermans Lambic Doux;Itterbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Faro;Timmermans (John Martin);"Preso dalla caratteristica brocca alla graziosissima taverna ""A la becasse"" e accompagnato a salumi tipici (mentre dietro di noi una coppia di giapponesi aveva il barbaro coraggio di abbinarlo a degli ""spaghetti bolognese"" di dubbia qualità). Di colore ambrato, quasi limpido, la schiuma è pressochè assente. Aroma delicato di malto, fieno, lieve floreale. In bocca corpo leggero, molto dolce, malto, biscotto, caramello, zucchero candito e qualche suggerimento floreale e di uva bianca. Interessante"

Moylans Black Ale;Novato, California, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;Very, very weird beer. Has a bit of roasted smoothness that reminded me of a schwartzbier, but then a surge of fruit and spice comes welling up underneath, forming the unfortunate flavor of back Jellybean. This is one of those interesting beers that capitivates you for the first couple of sips, and then it dawns on you that while you've got a complex ale in your hands, in fact NONE of the flavors taste good. In conclusion: yuck.
