Marston's Sundance;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;Tasted this in the Last Post, Paisley (JDW) in April 2000. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight whif of citric lemon peel in the vanishing aroma. thin watery mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malts give a short digestive biscuit base with tart citric fruit notes of weak grapefruit and lemon. Dusty notes from the hop resins builds up in intensity to give a strong metallic ringing tone in the long aftertaste. Finish is too astringent with no body at all. A poor Golden Ale.

Castle Rock Nottingham Gold;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;"I think I had this beer under 4 different names during one day in Nottingham! They were all quite good though and included the word ""gold"". Well-hopped, highly floral, straight golden brew wearing a full white head. Pleasant, almost tartish, lemony aromas that have a certain perfumey quality to them. Soft bready and grainy background. Grows quite dry and firmly bitter. A fine, fresh and tasty offering at this low ABV."

Blanche de Cambrai;Hordain, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Choulette;Robe dorée, fine mousse. Nez peu typé sur des notes de banane et de céréales. Bouche épicée qui manque de fraîcheur et de complexité. Un blanche à oublier
Blanche de Cambrai;Hordain, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Choulette;Robe laiteuse très trouble, mousse fort correcte, blanche et assez fine. Nez épicé, avec du poivre, très aromatique ! Une pointe citronnée aussi. En bouche, du grain cru, on sent le froment, pointe acidulée, citronnée, légère. Un goût de levure et de coriandre. Typée blanche, mais avec une originalité certaine, due à ce côté épicé étonnant. Facile à boire, légère, agréable.
Blanche de Cambrai;Hordain, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Choulette;Loved it. Reminded me of a good old fashioned German wheat beer. Haze for days in the glass. Small thin head once settled. Hardly any aroma which concerned me at first. Mouth feel was nice, downed well, no bitterness.....massive fruity flavours, banana instantly springs to mind. Purchased online, literally off the hop, but ill be going back for more. If you like your wheat beers...then youll need a 4 pack in the fridge...weekly. Very nice beer.
Blanche de Cambrai;Hordain, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Choulette;Mousse blanche très carbonique partant rapidement, robe jaune pâle voilée par la levure. Très bel arôme, mélange d’agrumes, orange et citron, ainsi qu’une pointe de cannelle. A la dégustation c’est très doux, l’orange et le citron sont bien présents, la pointe d’épice et la cannelle sont légers. C’est une très belle blanche aromatique, elle manque un peu de corps pour tenir sur la longueur, cependant elle ne peut cacher son caractère artisanal, et sa spécificité. Une belle réussite pour cette brasserie. Dégustée en 75 Cl DLUO 03 2017
Blanche de Cambrai;Hordain, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Choulette;Bottled 330ml (BB 01/2017Saveur Biere) Hazy orange color, small white head. Riped banana and grain in the nose. Medium-bodied. Banana, orange peel, bubblegum, not much spiceyness. Watery finish. Boring.
Blanche de Cambrai;Hordain, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Choulette;75cl bottle at home. Now this is a pleasantly looking wheat beer! Very, very hazy, lemon yellow to light brown colour, with on top a thin fizzy, white collar full of carbon. The aromas are very light and subtle - a bit of a shame - but I noticed some herbs, wheat and earth. Maybe some dough too. The taste has little malts, bitterness, lots of fresh lemon water, some citrus zeste and the lemon sourness, herbs. A touch of black pepper as well, yet this features should be maxed. So less water and more pepper notes could make this an excellent white!
Blanche de Cambrai;Hordain, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;La Choulette;"330ml bottle. Hazy, pink-ish, faint golden colour with small, frothy, half-way lasting, minimally lacing, white head.

Westons Old Rosie Scrumpy;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;I like the flat scrumpy one not the fizzy one. It's cloudy, looks like urine but will get you on your back after 3/4 pints! Definitely a favourite of mine due to the crisp apple aroma and tastex
Maumee Bay Double Bock;Toledo, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Maumee Bay Brewing Co.;"Yum; beautiful rubyness; nutty aroma, nice head with everlasting lace. Became enriched with warming. Best Maumee has to offer (which wasn't much)"
Maumee Bay Double Bock;Toledo, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Maumee Bay Brewing Co.;A very pretty red/orange in color with a sweet, alcohol nose to it. Nutty, roast flavor over a maple syrup sweetness. Noticable alcohol taste, not but obtrusive. Nice beer.
Maumee Bay Double Bock;Toledo, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Maumee Bay Brewing Co.;"everything good i know about toledo ohio can be summed up in two words: maumee bay. a great brewpub in a historic building, decorated with a decent beer can collection and buckeye beer brewerania. cute wait staff generally rated about 3.6. i got the doppelbock in a growler: poured saddle brown, a fluffy head so big in a pint glass that a british pub patron would feel cheated. malty, maple aroma. quite sweet, brown sugar. nice body, generous hop. powerful in alcohol, but not as pungently ""bocky"" as spaten optimator. in fact, much smoother and more quaffable. tasty, respectable brew, but you'll want something hoppy next."
Shenandoah Semper Fi Red Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Pours a light amber (not red). Hop/cat pee aroma. Bland, papery flavor. Don’t waste your money/time
Shenandoah Semper Fi Red Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;"Carbonation should be on the side of a milk carton; virtually nonexistent. Mouthfeel was watery and milky. Some hop bitterness surfaces in the finish, but it is a feckless attempt at gaining my attention. Not much in the flavor department; flavoids on strike. Overall, rather disappointing. No nutty roastiness; no sweetness; no rich malt flavors; nor crisply bitter hoppy notes. Just an unbalanced, watery, uncarbonated, boring beer. I feel ashamed to bash it so hard, but I'm being honest."
Kisz Bier Classic Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Pretty standard. Golden pour. Nose and taste is floral bitter malt. Rated 5/19/04
Kisz Bier Classic Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);POurs clear with notes of bread on the nose. It shows a decent amount of crisp malt and hops with a clean finish.
Kisz Bier Classic Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Undated bottle from American Beer Distributors consumed on 9/25/06. Crystal clear, filtered/pasteurized/force carbonated. Still, a rosy peach-copper body is true enough to style and the white head while not particularly well-retained, laces quite resiliently and is maintained at partial-cover. Initially, a very hoppy nose shows off dusty saaz hops, but very aromatic and quite crisp and straw-like as well. Spiciness on the end, and a touch of light honey and dough. Not too much crisp yeast either. Way too much sugar in the flavor, bready, doughy and with a sagging, artificially carbonated texture. Bitterness perks up at the very beginning but is quickly washed out by pale sugars, wateriness and hay flavored hops. Poorly balanced, there is no crisp yeast bite at the end of my bottle. Gets watery very quickly. No alcohol noted.
Kisz Bier Classic Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Found this at some crappy bodega on 14th st. Aroma has that traditional light saaz smell, but I think this was old b/c it had some slight skunkiness to it. Flavor was light sweet malt with some breadiness and a decent hop flavor and bitterness. Pretty cleand and crisp finish but may have been a bit past its prime. Not as good as Staropramen.
Kisz Bier Classic Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Excellent eurolager aroma, but it kinda went downhill from there. Cereal, metallic and malty flavors. Ditto on the finish. Green bottle, lousy label.
Kisz Bier Classic Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Very Smooth,the flavor is great, no aftertaste,I like it....................
Kisz Bier Classic Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);An ordinary, light, watery, fizzy lager. Nothing special...................

Camo Genuine Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;"Appearance: Pours a hazy, light orange-yellow body with a smallish, white head. Smell: The typical sweetish fetor of chemicals and adjuncts but kicked up the notches unknown. This is pretty poor even for a malt liquor. Taste: This is going to be an absolute struggle. Sweetish, harsh flavor of corn, rubbing alcohol, diesel, and the tears of sentient apples. The burn and palate grating mix of crude flavors only increases; unyielding until well beyond the perceived finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: Well, that was definitely horrendous. Why is it the worst beers come in such obscenely large doses?"
Camo Genuine Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;wow. this is rough. gold with a large head. alcohol and white wine aroma. fire palate. paint thinner flavors with a twist of apple juice. ouch.

Camo Genuine Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;Pours a fizzy crisp golden yellow. Aromas of corn, minor hopping, and not much else. Flavor is bland american lager with almost no hops.
Camo Genuine Ale;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Malt Liquor;Camo Beer Company;This is actually the best tasting Camo variant I’ve had(which is not exactly a good thing). This one KIND OF tastes like beer, where as all the other Camos taste like fake whine.

Heartland Indian River Light Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Greenpoint Beer Works;On tap at Heartland, Empire State, NYC. A clear, golden beer with a dense, off-white head. The aroma is butterscotchy, on the corn-ish side, with some pear and generic fruityness in the back. There’s much less diacetyl in the flavor, it’s fruity and with a decent bitterness. Medium body, quite dry on the palate. Lasting bitter finish. Sort of refreshing this one, but not very good anyway. The orange blossoms and coriander weren’t detected. 150624
Heartland Indian River Light Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Flavored - Other;Greenpoint Beer Works;Pale gold beer with a weak white head.

Castle Ranger;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);Sept, 2002: A Kenya beer that won a medal at the International Monde Awards. A strange dried yeast/elephant dung aroma rises from this anaemic coloured product, which doesn’t tempt, but does prepare one for the slightly unusual taste. It is a lager, but very dry and with a beer hoppiness. There is licorice, corn and honey flavours. Some gassiness. A warm after-taste that stops just short of spicy. An enjoyable and interesting drink, but not one that I’ll be trying again.
Castle Ranger;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);Unispiring other than a faint rye character. Other than that it is a rather flawless international lager.

Stary Melnik Temnoe;Moscow, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Kaum darzustellen, wie eklig es ist. Vielleicht wäre die Beschreibung von Melasse und Zucker der beste Vergleich. Ekelhaft und eins der wenigen Biere, die ich nach dem ersten Schluck direkt weggekippt habe.
Stary Melnik Temnoe;Moscow, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Pours out of the bottle in a deep dark colour with steady head and smooth body. Aroma of sugar and caramel mixed with malt. Taste of brown sugar, sweet malt, bread and grains. Very sweet overall - sticky, awful sweet. Not drinkable at all.
Stary Melnik Temnoe;Moscow, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Sticky sweetness (flat cola notes evident, and this bottle isn’t that old--production date 2 months ago in Tatarstan), some toasted malt, almost bizarrely alkaline finish...that said, not terrible (I bet the earlier 6+ % abv version was better, but now it clocks in at 4.6% abv)
Stary Melnik Temnoe;Moscow, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;Clear malty flavor with a slightly burnt nuance and with elements of sweet syrup, fruit and wine. Despite the rather special taste it’s surprisingly pleasant. If you find it’s definitely worth testing!
Stary Melnik Temnoe;Moscow, Russia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovarnya Moskva-Efes;500ml bottle (Rimi, Tallinn) Dark red, brief head. Understated malt aroma - some burntness. Rich toasted malt taste, yes it’s quite stout, but neither chocolatey nor coffee-like. Sticks to the tongue, so a roasted finish. Covers 6.5% very well, helped by a bit of sweetness.

Iceni In The Bag;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Iceni Brewery;Moving away from the Celtic connection with a picture of bags on the front, this new offering from the Norfolk microbrewery claims to be 'brewed smoother for a longer taste', a point worth debating. A slightly sour citrus fruit flavour dominates with a soon vanishing flowery hops bitterness in the aftertaste. There is a very mild malty sweetness in the background. Not an impressive beer at all - it is thin and undistinguished. Nothing stands out - even the sourness is rather shy. In the bag appears to be a good name if you consider that this is not a very bold beer, and is hiding everything away that makes a beer outstanding.
Mongozo Banana;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Les arômes de banane sont beaucoup trop présent, l’aspect visuel est top, malgré un manque sérieux de mousse, mais je n’ai pas eu l’impression de boire un me bière aromatisé mais plus du sirop de banane aromatisé à la bière
Mongozo Banana;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Glas geprobeerd bij Kim en Sander. Het is een troebel geel bier met weinig schuim. Het heeft een banaan achtige zoete geur. De smaak is zoet en bananenpuree achtig.
Mongozo Banana;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;"Bottle in Ethiopian restaurant in Amsterdam, server in a 'traditional' coconu bowl. This is one of the most terrible beer experiences I ever had. This is probably a mix of beer and an extract. The aroma isn't banana, but it smells like banana candies. Taste same; very sweet and very artificial. I could hardly finish the bottle."

Mongozo Banana;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Der Name ist Programm. Das Bier hat einen deutlichen Geschmack nach Banane -und das passt auch. Es ist ein fein natürliches Aroma und schmeckt nicht komisch-chemisch. Die Fruchtaromen passen sich dem hopfigen Körper an. Ein spezielles Bier, das aber nicht schlecht ist.
Mongozo Banana;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Smell - quite strong, banana (duh), some candy, sweet. Foam - medium thick, to thin side, little little watery bit later, some banana notes. Taste - banana, synthetic banana, some weak bitterness, does not go together I think... Generally - nothing special, juicebeer.

Iceni Norfolk Gold;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Iceni Brewery;Bottle. Quite flat and malty. Some light melony type flavours, with a touch of citrus, green hoppyness. Just felt a bit too thin, with a watery edge. I was a little dissapointed.
Iceni Norfolk Gold;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Iceni Brewery;"Pours with a giant white head which eventually settles into something more managable. I had two goes at this - first without the yeast sediment where it was crisp, clean, refreshing and slightly sweet; then with the yeast where it took on a slightly honey and leather tone. This is a lovely beer either way with a faint orange perfume, a twist of lemon in the taste, and a mild bitterness in the finish."

Very good mouthfeel - soft, rounded. Flavouring: sweet fruit and jam notes, plummy finish. Interesting citrus specks amongst some vaguely cakey choc moments.

Iceni Thetford Forest Mild;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Mild Ale;Iceni Brewery;"""Brewed on the edge of Thetford Forest"" this is a great roasty, toasty mild full of twigs and hedgehogs and things that crawl and hoot and peer at you through the gloom. Boiled in a witches' cauldron with dark satanic fruits, then spiced with roots of licorice and the peel of lemons, this is a refreshing burst of flavours - perfect for an autumn or winter lunch-time drink."

Tastes sweet and dry if that makes sense with some peppery splashes. A hint of bitterness emerges as the beer warms. A decent lawnmower brew.
Banks DIH Premium;Georgetown, Guyana;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Banks DIH;Had this in Guyana--this is actually a decent beer, especially given it’s the only beer made in this country generally short on resources. It’s fresh and light (what I like when I’m in the deep tropics) but yet reasonably flavorful.
Banks DIH Premium;Georgetown, Guyana;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Banks DIH;Cool, straight from Guyana, which I thought was an African country. Man, I’m ignorant. Anyway, Pale golden straw color, light fizzy white head. Light hint of grass and a sweetish malt nose. The body is spritzy with a light hop notion towards the back. Not sweet and not unpleasant, very standard international lager with a touch of roasty hops.

Appalachian Anniversary Maibock;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Pours a light caramel-amber into the glass, with an initially eggshell soapy head that diminishes to trace lacing. The nose is of citrus, orange, circus peanuts and grain/spruce-pine/grassy notes. Flavors of caramel, candied oranges and alcohol notes, finishing with a peppering piney bitter. A bit boozy and sticky to the palate, this full-bodied offering is not the best example of the style, but respectable enough to be decent.
Appalachian Anniversary Maibock;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at Capone’s. Poured a golden color with a smaller sized head. Some toastiness, caramel, and some fruits.
Appalachian Anniversary Maibock;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at ABC’s Gettysburg Gateway location. Served in a pint glass, light coppery-brown color with thin white head. Aroma of heavy caramel malt sweetness, nuttiness, toast and earthy/fruity hops. Taste is the aroma notes toned down. Light body, moderate carbonation, crisp with clean finish. Pretty tasty lager.
Appalachian Anniversary Maibock;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);This is one of my favorite Maibocks. Really enjoy the slight alcohol warmth and sweetness from the malts.
Appalachian Anniversary Maibock;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Copper, sweet malty aroma. Soft, creamy with good German hop character with very notable caramel sweetness. A little light, even for a lager lacking some of the body and flavor I would hope. Overall pretty enjoyable.
Appalachian Anniversary Maibock;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Bomber from State Line. Pours a clear amber color with a thin head that quickly fades. Big caramel aroma with stone fruits, faint tannins and a bit of toastiness. The taste is caramel, grain, toasted malts and mild hops.

Appalachian Anniversary Maibock;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Sample on draft this beer poured a dark caramel color with a small foamy white head that faded quickly and left a bit of lacing. The aroma was sweetish table sugar and light golden fruits. The flavor was table sugar, golden raisins, pear, apple, bread and a light boozy presence that worked well. The finish was long and tangy with lingering table sugar and golden raisins. Fairly full bodied. Solid.
Appalachian Anniversary Maibock;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Not a bad maibock, but not one of the best I’ve tasted. The color is a dark golden hue, but the beer doesn’t carry much of a head. The nose is mostly of a caramel and bready malt. The body is smooth and very drinkable. I got some bready and malty flavors, along with some slight hoppiness in the finish.

Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Aroma is heavy on the nectar. Mild carbonation, any aftertaste fades quickly, peach flavor is very natural, not syrupy or artificial.
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;8.4 fl oz bottle. Pours pale orange with no head. Aroma is peachy and dry acidic. Dry, flat malty and slight acidci with a peach flavour swept through. No sweetness. Ends dry and peach flavoured.
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;(bottle at Sun Devil). Pours like a peach colored wine with a thin white head. Aroma of dried fruit and somewhat mediciney. Taste is sourish with some sweet, but not as sweet as I thought it would be. Medium bodied with thin texture. Ok beer, but not sour enough and not one I would get again.
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;I’ll be the first to admit that I was probably way too kind to this one. I’ve had much better lambics, but for some reason I rated this one higher than I should have. Smooth lambic along the lines of Lindemans. A little too sugary. Rated 10/8/04 Originally 4.5
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;I’ve had this in my beer fridge for over a year, not too excited to crack it. Pours a flaccid hazy honey gold with a thin foamy head that vanishes quickly. Not a good start. The nose is nice enough-- peach juice (not candy) with a firm lactic yogurty aroma and subtle musty yeast. This is not the same disgusting candy cooler pseudo-lambic a-la-Melbourne Bros. (although theirs is apricot). Sour peach schnapps flavour, with an acidic lactic tartness in the finish. Again, there are strong lactic undertones here adding complexity. The acidity leads to a dry finish. I am pleasantly surprised!
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Aroma and flavor were more apricot than peach. A little too sweet for my tastes. Thin finish with some alcohol. Wouldn’t try again.
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle. Great aroma, just as the name says. its peach and very appealing. The appearance doesn’t really appeal to me, a little like dirty washing water. Thin lace around the glass. Flavour of peach, alcoholic notes, sweet bitter finish. a little thin. Very much like a cider Not my cup of tea and my first Peach beer.
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Pretty poor lambic actually. And it upsets me because this style gets a bad rap. I didn’t like the aroma, smelled like fake apricot. Flavor was weird, like sweetened peach ice tea. Absolutely zero finish. A bad example of a good style.
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Date: 01/19/2003 Mode: Bottle Source: Murfreesboro clear liguid gold, wonderful sweet aroma of peaches and apracot, light, dry, tart, flavor is too subtle and does not live up to the aroma, Aroma: 8/10; Appearance: 5/10; Flavor: 5/10; Palate: 5/10; Overall: 10/20 Rating: 2.9/5.0 Score: **/4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The score was calculated based upon the notes and an old scoring system."
Cherish Peach;Ertvelde, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Orange with some bubbles. Very sweet aroma of candied peaches. Sweet sugary peach flavor. Not so bad for something so sweet, but it needs more lambic and less sugar.
Iserlohner Pilsener;Iserlohn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Iserlohn;Herber Antrunk, leicht malziger Abgang. Ich wurde von meinem Vater gewarnt das dieses Bier scheiße schmeckt und einen übelen Kater verursacht. Naja ich finde es schmeckt ganz normal, erinnert etwas an Warsteiner. Fazit: Typisches Pils, nicht gut und nicht schlecht - kann man trinken, ist aber kein Spitzenbier!
Iserlohner Pilsener;Iserlohn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Iserlohn;Pale yellow color with a very thin white head that quickly fade out.

Iserlohner Pilsener;Iserlohn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Iserlohn;50 cl Swing-top bottle. Pale golden in the glass, nice white head. Bready-pils-typical aroma. The beer starts nice aromatic, not too sweet, but nice balanced. The mainpart gets a bit sweeter, but still bittering hops are noticeable. Full bodied. The grainy-malty aroma is still there, but fits in well. The aftertaste is slightly sweet, nicely bitter, but still a bit too bready. --> in the swing-top bottle much better than the crown-top version - or they’ve changed their recipe - I remember the latter one being disgusting… --> 12/13/12/12 Old rating from the crown-top bottle: Der Geruch ist süßlich laff. Im Geschmack ist es auch nicht wirklich überzeugend: es ist zwar frisch-hopfig und kaum herb, allerdings total neutral-laff, aber ohne wirklich wässrig zu wirken. --> ziemlich laffes Bier ohne Tiefen Test vom 9.1.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,6,9,6,12,6 - 7,35
Iserlohner Pilsener;Iserlohn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Iserlohn;Bottle shared with McTapps. Interesting pilsner which comes quite quaffy with a decent malty aroma. Definitely a mild surprise as I expected a very bitter end. Nice.
Iserlohner Pilsener;Iserlohn, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Iserlohn;Bottle shared with MichaelBruch. So I don’t really am a big fan of CGP but this one really is enjoyable. The bottle design is different than in the picture, the new label design is more classy and posh. Deep golden in colour, low head, smooth head and no real carbonation. Taste of mild but strong hops, green apples, ripe grains and summer. There is no bitterness at all and so quaffable. Very easy to drink. --- Test from 14th Januar 2013.

Dansk Guld;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;Light golden with a weak head. Both aroma and flavour are sweetish with notes of wet grain, corn and a bit of malt. It’s weak, thin and very boring - but not inoffensive.

Appearance: clear pale amber, minimal lacing. Palate: light-bodied and rather watery. Practically flat, slightly bitter at the finish. Taste: lightly bitter, a pronounced flavour of caramel. Totally lifeless, though interesting taste, maybe a dud bottle. The label is beautiful, a hornbill perhaps?
Phuket Lager Beer;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;Just typical Asian light lager. I only wish local breweries try something else beside lager beer to compete with big Thai beers,!like Singha or Chang beers. Make me feel this is just the same or worse.

Phuket Lager Beer;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;Can from Lub d Patong, drank from a can. Looks probably fizzy and yellow, that I can deduct already from the first sip. Aroma is somewhat grainy, light acidity there. Pretty much same as much going on in the taste. Not particularly interesting but medium boded, some sweetness and not that hoppy or bitter. OK overall, I guess - just another Asian lager.
Phuket Lager Beer;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;San Miguel Thailand;330ml green bottle, filtered, from Beers Of Europe.

Black Tiger;Banmai, Mueang, Pathum Thani Province, Thailand;Stout - Extra / Foreign;San Miguel Thailand;"Bottle. I finally found this beer in Phucket, Thailand. I looked all over Bangkok and Chiang Mai to no avail. I bought a big bottle. It was a rich brown with a light brown head. The label said it was a ""Black Lager."" There was a dry nutty flavor. It was a welcome relief from other Thai beers."

Thai Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Malt Liquor;Boon Rawd;Can. Pours a clear golden colour with a medium rather short lasting white head. Grainy bit sweet aroma with corn. Sweetish grainy and bit maltish flavour with a bitterish grainy finish. Served cold.
Thai Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Malt Liquor;Boon Rawd;33 cL can. Pours clear yellow with a huge white head. Sweet cereal aroma. Quite sweet flavour, not cloyingly sweet but just more than average. Has a minor artificial note. No real bitterness nor malt flavour. Mild finish. Strange brew, not in anyway offensive though.
Thai Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Malt Liquor;Boon Rawd;Canned (thanks tbone_!). Yellow colour, big foamy white head, which disappears quite fast. Hay, sweet maize and some malty hints in aroma. Flavour is sweet maize, hay and alcohol. The alcohol is a lucky thing in this beer, as I feel it hides all the horrors in beneath...
Thai Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Malt Liquor;Boon Rawd;Can (filled 06/2006) Golden color, foamy white head. Corn-like sweetish and papery aroma. Starts sweetish with weak grassy hops. Finishing to alcoholic punch. Unbalanced tropical lager.

Pale yellow colour and clear (some very tiny particles). Fruity and malty flavour. Metallic, softly carbonated, slightly alcoholic and light to medium-bodied palate. 30/12/06
Thai Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Malt Liquor;Boon Rawd;Can. Pale yellow colour with a small off-white head. Sweet malty aroma. Very sweet malty flavor with lots of alcohol. Very sweet malty finish. Too sweet for me.
Thai Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Malt Liquor;Boon Rawd;more alcohol then necessary here, and you know it, i guess that is why it falls into the malt liquor genre. malty sweet slight alcohol ember. not good.
Thai Beer;Bangkok, Thailand;Malt Liquor;Boon Rawd;This beer is an attempt at cashing in on Thaksin’s Thai nationalistic fervor. Thai beer spelled in the Thai alphabet aimed at Khun Thai, whoopee! This is basically crap. Even the lousy Bier Sing in Thailand is better than this crap. The cash in on brainless nationalism is only trumped by Carabao’s adverts for its energy drinks. I would only drink if held in the Bangkok Hilton prison.
Ndovu Special Malt;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);330 Bottle, Mikumi Lodge, Tanzania. Too sweet, water, wrong taste. As far as I remember, the only one beer I could not drink so far.

Ndovu Special Malt;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);2019-01-17. Pale yellow body, small quick off-white head.

Ndovu Special Malt;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);375ml bottle @ Matt's. Pours a clear golden colour with a small white head. Nose is very skunky and vegetal. Flavour is not drinkable skunky vegetables. Light bodied, light carbonation, and a mild sweetness. Wow, this is not good.

Ndovu Special Malt;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);Skunky, but a green bottle so expected. Clear gold with a small white head. Paper and some sweetness.
Ndovu Special Malt;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);"375mL bottle, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma is very skunky, with lots of skunk cabbage, vegetables, and some straw. Flavour doesn't even any redeeming qualities -- tons of skunk cabbage; that's it. Putrid stuff."
Ndovu Special Malt;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);Light amber, bit hazy/murky. Not much head. Malt-ish, some lighter grassy hop notes and light bitterness. Finishes more on the sticky-sweet side, though.
Balimi Extra Lager;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);"The beer of Tanganjika region; ""our beer, our taste"". Full and balanced lager taste, no bitterness at all, enjoyable even warm!"
Bia Bingwa;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pilsener - Imperial;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);I guess the major selling point for this one is its alcohol content, but otherwise it’s just a low qualtiy lager. Scent of alcohol and malt, taste of syrupiness and alcohol, not much head. Kind of okay if you want to get trashed, but basically it’s a Tanzanian malt liquor.
Bia Bingwa;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pilsener - Imperial;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);A hopps beer that will get you trashed nicely of seven or eight with a percentage of 8. A strong beer.
Rhino Lager;Lusaka, Zambia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Zambian Breweries (AB InBev);After living for a while in Zambia, I came to appreciate the Rhino. It’s actually almost drinkable when it’s cold, providing you aren’t too into things like hops, aroma, flavor, mouthfeel..., and the hangovers aren’t nearly as bad as what you’ll get from Eagle. It tends to keep longer than Mosi, meaning you are more likely to avoid that Africa skunky/pee flavor... and you’ll get hipster points for choosing something other than the over-advertised Mosi. At its best, you can almost fool yourself into thinking you’re drinking PBR. Goes pretty well with putrid Zambian cigarettes. This was actually my first choice in Zambian beer... providing it was cold.
Trophy Lager;Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Tanzania Breweries (AB InBev);High carbonation and head retention. Pale straw colour, light flower hop and grain aromas light pleasent flavour, though corn comes trhough and a few other fermentation issues like diacetyl.
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle brought back from L.A. Pale yellow colour, medium white head. Aroma of hay and grass. Thin, carbonated, not very nice.
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);12 oz. Clear, golden with a lasting quarter inch of creamy foam. Nose of burnt tire, honey, and scorched grain. Taste is the same as the aroma, but the skunky tire fades after a short while, so it gets a little higher mark. Light medium body is fairly smooth with carbonation and to the sweetish side, but well balanced. Seems as though it may be better than I expected, and if it wasn’t skunked and scorched, buttered popcorn it would be a pretty damn good lager.
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Clear bottle from a Save-Mart. Pours very pale gold with a creamy/bubbly white head. Light skunky aroma. Flavor is quite bready, tho not in a heavy way, and there’s a lot of noble hop. Barring the skunk it would be pretty decent for a pale lager.
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);"Clear yellow, loose white head. Aroma is OH GOD, THE STANK! THE STAAAAAAAAAANK! DEAR LORD, THAT""S BAD! OH GOD NO! Also, tastes bad, too. I swear, this is the first time I’ve ever tasted chlorine in a beer..."
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Lucent straw, thin lasting white head, thin body, high co2. Aroma: very skunk cabbage. Taste: sweet pale malt, roasted corn, mild vegetal bitterness, skunk cabbage, carbonic acid. I’m surprised there’s even enough hops in here to get this much skunky light-struck flavor. If i was hosting a class on beer off-flavors, this would be my prime example of what happens to pale lagers in clear bottles that orbit the sun a few times on their way to my house.
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Yellow. Corn and light honeyed malts in the nose. Flavoris clean and eatery but the finish is metallic. Not good.
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Light clear yellow pour with a tiny white head. Scent is corn, cereal and musty. Taste is carbonated corn and this time of year might not be bad but there is a metal hint in the after taste that I do not care for...
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);"I just got a whole bunch of ""Beers of the World"" as a gift, and damned if I’m not going to rate these fairly. Pale Lagers get a bad rap here, and they take a ratings hit just because they are PALE LAGERS. Granted, I am no fan of this beer - but I am going to rate it as if it were any other style I just didn’t like. That includes Golden Ales, Lagers and Berlinnerweisses. Anyway, this stuf smells a little skunky - probably because of the bottle. But to be honest, I was surprised it wasn’t MORE skunky. Clear bottle - hello? Anway, the beer itself pours a golden clear, with a piss yellow hue. Right off the bat, this stuff is very buttery aka full of diactyl. Goes too slow on the tongue. Notes of some rotting fruit and a little banana. Finishes cloying. AT the same time, better than Corona. Would go well with a lime to help make it less viscous."
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Tried a sample at Brewfest Tallahassee. Oh boy. Why would somebody copy Corona and make it worse? Skunk and corn. Disgusting.
Caballo Cerveza Extra;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle… Clear, straw-colored lager with a small, fizzy, white head. The aroma is pure skunk – my wife smelled it from across the kitchen – with a little lemon thrown in. Light to medium-bodied with a slick mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor is actually pleasant, much to my surprise. Trends toward the sweet side of balance, but offers light acidity and mild bitterness. Crisp, clean finish.

Tröegs Sunshine Pils;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottle - from sampler pack. Light in color, clear. Light, hoppy aroma. Pretty good - decent hop flavor, not strong. About as session-y a beer as I can enjoy.
Tröegs Sunshine Pils;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tröegs Brewing Company;Sometimes I wish the purists would lay off the summer sessions. These are brewed with the notion that those who drink them are doing so after cutting the grass, going for a long run, or otherwise working up a sweat. At 4.5% this one is not going to ruin the next day. Pored into a Pilsener glass. Not much retention, very clear. Good aroma and nice finish. All in all a great beer for me to dink while sitting around the pool, after yard work, or any other sweaty endeavor. Cheers!
Tröegs Sunshine Pils;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tröegs Brewing Company;Not a bad lighter beer. Not as strong as I like but shouldn't expect much with a pilsner. Would probably buy for an all day beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;On tap at Gluek. Pours a clear light gold with a white head that dissipates quickly and completely. Aroma has earthy notes of biscuit and grain with a hint of straw. Flavor is similar with earthy bread and musty grain as well as a hint of straw.
Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;You know, it’s not a great beer, but I’m always surprised at how Gluek makes such cheap beer that’s actually drinkable.
Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;Wow, bad even for glueks. At this point, buy their red bock, or pony up the extra cash to get some Bud. Thouroghly undrinkable.
Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;Only slightly better than the other gluek offerings and this is only due to the fact that it doesn’t piss me off quite as much as the others when I drink it. The flavor is still awful yet minimal so again, people, read the ratings before you buy this. Don’t think that this is a good beer by any style.
Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;Fruity, pale, weak, wattery, all words that come to mind when drinking this. Only had it because of the price and homeland pride. Probably wont get it again.
Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;12oz can. Pours an extremely pale hay color with a fairly nice white head. Aroma is light and sweet, with a fruity lemon scent alongside a bit of grain and malt. Body is light and dry, with a very neutral flavor yielding just the slightest hints of citrus, grain, and malt and a slightly off aftertaste. Very...uh...cheap?
Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;A pale yellow appearance with a small white head. The aroma is very faint with some corn and lemons. The flavor is a bit on the dry side with some lemons, hay, and corn. Overall not too much going on here but not offensive either.
Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;I wish I could rate this beer lower. I was challenged by a brew friend to find the worst beer commercially available. I thought I had won with the Stite Light Lager which was worse than the Lawson Creek Vanilla Stout. Nope, she beat the pant off of me with this beer. Can you say oxidized buttered blood sausage. The three worst beers I have rated are from this brewery. I am no longer falling victim to their cunning marketing schemes.
Gluek Golden Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cold Spring Brewery;Canned. Pale straw body with a quickly fading bright white head. The aroma is grainy corn with some cherry syrup. There is also a little bit of buckwheat pancakes. The taste has glazed donuts with some apple chips. However, the finish is strangely metallic with some muted corn chips. Not as bad as some of Gluek’s other pale lagers.
Lovejoys Genius Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Minimal nose, I swear, they must intentionally make their beer smell like nothing at this place. I was hoping for something that would be like their Vanilla Stout, the only good beer in the house, but this stuff failed. Quite weak, thin, and watery, this stout should be ashamed of itself.
Scheldebrouwerij Bon Vivant Blond;Meer (Hoogstraten), Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Scheldebrouwerij;Citrus (lemon) but bit soapy aroma. Light amber color, white rocky head that diminishes fast, some lace. Not a bad brew but not interesting as well. Light sweet, some citrus, nicely hopped. Sparkling finish.

Inveralmond Pundie;Perth, Perth and Kinross, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inveralmond (Innis & Gunn);On cask at the Haymarket. Appearance - golden amber with a decent head. Slight haze.

Inveralmond Pundie;Perth, Perth and Kinross, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inveralmond (Innis & Gunn);Cask at the Falcon. Orange, light haze, still, small white head, full lacing. Aroma has varnish, grass. Body is medium, smooth, fairly high carbonation for cask. Taste is quite drying, malt-forward, sweet toffee-ish, some resin, floral hop character, soft bitterness.
Inveralmond Pundie;Perth, Perth and Kinross, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Inveralmond (Innis & Gunn);Gravity cask at the Bedford Beer Festival. A shade lighter than honey brown. Very clear. Aroma of malt, orange juice, cinnamon and clove. With such an exciting bouquet, I am somewhat disappointed by the taste: very middle-of-the-road malty bittersweet. However I’m more keen on the spicy honeyed citrus finish, and the beer as a whole does grow on me.

Elevator Coal Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Elevator Brewing Company;Not bad. True to style, tasty, nothing to offend. Commendable. On the critical side, there’s nothing particularly noteworthy about this beer either. It is dark, it has a faint tan head, it smells roasty, it tastes mildly roasty and of dark malt, and it finishes nice and dry in your mouth. There is a touch of coppery metallicness that seems just a touch off, but other than that, this beer was pretty good but not terribly out of the ordinary. Solid. I’d have it again, but I wouldn’t make a special trip for it. I had it on tap at Elevator.

Elevator Coal Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Elevator Brewing Company;Dark brown porter covered by a slice of beige head. Quite aromatic for a dark beer. This is roasty, yes, but mostly cerealic, hinting at a certain oatmeal character. Instead of taking the classic chocolate/coffee route, it heads towards licorice territory. In doing so, it manages to reach out towards a fair fruity background that haunts the finish with its tasty blackberry and dark grape hints. It remains mostly thin, but tasty enough for a brewpub porter.

Elevator Coal Porter;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Porter;Elevator Brewing Company;Hmmm, this is one where, if they could make it consistent, it would be very good. As it is, it is just too hit and miss. Looks like a Coke in the glass, smells of chocolate and earth. Slightly bitter, but most sips alternate between chocolate and roasted barley to bland and watery. Just all over the place, and never hits its stride. Too bad.

Nocal Cerveja Internacional;Luanda, Angola;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervejas de Angola (Heineken);0.33l can shared with The Tasting Crew. No doubt, a lovely looking pale golden looking one with a small quickly fizzing away white lager head. Doesn't smell fantastic by any means. Corn and dusty hay. Cereal and a metallic undertone. Not lovely to smell at. It has a good carbonation level and a thin oily texture in the mouth. Quite on the sweet side in the taste. Minerallic and dusty in the taste also. No doubt highly drinkable in the hot Angolan heat. Not a fantastic thing in the cold December Bergen winter. 11.12.2017
Nocal Cerveja Internacional;Luanda, Angola;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cervejas de Angola (Heineken);Standard light lager. Crisp and dry. Slight fruitiness that may be slightly out of style but not at all unpleasant. Refreshing.

Club Premium Lager (Ghana);Accra, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Accra Brewery (AB InBev);Many thanks for this sample to CH-303. It's my 132 new Country. Thanks Again Asbjorn for sharing this big bottle. Piwo ma prawie niewidoczna piane jest wielkosci pol centymetra, wyglada jak wino musujace, drobne babelki i jest bardzo jasne. Smakowo ten lager nieco, nieco lepszy od ostatnich egzotykow jakie testowalem, jest delikatne, moze lekko wodniste, ziarniste, ale malo slodkie, nie wyczulem tu tego taniego slodu kukurydzianego, a za to niewielka nutke goryczki, ktora szkoda ze nie potrafi zatrzymac sie na dluzej w przelyku.
ABC Golden Lager;Achimota, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;ABC Brewing Company (Heineken);I think the beer used to be good, but it is now almost impossible to find ABC, although there is still some old merchandising in many bars. Our bottle was fairly old too.
ABC Golden Lager;Achimota, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;ABC Brewing Company (Heineken);I had this beer while on a medical mission in Ghana a number of years ago, but I thought I’d rate it now (one more country to check off!). Obviously you are not going to find a brewing miracle in West Africa, but when its over 40 degrees Celcius with 90% humidity, if it even remotely tastes like beer and is cold, then it does the job just fine. This one is a poorly made pale lager that became a revered after-work treat, along with Star and the occasional Guiness. The atmosphere of Ghanaian hospitality, hot groundnut stew with fufu, and the contented feeling of having finished a hard days work are what elevate this rating to what it is.
ABC Golden Lager;Achimota, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;ABC Brewing Company (Heineken);In the can at the 2004 Crescent Moon Vintage Beer Tasting. A boring lager. Looks and tastes the same as just about any generic foreign lager.
Solibra Bock;Abidjan, Ivory Coast;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Solibra (Groupe Castel);Bottle coming from the Goutte d'Or area, Paris. Drinking and trying this bottle at Epalinges. Nothing outside of the common with this beer, a classical radler similar with the blizz of Feldschlosschen. The color is gold, clear, average carbonation, thin and whitr foam. The taste is sweet, lemonade that it is industrial, almost no hop, some malt, boring one but it is fully drinkable.

Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I have a half a dozen stubbies still in the cardboard pack if you are a collector ?
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle- a very nice beer. Good balance of malt and hops. a good version of an english pale ale.
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pale amber yellow white foamy head. Faint caramel when cold and a roasted malt toffee sweet aroma on glass swirl. Medium thin body with nice brit ale mouthfeel. Floral hoppy bitter flavoured start. Woody slightly malty sweeter middle and medium light bitter finish. The best boags beer brewed so far, clearly better than other australian beers
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Comfortably Boags’ best beer. A commemorative ale released in 2002 to mark the brewer’s 120th birthday. Brewed in the style of one of the brewer’s original ales from 1881. Pours a deep amber colour with a fair lacy head. Inviting rich, hoppy nose, with some spice to it. Medium-bodied. Big malty flavours at first but it goes AWOL in the middle before a mild bitter finish. Quite a warming, flavoursome style by current Aussie mainstream standards. (Bottle)
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled, with Sats, in Sydney. Amber with a lacy grey head. Distant hope and malt aromas. The flavour arrives from a slightly sweet base and fails to go on from there. Shy and withdrawn the 1881 design is a little too much like alcohol in a glass for the more flavour seeking palates. Soft, jammy end notes fail to impress.
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);rich dark amber colour, huge white head, sweet malty aroma. better cold as it warmed up became very soapy. I think had been on the shelf since 1881. thanks Neil.
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);better than the honey porter i suppose. nasty, dirty hops with faint honey in the odour. nutty, bready, syruppy malt and an ugly, alcoholic, rough, bitter and astringent finish. at least it's not flavourless, just bad.
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);You can tell its a boags beer. Typical ale, fruity flavours, malty goodness - overall quite a smooth little drop. cheers
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Wasn't overly impressed by this beer but could easily sit down and scoff three or four in a sitting without wincing too much. Not bad, not great
Boags 1881 Traditional Ale;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Ale - English;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);i was surprised by this beer. i had it at a nightclub, which is a strange place to sell this beer. i had to drink it out of the bottle, so i couldn't tell you what it looked like. it was malty slightly toffee like, and fruity and sweet. it has the same floral aroma and fruity taste that all of boags beers have.

Arran Ale (Cask);Isle of Arran, Strathclyde, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Arran;First tasted this at the Waterside Inn, Seamill in July 2000. Cask hanpump dispense. Crystal clear pale amber in colour with a thin creamy white head. Expecting a malty nose but got English floral hops instead. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malts give a tanin flavour with raisin fruit evident. Hop resins give a dry edge to the aftertaste. Finish is well balanced and bitteer sweet. Reminded me of Timothy Taylor Landlord? A good session ale.
Arran Ale (Cask);Isle of Arran, Strathclyde, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Arran;Cask@GBBF2011. Golden colour, small white head. Aroma is wood, some caramel malts, mild floral notes as well as some slight toasted notes. Flavour is much the same with some mild earthy and grassy notes as well.

Gulpener Korenwolf Lemon 2.5;Gulpen, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulpener Bierbrouwerij;Destijds gekocht voor het etiket, wel opgedronken, te hoog Spa Lemon gehalte, daar zitten ook tonen van citroen in en heb ook een hoog Co2 gehalte.
Gulpener Korenwolf Lemon 2.5;Gulpen, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulpener Bierbrouwerij;Nice lemons... tasted like Fanta Lemon. I think fruitbeer would almost be a better description. It''s a very weak beer in all directions possible.
Gulpener Korenwolf Lemon 2.5;Gulpen, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulpener Bierbrouwerij;I totally agree with jbrus. It's just fresh lemonjuice. The usual Gulpener Korenwolf is a nice refreshing wheat, but this lemon version is definitely not worth trying!
Gulpener Korenwolf Lemon 2.5;Gulpen, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulpener Bierbrouwerij;fresh sour lemon smell, typical witbier color. Refreshing, not too sweet. I like it.
Gulpener Korenwolf Lemon 2.5;Gulpen, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulpener Bierbrouwerij;Sharp lemon aroma, almost herbal. Yeasty. Swet, syrupy lemon taste, honeyish, bit herbal. Grape sugar and coreander. Bit watery, but refreshing. I like it! One of the most drinkable light beers on the market. The overall rate is lowered, because in my opinion it is more of a low alcohol soft drink than a beer.
Gulpener Korenwolf Lemon 2.5;Gulpen, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gulpener Bierbrouwerij;Strong lemon aroma. Looks like fresh lemonjuice, rocky white head that diminshes fast. Sweet, lemon flavor, very watery. Short sweet finish. Could be nice refreshing if you're not expecting a beer. But I was.
Diebels Dimix;Issum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Diebels (AB InBev);I do not understand why this beer exists. For sure it tastes much better than a Cola but an Alt beer is much better than this. I would have understood when they mixed their NA alt with Cola but this makes no sense to me
Diebels Dimix;Issum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Diebels (AB InBev);Sampled from 0.33 l bottle from local ’trinkgut’, best before January 2018. Clear, very dark red with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, off-white head. Sweetish, a little sourish, sugary aroma of cola and some caramel. Very sweet, minimally sourish, sugary taste of cola, some caramel and hints of cardboard, followed by a short, minimally bitter, a little tart finish. Thin to medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Okay although no beer at all, definitely drinkable, the super low ratings surprise me a bit.
Diebels Dimix;Issum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Diebels (AB InBev);0,33l Flasche. Dunkelbraunes Getränk, dunkler Schaum. Sehr süsser Coladuft. Seltsamer Geschmack. Cola und Malzbier. Nicht mein Fall!

Its head was small and white. Aroma had sweetness and cola. Palate was light bodied with medium carbonation. Flavours were sweetness, cola and sugar. Not a beer.
Diebels Dimix;Issum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Diebels (AB InBev);330ml bottle (Kaufland, Olpe) - fuck me! Sweet perfumey aroma. Yeah, this is just perfumey shitty cola. There’s some furniture polish in that, but furniture polish tastes better than this. Starchy paper hints - that must be the pretence of beer in the mix. Cinnamon too. Horror.
Diebels Dimix;Issum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Diebels (AB InBev);330ml bottle @laiti’s, thanks. Brown, Coca-cola color. Looks fizzy too. Sweet, cola in aroma and taste. As a soft drink it’s bad and as a beer it’s even worse. Baaaaaaaaaad! Never again!
Diebels Dimix;Issum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Diebels (AB InBev);33 cl bottle @ home, BBE 06/2015 Aroma is sweet with cola, some malty notes and some sweet licorice.

Diebels Dimix;Issum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Diebels (AB InBev);*Old rating, best before 18.12.04. Sehr leckeres Cola-Bier. Zwar schon sehr süß, aber die Cola harmoniert mit einer ganz leichten Altbier-Malzigkeit, die sich aber doch recht im Hintergrund hält. Der Nachgeschmack ist Cola-süß mit einem ganz leichten Altbier-Malz.
Diebels Dimix;Issum, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Brauerei Diebels (AB InBev);Dunkel rötlichbraun mit geringer Schaumkrone. Geruch sehr süß nach Cola. Geschmack süß klebrig nach Cola, von Bier ist nichts zu schmecken.

Limbricht Premium Pilsener;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;This beer has a light yellow body - hue apperance and a coarse white scum collar. I have drunk the beer from the bottle and it had a lot of carbonic acid. The initial flavor taste is bitter.
Limbricht Premium Pilsener;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Bottle, Hoppy and a bit soapy aroma. Flavour is a bit sweet fruity. I like the normal Alfa better.

Limbricht Premium Pilsener;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;Hoppy, bit soapy aroma. Just a bit hoppy flavor with an underlying orange fruitiness. Maybe a bit sticky. One of the better supermarket brands available.
Limbricht Premium Pilsener;Schinnen, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Alfa Bierbrouwerij;taste is not very explicite, but the taste after is pretty good it seems this could be the afterpartybeer!

Craigmill Swallow I.P.A.;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);This was very hazy when poured, head non existent.The nose is quite pleasant, light, fruity and fresh, a lightly flavoured beer, not much to it to be honest. 39p from a dump bin in my local Morrison, BBE date is Dec 2005, two bottles only, they also had some Coopers sparkling ale, also at 39p!!!
Craigmill Swallow I.P.A.;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Bottled. Golden amber beer with a smoothly caramel and hopped aroma. The flavour is quite grassy, slightly hopped and slightly fruity. Overall a good ale.
Craigmill Swallow I.P.A.;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);"Pours cloudy light cold with a very small white head. Strange aroma, quite funky / musty. Reminds me of rotting oranges. Taste is just as strange, very musty/funky, feel is very very thin. I think this may be off, either that or very ""unique""."
Craigmill Swallow I.P.A.;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Pale amber coloured. Sweet and weak aroma of hay. Very boring and watery. Not much hoppiness anywhere.
Craigmill Swallow I.P.A.;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Bottled. A nice orange gold coloured beer with no head and little carbonation. The aroma is really hoppy, citrus notes especially oranges shine out. The taste too has good hop qualities and is quite thick in the mouth. There is a little off-putting sulphorous note hidden in there, but for a 4% hoppy British beer it’s really good.

Craigmill Swallow I.P.A.;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Golden, small head, soft carbonation. Cellery nose with some parfume notes. Not unpleasant. Medium bitter hops taste, medium long lasting. A bit spicey at the end.
Craigmill Swallow I.P.A.;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);"Fruity, floral hop nose; hazy dark yellow; scumy head. Thin malt body - quick profile. Tangy broad hop bitter like rocket - lingers forever. Thin, scratchy texture. Kinda like a homebrew, but I like it."
Craigmill Porridge Stout;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Stout;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Tasted this at the Three Judges, Glasgow in February 2003. Cask, handpump dispense. Dull jet black in colour with ruby tints around the edges and a thin buff head. Dusty black malt in the short aroma. Thin but creamy mouthfeel and good lacing throughout. Dark malts give a burnt toast note at the start which then gives way to milky coffee, molasses and dry drinking chocolate powder in a smooth mouthfeel. Dry hoppy bitter prickle noted in the short aftertaste. Finish is dry with a slight liquorice note present. A decent session stout.

Craigmill Porridge Stout;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Stout;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);"Very dark with little to no head. Roasted malts dominate the nose with a yummy hint of coffee bean. Thin and light, this could be the first ""session stout""! Very smooth and enjoyable. At the tasting, I kept saying, ""I haven't tried that stout yet..."" Luckily someone handed me a full pint to shut me up for a while."

Craigmill Cock Sparra;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Red Ale - Irish;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Deep red/brown colour. Served too cold to get much of the aroma, A balance of malt and bitterness on the palate, but can't say I noticed the Oregon hops too much. A robust and rather rustic ale, but quite pleasant, if unexceptional. Cask (handpump), Lord Moon of the Mall (JDW), Whitehall, London SW1.
Craigmill Cock Sparra;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Red Ale - Irish;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Cask Conditioned, at the Head of Steam, London. Amber with a lacy white head.

Craigmill Cock Sparra;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Red Ale - Irish;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);JDW Maidstone. Good condition. Perfect temperature. Brown red colour. An initial malt sweetness is quickly balanced by dry almost tannic hops that lead into an earthy bitterness in the finish. Nice, but not my thing.
Craigmill Cock Sparra;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Red Ale - Irish;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Deep ruby red with floral aroma. Some spice flavor at the beginning, nice sweet malty middles. Dry finish.
Beaver Street Nut Brown Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Beaver Street Brewery;Normal pour, subpar head, ok lacing. The aroma was too strong on a coffee type slant, as was the flavor initially, strong bitter coffee in a brown ale with only bitter nuts detectable underneath. As it warmed, this thing improved, but it wasn’t smooth and was only average in the style.
Beaver Street Nut Brown Ale;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Brown Ale;Beaver Street Brewery;Some milky chocolate, yeastyness, sweet and toasty malt flavors, it's filtered to a clear brown with amber hues, medium effervescence and some creaminess and light resins.

Beaver Street R & R Oatmeal Stout;Flagstaff, Arizona, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Beaver Street Brewery;Poured up on tap at the brewpub where it exhibits a deep dark body that supports a thin dark tan head. The aroma offers up chocolate malt balls, dark roasted malts, chocolate malts and a thin layer of burnt malts. The taste delivers chocolate malts, some dark roasted maltiness and then thin malt sweetened shards of bunt malts. It picks up a bit of sweet black licorice to sort of a cola sensation from time to time. The chocolate and dark roastiness run from front to back. Pretty nice.

Watch City Hops Explosion IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Amber pour. Citrus hop aroma, citrus and spicy hop flavor, but not too bitter.
Watch City Hops Explosion IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;I got this at the brewpub in Waltham. Was told by my server it was fresh. Absolute palate crusher. In a good way. Almost tasted like spicy licorice. One of the more extreme hop experiences I’ve had in a while. Had to switch up to water after the first pint. 63 ibus seems a bit modest. Or it could have just been the choice of hops or that I was drinking it new. This was a tough pint to drink, but as a hop lover, it was tough love. I could barely taste the bleu cheese on my burger that came out after I finished the pint.
Watch City Hops Explosion IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;(beer tasting @ Monty’s Krown - Rochester, NY: bottle - 22 oz) Hazy amber color with a thick white head.

Watch City Hops Explosion IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Pours light golden in color with a thin white head. Restrained hop aroma, not much of an explosion. Little caramel sweetness added on the tongue. Palate was thin. Decent enough.

Watch City Hops Explosion IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;Enjoyed at the brewpub. This batch came out 5.9% a.b.v. and IBU 68. Medium yellow, that leaves a lace trail. C-hop aroma. A good bitterness, like a 1.5 times IPA.
Watch City Hops Explosion IPA;Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;IPA;Watch City Brewing Co.;A golden amber ale with a thin off white head. A restrained floral hops and caramel malt. In mouth, a more British IPA with dry malt, astringent notes, and grapefruit. Medium bodied. On tap at brewpub, Oct. 12 2008.
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;plale Bronze pour with a filmy white head. Aroma is wheat and light fruitiness. Flavor is sweet wheat grain, light berry fruit. Overall uninspired, but then again, I cant think of a blueberry ale that is.
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Pours amber into a tumbler. Head quickly recedes to sicken surface. Mild blueberry juice aromas. Slick with blueberry upfront and a sour finish.
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Slightly hazed gold pour with white head and lace. Aroma of blueberries, bread, and wheat. Lighter blueberry flavor, perfumy, with spiced hops. Medium bodied with light carbonation.

Aroma is blueberry, some light malt, hint of hops. Taste is blueberry, some light malt/grain, some lemon, spice/slightly metallic hops with a bite.
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Beautiful blueberry smell. The taste is closer to a pale ale with a good blend of hop and blueberry in the finish. Modest head that dies out but leaves pieces of lace.
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Bottled. Hazy golden, rich head. Blueberry pie aroma. Sweet and mkedium bodied with clean rounded mouthfeel. Like blueberry pie with vanilla custard. Low bitterness. I believe the brewmaster has succeeded in his ambitions, but I’m not sure I like where (s)he’s going.
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"(Bottle from Marcorelle’s) Pours hazy light coppery gold with a very slight pinkish tint. Thin off-white head. Aroma of berries but behind it it’s kind of sourish and dishraggy. Mouthfeel fairly smooth, light, fair bit of carbonation. Lots of light, patchy lacing. Flavor of berries mixed with that distinct soapiness I get with alot of the blueberry beers. Seems to have a bit of spice in the finish. A decent one - at least it seems ""real""."
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;A nice, clean, refreshing beer for berry season. Smells of blueberry muffins, though has a fairly weak blueberry flavor. Easy to drink, balanced.
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;I actually think this is a quite good beer. It’s not quite as well balanced as Sweetwater Blue and that’s its problem, but it is its rival. I could have sworn the ABV was higher...but I guess I was wrong. I really enjoyed this brew though. I had it from a bottle in Florida when I bought a six pack in Panama City.
Stone Cat Blueberry Ale;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Ipswich Ale Brewery;October 2007. Tap. A generally weak blueberry brew. Smells lightly of berries and wheat. Looks a pale yellow with a little white head. Overall is fairly watery with a light flavor of blueberries. A decent summer beer, I suppose, but nothing compared to Sweetwater Blue.
Deja Brew Watermelon Ale;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Deja Brew;Draught @ Holyoke Brewfest: All watermelon nose. Golden pale amber hue. Small white head. Pleasant and easy drinking. Sweet, all flavored watermelon. Obviously an extract...Definately drinkable, and fairly unique.
Deja Brew Watermelon Ale;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Deja Brew;Boston Beer Summit 2003: This had a strong watermellon aroma, and I rated it really high because it was PLEASING to smell, but in retrospect, it wasn't pleasing in a beer way. It was pleasing in a Jolly Rancher way. The flavor, however had a very bitter, hoppy attack. I think it was almost TOO bitter for what they seemed to be trying to accomplish with the beer. Is it supposed to be sweet, or is is supposed to be bitter. Unfortunately the bitter overpowered the watermellon flavors until the very end, and you didn't quite get to enjoy it long enough.
Deja Brew Watermelon Ale;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Deja Brew;Has a golden color and a nice watermellon smell. Taste is of watermellon, but it finishes pretty flat. Overall this was a pretty good fruit beer, but the watermellon flavor finished to quickly.
Deja Brew Watermelon Ale;Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Deja Brew;On tap Boston Beer Summit '02: Let me preface this by saying that I don't like fruit beers. This one I liked. Big watermelon aroma without smelling fake. Good malts back up the fruity taste. I do want to taste this again to make sure all the other beer I had that day isn't talking, but I think I found a unique solid fruity brew.
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;On tap. Golden red with small white head. Aroma grassy hops, some wood and bourbon.

Floral hops in the nose, some yeast. Light to medium sweet flavor, nice and bitter. Tons of floral bitterness, light grass, dough, light candi sugar. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Dries lightly in the finish, with notes, with lightly toasted sugar, grass, flowers. Seems just slightly watery, but overall very nice.
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;On tap at Sunset Grill. Served in a tulip. Pours a moderately-hazy light golden color with a good white head and a bit of lacing as it makes its way down the glass. Thin cap nearly throughout. The nose brings forward some light banana, a bit of yeast, and a light grainy presence. Nothing too complex, but everything fits together quite well. The flavor falls along the same lines. The banana was light and carried the rear, while the more forward flavors were a bit of other yeastiness as well as a pervasive presence of grain. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Pretty decent. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 03-22-2011
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;On draft at The Ale House in Amesbury , MA. Poured a light orange with a white head. Nose of malts and other odd aromas. Medium body and light mouthfeel. Flavor is spicy with lots of malt. Kind of an odd tasting beer, but drinkable.
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;From tap at Sunset Grill. Pours clear and golden orange with a small white head. Aroma is roasted malty and phenolic. Spiced and phenolic. Dry malty and slight yeasty. Dry phenolic finish.
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;In short: A inoffensively bland slightly citrusy golden ale. Meh How: Tap at Pour Farm, New Bedford, MA The look: Almost clear golden blonde body topped by a white ring of foam In long: The very light nose is a bit citrusy. In the mouth I got bready malts, some citrus fruits, some wet grass. A little tartness. No bitterness to speak of. Carbonation is very active. An inoffensive beer for the mass. I spent only one night in this beer wasteland, extremely boring and very ugly town called New Bedford, MA. And by the end of the night I wished I was running a business making ashtrays made out of human skulls.
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;Pint on draft - Pale red to golden, sweet, fruity, lighter flavor. Perhaps trying to emulate a Belgian style. Good session beer
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;Big City Allston tulip ($5.25): The bartender poured it without a head, so I can’t comment on that aspect. The beer is a translucent red color. Sweet malty and cherryish aroma. Some Belgian notes are there, but not in full force. Tastes kind of sweet. The high alcohol is covered by the sugar I would assume. Mild hop presence and some bitterness throughout. Pretty fruity tasting. Good, but as others have said, far from great.
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;Sampled at Sunset Grill Allston. Pours a hazy yellow with some frothy white head. Fruity aroma, lightly sweet, light citrus. Flavor is malty, citrus, bread, a little sugar. Finish is medium bodied. Nothing wrong, per se, but completely forgettable.
Rapscallion Premier;Fiskdale, Massachusetts, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rapscallion;Was nice to have this on tap in Boston even though it is made in Western MA where I am from. This light orange beer had a slight head in my pint glass. The aroma was sweet but also a bit estery and like peptic. Fruity and smooth taste witha bit of hop bitter, Nice middle of the road beer
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);OLD NOTES NOV 3, 2004 Skuny kinda yeast aroma, with a bit of hop and wierd mustiness to it. Pours golden with foamy little head. The flavour itself is inoffensive and nothing complex. Bit of hops or something going on there. The carbonation feels a bit odd on the tough, and has an odd bit end to it. If you’re going to go cheap Boags, avoid this, the Draught shits all over it!
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle- I’m just updating my records- Another boring pale lager in their range.
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Plain old gold beer with an average white head that stuck to my glass quite well. Got a good whiff of tasty fresh citrusy hops and the smallest hint of malt. The hops dominate what exists for flavour. Those same hops crinkled my tongue and left a nice bitter finish. Drank in under 5 minuites - sucker went down with amazing ease.
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Another thin-bodied lager in Boags’ drab line-up. It poured the colour of Sunday morning piss, with slightly more head. Lots of citric hops and little else in the aroma. A skinny quenching palate and the faintest of dry finishes. So bland I’m struggling to keep my eyes open. (Bottle)
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Meh. It’s a lager. There is nothing overtly good or bad about it. I keep forgetting I don’t like it so much and end up buying one or two every 6 months or so.
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bright clear gold colour with a medium-size fully lasting head. Hoppy aroma with a smooth flavour that is nothing too exciting but easily quaffable.
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);An all round inoffensive blandish beer. Doesn’t suffer form the chemical nastiness of most standard Aust lagers. Probbaly a good reguler quaffer.
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Always a worry when you see something on special that hasn’t actually been in the shops for a long time here. Probably the rep said this was a good deal and thought it was worth an unload here. The description says it is a pale lager. It is. Beertalk synonyms for pale in my mind are bland, fleeting. lifeless and unexceptional. Put this in a blind tasting and it would truly be confused with a number of average Aussie lagers
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Nice gold colour with good head retention and lacing. Very clean aroma, pretty much nothing going on, which is an advantage over most of its contemporaries. Flavour of crystal malt, pretty light on otherwise and not as bitter as I recall. Quite drinkable and without any real flaws but doesn’t really have anything all that great about it either really.
Boags Original Bitter;Launceston, Tasmania, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;James Boag (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Well i am going to stick up for this beer. I really really like it. This beer is aggressive and has a nice level of bitterness with a bit of an aley character. Much more complex than strongarm and blows classic right out of its own water. Easily Boags best.
Nynäshamns HK IPA;Nynäshamn, Sweden;IPA;Nynäshamns Ångbryggeri;Deep amber with creamy head. Big, flowery hop aroma. Ful bodied, but dominated by the grassy/flowery Fuggles hops all the way through. Very bitter finish. The 3rd IPA from this brewery. Perhaps overly flowery, but still a really nice pint for a hop head.
Hitachino Nest Amber Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Aromas of barley malt, herbal and grassy hops. Flavours are pine, grass and herbal hops, hints of citrus, balanced with some barley

Hitachino Nest Amber Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Cereal, malt, barley on the nose. Very pleasurable aromas. Snappy, hoppy bite on the tongue at first sip. Not much depth or mouthfeel. Decent enough though. Smell makes up for the other shortcomings.
Hitachino Nest Amber Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Bottle from LCBO. Pours an average size frothy beige head and has an amber appearance. Bubbly sticky lacing. Slightly excessive carbonation. Aromas of barley malt, herbal and grassy hops.

Aroma of bread, singed toffee, grapefruit, pine. Creamy. Almost burnt toffee.The malt is not overwhelmed by resin but it's getting towards that. Brief finish with modest bitterness. Pretty good, not quite my sort of thing.
Hitachino Nest Amber Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);330ml bottle. Pours dark, clear amber with a small beige head. Aroma is caramel, pine, spices, nuts. Taste is light sweet, caramel, resin, dried fruit. Mild bitter finish. Excellent.

Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);33 cl bottle (BBD 2019-10), bought from Trevs Bar (DH1 3LN) and drunk at home 2019-08-31. Appearance is a hazy deep gold, with a thick, densely formed beige head that lingers for a fair time. Slightly unusual but quite pleasant. Aroma has tropical notes, with some pine and citrus (orange) as well. It's not wildly strong, but noticeable and nice enough. Taste is pretty good. Sweeter than the aroma suggests, with some orchard fruit notes and perhaps some grassy hints. Not too much bitterness from the hops, but a little bit of drying bitterness comes through towards the finish. Palate is definitely the weakest aspect. Medium-bodied and juicy with a little in mouth carbonation, but there's basically no finish which is disappointing. Overall, this is pretty nice. Nothing revolutionary, but it's nicely fruity. I do want more finish, but it's not a deal breaker and certainly wouldn't stop me having another.
Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);330ml bottle given to me by Stephen - cheers mate! Sampled on the 7th August 2019. Opaque straw in colour with a thin white head that quickly disappears. Light floral hoppy aroma with notes of lychees and warm bread. Thin resiny mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malt base gives a light biscuit base with soft citrus fruit notes of lychees and gooseberry coming through. Aftertaste is hoppy with lychee fruit becoming more dominant on the palate over the fading gooseberry flavour. Finish is again hoppy with juicy lychees to the fore, building light astringency in the mouth.
Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);As of this moment, this is the hoppiest Japanese beer I've tasted (quite possibly the first). Mild bitterness and hops with a light dry finish.
Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);I have found this bottle, at Biervana, in Munich, trying and enjoying this bottle, at home, in Epalinges. The color is copper and aorange bit orange, clear, regular carbonation, thin and white foam. This one is almost an IPA, good and smooth, side of resine, pine tree, strawberry, a pleasant bitterness and hop.

Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Online order @ LCBO, nice pale ale, nothing to envy to competition as a basic reference, well done from Japan.
Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Аромат хмелевой, весьма горький, легкие еловые нотки. Цвет немного темнее чем должен быть. Пена хорошая, большая, хотя и мыльная немного. Вкус питкий, сильно карбонизирован. Вкус по началу нравится, но вот послевкусие не очень. А точнее это лично мои пристрастия к именно этому хмелю и его еловые и лесные нотки мне не нравятся. Ну а так среднее пиво.
Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);0.33 l bottle from K-Citymarket Ruoholahti, Helsinki. English School of Pale Ale, well, maybe a bit on the bitter side. No American Citrus, but pine trees.
Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);Half pint of the cask condition version at the Hitachino Brewing Lab at Tokyo Station in Japan. Appearance is a clear coppery amber with no froth as it is not carbonated, which also meant that the aromas were muted, but there is no repressing the caramel notes in the brew. Taste is unusual, this seems to be a traditional English pale ale with few hops, so it is caramel, malty, some bitter piney notes, in a smooth medium bodied brew.
Hitachino Nest Pale Ale;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);A light coppery colour, a head is medium and blond. Aroma has caramel malts, some citrus, also wood. Taste has caramel, wood, citrus, quite mild bitterness. More caramel in the end. Medium bodied. Quite lots of caramel.
Hitachino Nest Stout;Konosu, Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Stout;Kiuchi Brewery (Hitachino);"A glassfull of used motor oil toped with a small light brown head. Roasted malts take center stage but this isn’t a ""one trick pony"" as other Japanese stouts that I’ve tried have been. There is sweetness from the malts and yet a bit of a tart follow. A tangy bitter aftertaste. A dangerously easy to drink beer. My only knock on it is that it’s a bit thin bodied for a stout."

Prévôtoise Bière du Schnappou 2002;Moutier, Switzerland;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Prévôtoise;cloudy amber colour with a big foam, vinegar aroma with some malts, quite sour and acidic, medium-bodied, malty sour finish - something's wrong here
Prévôtoise Bière du Schnappou 2002;Moutier, Switzerland;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Prévôtoise;"Amber-orange ale, nice head, misty. Nice hop aroma, not floreal; subtile mix of light aromas: a bit fruity, spices (black pepper), very light sourness, grapefruit. Bitter dry, as first impression, tart, light sourness; the style is close to some dry Belgian Oud Bruin, interesting, but poor malt and hop. Same notes for the palate, bitter-dry, a bit astringent.

Farida Lager Beer;Baghdad, Iraq;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Eastern Brewery Co.;I did not expect beer from Iraq at all, but the english labeled can gives a hint that the main customers might not be local people. It looks quite pale with only a hint of foam. The taste? ... well although beer from Baghdad is exotic it doesn’t taste exotic but simply bad. like water with something like hops, bitter, no body, sweet at some times. No wonder the prophet did not allow the drinking of beer ...
Farida Lager Beer;Baghdad, Iraq;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Eastern Brewery Co.;Resin and a bit citrusy hop aroma. Clear yellowhead disappears instantly. Medium sourness, light sweetness, umami taste. Fizzy, lively. Nice drinkable beer, nothing very special but a good beer.
Farida Lager Beer;Baghdad, Iraq;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Eastern Brewery Co.;Foam dissapears right away. Lot of bubbles by look of it. Lightly golder color. Light hop smell. Sour, suprisingly not watery. Lightly sweet aftertaste.

Farida Lager Beer;Baghdad, Iraq;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Eastern Brewery Co.;50 cl can courtesy of Bierkrug. Cereal grains very evident, pours with thick silky head, slightly sour palate and taste, decent lacing, but not much else remarkable in the palate. Props to entrepreneurs in Iraq for providing some homebrew in probably less than ideal conditions.
Farida Lager Beer;Baghdad, Iraq;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Eastern Brewery Co.;Milder, abgestanden wirkender Getreidebeginn mitzunehmender Herbe, die aber wässrig bleibt. Hellmalzig, laffe Süße. Plörrig bitter-wässriger Abgang. 8/4/5/4/9/4
Farida Lager Beer;Baghdad, Iraq;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Eastern Brewery Co.;Courtesy of Bierkrug, thanx a lot, Michael!!! Shared with Cunningham!!! In the glass the beer is pale yellow, slightly cloudy and does not have a foam. It smells malty sweet, much grains and some corn. Starts spoiled fruity, pale malty and watery. The middle part is much more watery and lax, it tastes like flavored water. Goes into a sweet-grainy, very lax finish!
Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Draft at the Source. Somewhat murky deep yellow light golden color with a smallish quickly dissipating white head. Spicy yeast cereal grainy aroma and flavor with just a hint of lemon. Not my favorite style, but I could pound this if I had to.
Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;A very traditional interpretation of the style. Sharp wheat bite. Exactly what it should be.
Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;On tap at the source in the company of jcwattsrugger. Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma is wheat, clove, coriander and orange peel. Flavor is the same with the addition of some light banana. Light in the mouth and quite easy drinking. Nice.
Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Cloudy. Bananas and fruit juice. Taste is also banana heavy. Yeasty and fruity. Wheat heavy probably my favorite of the bunch.
Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Draft. Nose is spot on for style, wheat, coriander and oranges. Flavor is a traditional Belgian Wit. Orange peel, coriander with a decent wheat yeast body. Coriander seed is light, thankfully. Medium body with a sweet citrus finish.
Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;In short: A typical brewpub witbier (wheat, bananas, coriander, etc.). Inoffensively easy to drink How: Tap at brewpub The look: Almost clear dark blonde body topped by a small white head In long: The relatively strong note (for the style) has bananas, orange peels and coriander. Taste is more of the same. Wheat, bananas, orange peels and coriander. Finish is a little dry. Body was a little slim (even for the style) and the carbonation could have been more lively. As expected, nothing special. I don’t know if I’m more a beer geek or a computer geek. After carefully examining the beer menu at Marthas I wanted to drink everything and wondered what font they used.

Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Part of an 8 beer sampler at the restaurant. Enjoyed the restaurant and all the beers I tasted were good though nothing really stood out. Their white beer was actually pretty good for what it is though I’m not really that into the style.
Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;on tap-pours a thin white head and yellow color. Aroma is clove, perfumy. Taste is clove, light malt/grain, perfumy/slightly spice (saaz like) hops.
Marthas Belgian White;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Doing this from memory. Very nice beer. nice aroma and flavor, citrus/orange. Very refreshing, great wheat beer. Definitely would have it again
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;hazy pale golden, Aroma is mild cracker malt with some light bitter hops. Mouthfeel is light, crisp. flavor is a bit bland, metallic. Meh, its crisp.
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Straw gold pour with creamy white head and lace. Very light malt and medium papery aroma. Medium semi sweet malt with a decent light/medium bitter. Not bad but not special.
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;12oz bottle-pours a dissipating white head and hazy yellow/gold color. Aroma is light malt, hint of hops. Taste is light malt-some sweet, some hops bite. Easy.
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;"Big, fluffy head; recedes with a center dome. Cloudy, but solid gold color. Nice soft floral hop aroma. Attractive in a mild way. Slightly sour which is distracting. Otherwise, this is a pleasant, if soft, beer with a light malt flavor. Good hop balance. A touch of fruitiness. Rich body for the style."
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Another beer with a different look, a different name, and yet tastes the same as the rest of the bad pee hops used in the other beers. All metallic.
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;December 2008 Beer of the Month Club Overall Impression: This was a nice smooth Blonde Ale, not too unique, but it drinks well
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Beer of the month club, Jan. Just all kinds of things going on with this beer, and not in a good way. Plenty of bizarre flavors, metallic, etc. This beer, and pretty much the whole style, is skippable.
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;Opaque straw with light white head. Sweet straw and citrussy orange and grapefruit aroma. LIght, crisp citrussy bite at the tip of the tongue. Very lightly roasted malt with a little sweetness and a light hop bite. The taste lasts with a bit of the sweetnes and a hop bitterness along the middle of the tongue. A nice session beer. The tasts is nothing special, but the flavor is nice enough to have a few and not get bored with it.
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;A cloudy, dark gold pourwith a large, tight bubbled, pure white head. The flavor was much lighter than the dark color would imply. The hops also had a light touch. It goes down quickly, a good session beer. The head held up well. Not much of an aftertaste.
Stone Cat Blonde;Ipswich, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ipswich Ale Brewery;This has got a nice aroma, something I should be able to place but can’t right now. Quite dark for a golden, almost orange. Fruity coriander maybe? I was quite impressed with this. The flavor is sharp, maybe a bit too fruity to be a true session beer, but mostly a solid beer. Quite surprised that I liked it so much and that others didn’t.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;Bomber - Poured a dark amber in color with a small white head and low carbonation. Some nice lacing apparent. Aroma is is not strong, but has a citrusy hop character. Flavor is not strong either, but a nice citrus hop flavor along with medium bitterness make it quite pleasant. Some residual sweetness in the finish provides some balance. Finish is clean with a lingering bitterness. An ok bitter brew, but not outstanding.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;Light and melony aroma with citrus tones waft from this amber brew. Lacing is ample from a small off-white head. Carbonation is minimal with tight bubbles. befitting a bitter. Nicely balanced with a lingering slightly sharp bitter finish. Well crafted, but not very exciting.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;The Lure: Peaches, grapefruit and cantaloup fruitiness roam atop floral hoppiness. Sweetness appears butterscotch-like at times, and for now dominates the hops, surprising for a McNeill’s brew. The Festivities: The low but adequate carbonation seems to attempt an emulation of cask bitters. Wooden hop dryness gets a little chalky at times. Grapefruit juice and cantaloup slices sit strong, as flowers grow sparsely around. Fruit get relatively sweet as caramel emboldens them, all the while remaining very drinkable due to airy spaces between flavors. Transcendence: Getting your clothes dirty, but at a picnic.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;Hazy orange body with thin offwhite head. Sweet orange citrus aroma. Hollow flavor that gives a sweet tangy palate and active carbonation. Crisp clean finish.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;Poured a medium golden color with an averaged sized off white head. Some floaters. Aromas of light fruits, some citrus and light toffee. Tastes of citrus, caramel and some grass in the finish. Lively body. Starts out lightly sweetand ends on a light hoppy bitter finish.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;Thanks to HopDog for this. Pours a cloudy peach with floaties and a small white head that laced the glass. Aroma is bitter with lighter fruits and some spicness. Fizzy feel a little lighter in taste than aroma. Not very bitter taste. Slight caramel and pine in the finish.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;Poured a hazy golden color with a thin, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus hops, yeast, light banana, and caramel malt. Taste of grassy hops, some citrus, toffee malt, light pine, some yeast, and a bitter hoppy finish.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;Cask conditioned. Clear amber pour with a thin bubbly white head. Appealing aroma of floral and citrusy hops. Flavor of floral and citrusy hops with caramel. Medium body, smooth, confortable texture, soft carbonation.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;No real aroma. Smooth mouthfeel like velvet and very nice going down. Well balanced and very nice-a.
McNeill's Summer Bitter;Brattleboro, Vermont, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;McNeill's Brewery;Light brown sugary color. Sweet fruity smell. Smooth. Easy and yummy to drink. Very good!
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;This beer definitely has it’s own flavor. Every once in a while I really get a craving for it, but alas, it is no longer available. THIS IS NOT A SUMMIT BREW. If you have had Summit’s Finnegan’s you are NOT drinking the same beer. James Page Brewing went out of business a few years back and their recipes were purchased by Steven’s Point Brewing co. Point actually sells a few of the recipes under the name James Page, just not this one.
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;The head was small and diminishing. There was not much aroma, but I liked the flavor. I will order this beer again!
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;light in tatste at first but taste lingers, must be the patatoes. hi-ho i’m from idaho, or am i?
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;"Page used to have a Potato Ale under their own labeling,(you have to read the fine print at the bottom to learn that it is ""brewed, bottled, and supported by the James Page Brewing Co in NE Minneapolis, MN) and I have to wonder if this isn't exactly the same. Actually, I wonder why you would want to make an ale with potatoes! In the mid'90's, the Augsburger Brewery had a billboard campaign featuring art by cartoonist Charles Burns. One featured a brewer in a field holding a spud, with the slogan ""NEVER made with potatoes!"" But these folks are right up front with it! ""A charmingly smooth pale amber ale brewed with potatoes."" Amber color is right, with a small, plain head, and no aroma to speak of. After that, it's alarmingly lame. Short finish, light body, no hops, little malt...I wasn't terribly pleased. Is it smooth? Yes, to a fault. Charming? Eh, I don't know... I still don't get the potatoes. Yesterday, I visisted a reputable local brewpub and tried their Potato Stout. They just don't belong in beer! What's next, radishes? Rutabaga? Rhubarb?"
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;Brewed and bottled by Summit Brewing. Virtually no aroma at all, maybe a faint wet graininess if I try really hard. Some decent caramel malt flavor, some hop bitterness, clean and vaguely pleasant, but I'd like at least a little aroma.
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;"Hmm...The ""finnegans"" i purchased was brewed by Summit, not James Page, but perhaps there are transactions i am not aware of. This beer is quite tasty. It's light, creamy, malty and easily surpasses other ""Irish"" beers on the market. This beer is rather thin but quite well-balanced and drinkable. A solid 6 pack buy."
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;Sparkling clear, deep golden ale with a small, fizzy, white head. The aroma is a touch bisquity with notes of chicken broth. Lightly floral. The flavor is well-balanced but fairly bland and thin. Light-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish. Brewed with potatoes? Novel, I guess... the whole Irish theme.
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;The first whif straight off the bottle reminds me of pot roast with those baby potatoes and gravy.Copper color,small head with the above for an aroma,with a malty side to it.The flavor is malty with a slight sweet taste and mild hops at best with maybe a hint of spuds.The after taste is sweet malt with a mild hop presence and maybe a starchy potatoe(maybe) this is a pretty decent brew and from the desc.goes for a good cause.Leave it to James Page to help the less fortunate when they themselves are a struggling craft brewer.
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;"I'm not exactly sure this is the same Finnegans Irish Amber since the bottle says it is brewed by Summit, which of course is a local competitor to James Page. Just for the record the label on the bottle is brown and green and states it is brewed with potatoes. Also states ""As Irish as it Gets!"" However here is my humble opinion. Not much aroma at all. Very little almost non existant head. Poured amber color a bit darker than the picture with nowhere near that head. Flavor was very smooth and pleasant but not significant. Carbonation was not great but at least not entirely flat tasting. This at least warrants a try for a hot summer day. I'd drink it again but won't go out of my way to get any more."
James Page Finnegans Irish Ale;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale - Irish;James Page Brewing Company;Faint Aroma, nice amber color, but poor head retention. The head is even already dissapating in the photo on this page! However, this is a very pleasant brew, with a dry, subtle hoppy aftertaste with notes of creaminess. I could drink this all night.

Zythum Steam Beer;Milano, Italy;California Common / Steam Beer;Zythum;Bottle. No defects but no outstanding features, balanced but a bit too watery.
Zythum Steam Beer;Milano, Italy;California Common / Steam Beer;Zythum;A very suprising beer full of a very unique taste. It’s almost a bit syrupy -- but at the same time very dry. Entirely different from the Anchor and quite refreshing. A nice change from the malt-heavy crap that most italian breweries spew out when they’e not making poor lager.
Zythum Steam Beer;Milano, Italy;California Common / Steam Beer;Zythum;No aroma. Nice taste, most of all hoppy, some malt in the middle. Pleasant hoppy palate.
Zythum Weiss Beer;Milano, Italy;Wheat Ale;Zythum;Light aroma and flavour of wheat beer. Simple, watery palate................
Zythum Cream Ale;Milano, Italy;Cream Ale;Zythum;2009 rating. Keg at the brewpub. It pours a clear golden color with medium white head. Aroma with erbal notes. Taste is mostly bitter with some spicy notes. Dry finish. Quite thin bodied.

Birrificio Casa del Popolo Chiara;Anzola dOssola (VB), Italy;Pale Ale - American / APA;Birrificio Casa del Popolo;"Gold ale, misty; thick head. Light, but nice hop aroma. Dry, good hop, not too much malt, weak body. Nice palate, bitter and aromatic, enough long"
Birrificio Casa del Popolo Ambrata;Anzola dOssola (VB), Italy;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Birrificio Casa del Popolo;"Amber ale, thick head. Light malt and hop aroma. Warm in the mouth, yet the body is weaken by some carbonation; good balance, strong hop, caramalt. Nice palate, strong bitterness. Very similar to a bitter ale."
Birrificio Casa del Popolo Rossa;Anzola dOssola (VB), Italy;IPA;Birrificio Casa del Popolo;Red ale. Very light roasted malt aroma. Pretty strong roasted malt taste, good hop balance, nice hop palate, strong bitterness.
Zythum Strong Ale;Milano, Italy;Strong Ale - English;Zythum;2009 rating. Keg at the brewpub. Amber colour, not much head. Madeira-nose with lots of wood in it. Also slight alcohol noteable. Flavour is very much madeira along with malts, raising and a nice sting of alcohol. Also some fruityness.
Zythum Strong Ale;Milano, Italy;Strong Ale - English;Zythum;"Ehh, strong, yes, unique, no. It’s much like most ""doppio malto"" here, but I appreciated that lack of disturbing sweetness that I usually associate with beers of this type here. English strong ale? Ok."
Zythum Strong Ale;Milano, Italy;Strong Ale - English;Zythum;Simple aroma, malt, candy sugar. Nice body, smooth, rather sweet, lightly malty, not enough balanced by the hop. Rather poor palate.
Texels Dubbel VOC;Oudeschild, Netherlands;Dubbel;Texelse Bierbrouwerij;Tasted a vintage bottle 30cl from 2003. full brown beer with a malty nose and taste. Due to age, some notes of chocolate, sherry and alcohol. Too bad, i should have drunk it fresh in 2003.
Texels Dubbel VOC;Oudeschild, Netherlands;Dubbel;Texelse Bierbrouwerij;Brown coloured. Nutty and malty with notes of chocolate. Smooth and mild mouthfeel.
Texels Dubbel VOC;Oudeschild, Netherlands;Dubbel;Texelse Bierbrouwerij;Caramelly, yeasty,flavours dominate. Quite dry and mild, with some mild tartness, quite Belgian in character, enjoyable (Bottle-GBBF 03')
Texels Dubbel VOC;Oudeschild, Netherlands;Dubbel;Texelse Bierbrouwerij;Bottled. GBBF2003. Muddy red brown, good thin white head and moderate condition. Low malty aromas, with hints of figs and roast barley. Slightly apple tangy in the mouth but with plenty of dark malt to counter it. Dry and roasty finish with some faint hoppiness lingering. Not a bad dubbel.
Texels Dubbel VOC;Oudeschild, Netherlands;Dubbel;Texelse Bierbrouwerij;Dark brown color, with firm thick lacing, very nice. Aroma of roasted malts and caramel malts. Sweet taste, again a bit 'stouty' of the roasted malts, coffee, salami. Bitter palate. Decent dubbel, but somewhat too roasted for me.
Texels Dubbel VOC;Oudeschild, Netherlands;Dubbel;Texelse Bierbrouwerij;"Mmm i see i'm the first one to rate this beverage, so i guess i have to say more than just ""good dubbel"" ;-). Very dark brown appearance, initially large head, beautiful lacing, similar to La Trappe's dubbel. Aroma of roasted malts, raisins and liquorice perhaps? Nose is pretty nice but not very strong (perhaps gets better when warming up). Malty flavour, obvious sweetness, a bit of coffee and a hint of chocolate. Quite nice, but it could use some additional elements, perhaps aging could help. Palate is initially bitter, but then goes on to be more sweet and a bit coffee-ish. Overall quite nice. Likely to be one of the best beers of this brewer."
Cēsu Gaišais Alus;Cesis, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cēsu Alus Daritava (Olvi);Draught. Clear pale gold with white head. A little limestone and corn in the nose, mild bitterness and a little dry in the mouth, very carbonated and light body underneath. A little corny aftertaste but not bad.
Cēsu Gaišais Alus;Cesis, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cēsu Alus Daritava (Olvi);Dark golden color, no head. Strongly buttery aroma, sweetness too. Thin to medium bodied. Sweet start in flavor ends with tangy and biting hops, butter tones too. Lasting bitterness and butter in aftertaste.
Cēsu Gaišais Alus;Cesis, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cēsu Alus Daritava (Olvi);Pale golden. Neutral aroma. Light bodied, very sweet, clean. Boring.........
Cēsu Extra;Cesis, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cēsu Alus Daritava (Olvi);28th May 2006. Warning! Early amateur rating! Bottle in Riga. Refreshing lager. Slightly fruity. Bitterish but with a clean finish. Respectable.
Cēsu Extra;Cesis, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cēsu Alus Daritava (Olvi);"the curiously shaped bottle no doubt figured into my friends mind in picking an exotic latvian beer to bring home to me. it’s cool: kind of shaped like a baseball bat, tho my guess it that it’s been labeled as exhibit ""A"" in more than a few trials of assault and battery in riga bar fights. the beer is frightfully pale-- brewed with albino malt presumably-- but the head was adequate and virginal white, a cotton crown suitable for a family-sized aspirin bottle. the hops arrived aromatically intact, all the way from northern europe to just under my nose-- where they resembled saaz and were reasonably pleasing. alas, they were also handicapped by the smell of open manhole, and grapes of the disreputable sort that go into wines like boone’s farm. for all of those flaws, cesu is still quenching and drinkable, albeit thin as a vegetarian lion. there were notes of grain, sweet pound cake, and a bounce dryer sheet. noted was a tinkle of fading bitterness in the finish. the beer may have been designed once upon a time to be a serious pilsner; if so, the process has gotten just a little slack presently. perhaps the poor, jaded brewer lost faith in all mankind and just said ""fuck it"" and decided to design the bottle to look like a billy club. and then he threw his work-boots into the wort."
Cēsu Extra;Cesis, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cēsu Alus Daritava (Olvi);Nifty 300 ml octagonal A leCoq brown glass bottle, bought in Riga. ABV is 5.0%. Pale golden colour, large to moderate white head. Fruity and flowery aroma, quite nice. The flavour is also fruity and quite refreshing. Lemony finish. Some more malts and bittering hops might have been a good idea. Light bodied, soft mouthfeel. No masterpiece, but better than I feared.
Cēsu Extra;Cesis, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cēsu Alus Daritava (Olvi);Yellow colored, lively carbonation with medium sized white head. Surprisingly clean aroma with lemon and esters, some fruits also, still no very much in there. Thin to medium bodied. Flavor is more unclean with mild cardboard, maybe some grainy tones also.

No real taste, a bit of malt somewhere if I hunt for it. Not actually nasty in any way, but basically fall-over juice. Rerate: 500ml plastic bottle - Thanks Marduk! (4:2:4:2:9=2.1) ""Better"" this time. Grainier ESL aroma. More mainstream macro ESL taste, quite papery. Tastes like a 9%-er watered down to 7%. Bitter finish. Still fall-over juice.

Thirsty Dog Airship Light;Akron, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of fine to medium sized mostly diminishing white colored bubbles that left behind no lacing. The body contained average carbonation, was transparent and straw yellow in color. Its aroma contained notes of mild malt to no aroma. Its mouth feel is initially smooth flat with a lingering palate and a smooth aftertaste. Its flavor contained mild malt hop notes.
Thirsty Dog Airship Light;Akron, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Dayton Draft. Clear amber color with small white head. Aroma was little to none. Flavor was smooth and refreshing with small sweet finish. Sorry, this is another moist air light.
Thirsty Dog Airship Light;Akron, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;(Dayton) Faint yellow pear cider body, white head. No discenible aroma. Taste is mild, medium sweet, some biscuit, no bitterness. Light body. Quite a waste of a tap.
Thirsty Dog Airship Light;Akron, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Rated at TDBC. Small white head that mostly diminished, fine-small sized bubbles, good lacing, carbonated, transparent, and a yellow hue. Aroma was malty and sweet. Flavor was sweet, malty and smooth. Smooth mouthfeel and light body.
Thirsty Dog Airship Light;Akron, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Obviously, this is Thirsty Dog's beer for the fizzie masses. Thin and yello. Malts are sweet, but not overly so. Try a sample and move on to some of their better beers.
Thirsty Dog Airship Light;Akron, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Slightly foul nose, yellow pissy color, low tight head. Fresh from tap, but this just isn't a good beer. Sweet canned corn-like maltiness. Thin and watery.

Thirsty Dog Airship Light;Akron, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;eeeh. Pretty much a typical light beer - but not quite as terrible..........
Thirsty Dog Airship Light;Akron, Ohio, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Not bad for a light beer, but it's a light beer so there are much better choices at a brewpub like this.
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Dayton draft. Good combo of a friut beer and porter styles. Complex aroma and flavor of raspberry and chocolate malt that had balanced medium finish. Good brew that you can use to smoke a cigar.
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Brown hue with ruby highlights, fading head and minimal lace. The nose was full raspberry juice with just a hint of roasted malts, nothing else. The taste is fruity and tart with the nutty buttery note. Some smoke upon the finish. Thin and lively feel. Arggh! Too fruity and not enough porter character.
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;So we are having dinner at the Dayton Brewpub and he orders the Nut Brown Ale. The waitress brings him this beer that smells and tastes distinctly of raspberrys. He complains, because he doesn't like many fruit beers, and she brings him another one. Same thing. Turns out neither the waitress not the bartender are allowed to taste anything, so they have no idea that they have the wrong keg tapped. Based on the color and flavor, we ended up drinking what we assumed to be the raspberry porter. Well, he drank most of it, I do not like fruit beers. I wanted the nut brown ale.

Based on the color and flavor, I ended up drinking what I assume to be the raspberry porter. It was a deep mahogany color with a slightly medicinal raspberry nose. Not overpowering syrup taste for a fruit beer (like that awful Pete's Winter) but a nice infusion of raspberry tartness over a solid porter. I still don't prefer fruit beers.
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Nose of what? raspberry? you guessed it. The raspberry and choclate blend well together, not overbearing. Clean at he finish. Bow wow!
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This mixed breed of Poodle (raspberry ale) and Boxer (old leghumper porter) produces one of those dogs that's so ugly that it's cute. This is like a Chocolate/Raspberry truffle - save it for dessert - it doesn't go well with their tex-mex burrito! The strength of their porter is the only thing that saves this one from the kennel.
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;ugh. Amazingly this tastes just like the other Raspberry beer from Thirsty Dog, except it is darker and not quite as carbonated. For comments, see Thirsty Dog Raspberry Ale.
Thirsty Dog Raspberry Leghumper;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Great raspberry aroma that does not carry over to the flavor. I am guessing this is a blend of the Old Leghumper and Raspberry Ale, and it is a great breed. Roasted chocolate flavor and an excellent experience.

Thirsty Dog Hoppus Maximus;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Cask @ Albion, dry-hopped with Mosaic. Murky brown with sediment floating down to the bottom of the glass, medium sized beige foamy head, faint citrus aroma, low carbonation, flat sweetish caramel taste with citrus bitterness and throat-irritating chili like effect kicking in later. longish mosaic flavored hoppy finish. Interesting brew, not sure whether I liked or not.
Thirsty Dog Hoppus Maximus;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Excellent citrus malt aroma. Excellent balance between the two. Interesting seeing that their success with this one at the GABF goes back to 2001.
Thirsty Dog Hoppus Maximus;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Pours bright clear gold, admirable head. Nose of sweet gently roasted malt, parfumy flowery hops, funky lemon rind. Flavor has a substantial malt body, a perceived ripe fruitiness from the malt/hop combo at first, then malts drop out to reveal a bright grapefruit rind and flowery hop finish/linger. This definitely is a hoppy American amber, yet hop profile is very rindy, bitter, and lacks a more ripe depth. Still a solid and choice offering if you’re looking for a little bit of a pale ale kick to an amber. Their hoppiest beer, though? I sure hope not.
Thirsty Dog Hoppus Maximus;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours hazy reddish gold with a fluffy white head.

Thirsty Dog Hoppus Maximus;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This was poured into a pint glass. Bottle came from Batdorf, Annville PA. The appearance was a hazy red color with a slim bar pour’s kind of white head. The smell mainly had a malty sweet caramel malts with a subdued grassy/earthy hoppiness to it. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors to combine and give off a decent amount of light caramel notes in the aftertaste. The finish was quick. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat subdued. Overall, I say this was an okay American Amber ale that I could have again but nothing over the top.
Thirsty Dog Hoppus Maximus;Akron, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Pours a nice amber color with a good two finger head..aroma is slightly citrus..kind of a disappointment when you have a name like this..I expected a hopps bomb..not the case..flavor is malty goodness with some roasted and toffee notes..all in all avg amber brew

Pours a clear gold with a bit of an orange hue and a small off-white head that lasts as a thick ring and film and laces the glass unevenly. Notes of pumpkin spice up front - nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, ginger - graham cracker, earth, lightly roasted pumpkin, and a surprisingly big bready malt finish. Moderate level of spice in this one. More in the nose, while the flavor is maltier. Light-bodied, with modest carbonation. Pretty smooth. Not bad.
Thirsty Dog Pumpkin Ale;Akron, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. There was some light lacing all along the glass. The smell had some pumpkin up front with a nice allocation of cinnamon, allspice and ginger. The taste was there as it took the previously mentioned flavors and combined them really nicely. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium with a slight sessionability about it. Carbonation was somewhat smooth. Overall, though I can’t get this beer where I currently live, I would love to have it again some day as when I was able to have it, it was always a go to pumpkin ale.

Light bone colored head that clings to the edge of the glass. Toffee-like aroma, some light chocolate. Rich flavor, some toffee, caramel, a touch of molasses. Decently thick mouthfeel. Nice treat.
Thirsty Dog Mixed Breed;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Nice blend of two of their beers - You get the chocolate/roast of the Old Leghumper, thinned out a bit and brightened by the ale's hops. This would be an o.k. session ale.
Thirsty Dog Mixed Breed;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Not bad, but pretty bland. From the looks of it - I expected much more.....
Thirsty Dog Mixed Breed;Akron, Ohio, United States;Porter;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;A good mixture and a good balance of the two styles present in this beer. The hops in the Pale Ale complement the sweetness in the Stout. Well done.
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;California crisp has a light fruity aroma. The color is a light copper with an off white head. There is a fruity essence to the flavor with a caramel background. Crisp has a medium body and a quick clean finish.
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Deep orange brown. Layered goodness. A bitter and perfumy quality to the flavor. Carbonation light. A few off flavors induced by malts. Overall, rather papery and bland/flat. Its alright.
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"Sampled from a fresh growler. I really think Thirsty Dog could have taken this in an interesting direction- instead, it is merely a watered-down version of their ""stock"" beer. Clear amber/copper appearance, thin off-white head. Aroma opens up with grassy hops that settle into a light fruity malt matrix. Light, fruity flavor with hints of caramel, touching on candy, with grassy hops tickling the palate. Light body and light in every aspect, but not very complex or interesting."
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This was a hazy dark amber with a wisp of white head. It had a fruity, flowery aroma. Caramel and toast. It’s light and a bit sweet.
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"Smelled ""fresh"". Unlike the other hooligans at my table (Jsquire, BBB63, & Aracauna), my glass had fantastic lacing - it had to have something to do with me because this phenomonon continued throughout most of our day. Body was light, almost watery; taste had a citrusy zing down the center with (only) hints of bread. Finish was crisp and clean and left you wanting more. First brew of Drew’s Magical Mystery Tour 2004."
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Hazy orange with a very thin white head that disappeared to a ring very quickly. Very little nose. Some faint hop notes with doughy yeast hints. Refreshing because of its watery body.
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Amber hue with small head and no lace. The aroma hints of orange zest, apple, apricot, caramel, toffee, rye bread and floral hops. The taste has a mild bitterness with a fruity character, good malt balance. The mouthfeel is smooth, clean and crisp with some chalky aftertaste. A good session beer.
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Clear amber color, nice white head, very mild flavor. It's not hoppy, but certainly not sweet. I don't taste Any rye. It's an OK session or lawnmower beer. Not bad, but not great.
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This beer medaled at the GABF, not as a rye beer(which it is), but in sort of a miscellaneous category. Looks like a pale ale. Moderate white head, translusent gold color. Aroma of sweet carmel. As previously note little hops to speak of. Flavor is mostly sweet. Finish sweet and carmelly too! I liked this beer and think it would make a good session beer.
Thirsty Dog California Crisp;Akron, Ohio, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Light nose, pale amber color, sticky head. Pez candy-like taste. Odd mix of hops and malt - bac balance. Unsuccessful.

Kimmel Baltais (White);Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Bottled (BB 07/2005) Golden yellow, small white head. Grassy, plastic aroma. Medium-bodied. Some grassy hops, slightly unclean lager with some sourness.
Kimmel Baltais (White);Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;(Bottled@HBF 2005) Pale golden color with a smallish head. Slightly buttery, stingy, quite original aroma (not very pleasant). Strangely chocolatey, low-malt, low-hop flavor. Light-bodied and quite carbonated palate. A light, quite unclean brew.
Kimmel Baltais (White);Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Hazy, honey light golden color. Not really characteristic of a lager. White, thin head. Not a whole bunch of carbonation. Light malty aroma with a little hop note. Light mouthfeel, almost like Fraoch, hints of heather maybe? Not a bad brew, refreshing.
Kimmel Baltais (White);Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Light yellow color with a small white head. A lighter less offensive version of their original.
Kimmel Baltais (White);Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;After the last Kimmel I tried, I don''t know why I decided to try another, but the White cried out to me. I procede. Pours a cloudy light golden color with a head that turns into little wax islands floating on the top. Smells a bit like sourdough bread dough with a touch of light vinegar and goat cheese. Once again, rather complex. Tin, blood and a touch of caramel flavor, with a sharp bitterness in the finish that leads to a rather rusty vapid afterglow ending. I realy must stop my morosistic, masochistic, martyrdom with this brewery! My head hurts!
Kimmel Baltais (White);Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Golden coloured, rich head. Spicy aroma. Medium bodied, sweet, big funky cellar flavour.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;A fairly decent selection, although very weak in all categories. Perhaps this beers best feature was its appearance, reminiscent of an amber ale.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Bottled (BB 08/2005) Pale yellow, mostly vanishing white head. Sour, grassy, malty aroma. Grassy, malty and slightly sweet flavor. Boring.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;"Amber honey with a decent 3/4"" head. The aroma is fairly good with a balance of malt and hops. Taste is thin."
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;This bottled brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized white colored long lasting bubbles that left behind a good lace. The body is carbonated hazy and dark yellow brown in color. It had a sweet lager aroma and an odd metallic mouth feel that was somewhat off. The flavor was metallic and malty. It was not a good brew, but it was also not an awful brew. I'll not voluntarily buy this one again while there are so many better brews readily available.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Bottle. This beer formed a small sized white head that was creamy with fine-small sized bubbles that fully diminished. The body was semi-transparent with fast rising carbonation and a pale yellow hue. The nose was malty, lightly hoppy and sweet. The flavor was bitter and it had a lingering aftertaste that was unpleasant. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth. This was a light bodied beer with sparse lacing. I was unimpressed with this beer overall.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Pale yellow with clumps of 'wanna-be' head bubbles floating on top. Some corn in the nose, slight hint of grassy hop. Tastes surprisingly like Cheerios breakfast cereal, very dull. Some grassiness at the finish, as in the nose.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Sweet whole grain flavors. Fairly harmless all around, but overall pretty lame.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Nice pale tan white body, no real head. Smell is subtle yeast. The taste is very bland--not good, like the moment before you puke. The terrible taste lingers well after you are finished drinking it.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Clear gold color with a small white head. Pleasant grain aroma initially that turns more cornlike upon warming. The taste and aftertaste have an unpleasant grain taste and bitterness.
Kimmel Rigas Originalais;Riga, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kimmels Riga;Not horrible, by any means. Too sugary for a lager of the type, I think, but the aroma contains some bitterness and so does the close of the flavor, but it is a little thick and indistinct. Hey, it's summer!
Kimmel Porteris;Riga, Latvia;Porter - Baltic;Kimmels Riga;Very dark reddish brown. Big unpleasant apple and cellar aroma. Sweet, medium bodied, fatty and unclean. I'm afraid this is the worst porter I've tried.
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;0.5 l bottle. Sampled in Riga. Pours deep mahogany with khaki head. Bready malt aroma along with some light hop scent. Nice full mouthfeel, it is thick and malty. Some nutty, caramely flavors. Not much sweetness, which earns it points. Some off flavors/armoas like dirty dishwater, as well. And a little bitterness in the aftertaste. An ok Latvian dark.
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;"Bottled as ""Kimmel Rigas Tumsais"" (BB 02/2007). Dark rubycolor, good tan head. Sweet caramelly aroma of fudge. Medium-bodied. Creamy mouthfeel. Caramelly with malty finish. Sort of ""the brewery is not the most modern"" -feeling here - some flavors are unclean."
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;Bottled dark red. Sweet malty caramel aroma. Malty slight sweet, quite good beer.
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;Bottled. Ruby red colour, small beige head. Aroma at first quite caramnellish and malty. Flavour at this point was caramellish malty too. Once it gets a bit warmer both flavour and aroma starts to live. Flavour gets a bit sweetness, fruitishness and plums in it. Flavour gets Sweet malts, caramel, a weak sting of alcohol and some hoppyness in it. So, I would say, good session beer both warm and cold. Oh well, it seems like a beer which is kind of divided, hate it or love it... I’ll compromise and like it.
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;"Dark brown color, little vanishing head. Caramel and malty aroma, this seems to be common to these local ""tumsais"" beers. Differing from other local dunkels, this is not so full bodied and sweet flavored, this only has lots of carbonation and strong hops. Dark beer that tastes like bad pale one, absolutely NOT one of my favourites."
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;Horrible horrible beer. The Latvians I know wont even touch the stuff. Has to be ice cold to drink. I had a customer explain the taste. He said it was like eating browned hamburger. That's not really good.
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;"Deep amber brown color with a foamy beige head. Nearly no aroma, perhaps a bit of celery. Light fruity flavors of the front, turning to a cheap cream sherry taste. A strange lager that tastes better as it gets warmer. Actually not as bad as the other Kimmel products I have tried, but certainly not a ""quality"" brew."
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;Man this was just a bad beer. Save yourself the trouble and buy a different dark beer. Just bad.
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;Not very good really. kind of nice color, but a taste that can only be descibed as bad. Tastes like something died inside and rotted a bit before I opened it. But it did look kind of tasty.
Kimmel Tumsais (Dark);Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kimmels Riga;Sweet caramel aroma and even looks somewhat appetizing, but it has a very strange flavor profile. It does kinda taste spoiled. The aroma is actually more like used cooking oil. The bitterness is way off balance and the malt flavor tastes artificial. I kinda feel bad for the people of Latvia.
Kimmel Rigas Stiprais (Strong);Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Kimmels Riga;Bottled Kimmel Rigas Stiprais, golden with short malt aroma. Too sweet taste to be good.
Kimmel Rigas Stiprais (Strong);Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Kimmels Riga;Bottled. Grain aroma with a hint of citrus. Golden color, white head, good lace. Light sweet, light bitter, lemon flavor, medium body. Straightforward and very drinkable.
Kimmel Rigas Stiprais (Strong);Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Kimmels Riga;Bottled. Had it as Kimmel Rigas Stiprais, 7%. Golden colour, huge white bubbly/foamish head. Kiwifruitish aroma. Sweet caramellish fruity flavour. Also some hints of alcohol in the flavour. Gives a bit oily mouthfeel. Could do with a bit more bitterness, as I felt it was too sweet for me. 6363 12 Re-rated 17.12.2005 Kimmel Rigas stiprais (bottled.) 7%. Golden coloured, big foamy/bubbly head. Aroma is sweet caramel, fuit and alcohol. Flavour mainly sweet alcohol, fruit and caramel. Also some balancing hops, which makes the flavour quite good. Aftertaste is pleasant, but flavour while drinking not too good. 43539
Kimmel Rigas Stiprais (Strong);Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Kimmels Riga;"Had this one labeled at ""Riga’s stiprais"", brewer is Kimmel so these must be same beers. Starts and ends with sweet malty taste, sweetness lasts very long in mouth. Hint of warming alcohol in palate. Too sweet for my taste, maybe some carbonation or hops would have done it."
Kimmel Rigas Stiprais (Strong);Riga, Latvia;Pilsener - Imperial;Kimmels Riga;Amber coloured. Apple and cellar aroma. Medium bodied, very sweet, clean finish.

Piebalgas Minhauzena Alus;Jaunpiebalga, Jaunpiebalgas novads, Latvia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Piebalgas Alus;"Keg (Riga Beer Festival 2010) 5 Initially almost nothing, as the keggy head smothered all the aroma. Getting close, there was some dusty hops, and perhaps some ginger. As it warms, there are lots of herby grassy hops 3 Rich gold, large light white head. 5 A full grassy and herby hoppy body. Packed full of grains, but also other vegetable matter too. Quite bizarre, but very much Piebalgas. 3+ Soft palate, decent carbonations. Finish very hoppy - a touch papery, but green too. Vegetal in places too. 9 A well crafted and interesting beer, but not to my taste so much. Anna adds ""Only a little bit shit in the taste""."

Harrisons Millennium Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"Well, it’s OK I suppose. It’s ""flat"", my term, for a beer that’s supposed to have at least some hop character. Not as much as an IPA, mind you, but definitely, not on par with other pale ales. Too much malt in the background for my taste. Glad I tried it, but wouldn’t repeat."
Harrisons Millennium Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;On-tap into a pint glass... This was suppose to be the best beer they had, probably was but still not saying a whole lot... Pours a totally clear dark orange with notes of copper, looks good. The head is a nice off white, good retention and lace... The aroma is also pretty good, mostly grassy on the front with a hint of caramel, pine hop finish... The taste is decent at first, light toffee and grass. The finish becomes way too bitter, hops are off, reminds me more of an ipa. Not terrible but I wouldn’t have this again unless my prison was Harrison’s and I was sentenced to life without parole.
Harrisons Millennium Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;This one was okay. Aroma of caramel and sweet. Brownish amber color red. Taste is hoppy, slightly sweet, low malt. Will not have again, but I’m not a fan of pale ales

Harrisons Millennium Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Clear, dark red pour with an off-white head, a wonderfully hoppy, floral nose. Pronounced hoppiness thorughout, nice and dry with some red grape fruitiness. Clean and excellent.
Harrisons Millennium Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Draft sampler.There are some hops at work here. A bit pine, grapefruit and even peach (the impression left over from the peach beer.). Malts are a little lacking for what the color suggests, but it does play nice and finish with a decent pale ale flourish.
Harrisons LaGrange Golden Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;On-tap into a pint glass... A medium but lightly murky straw, off looking. However, the head is great. A bright white that has great retention and totally thick and coating lacing that looks great... The aroma is really light and boring, a hint of grain... The taste is light skunk from start to finish, that’s it. A very HARSH bitter finish that really ruins a basically boring but unoffensive beer. Pass.
Harrisons LaGrange Golden Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Aroma is corn, pilsner color, taste is light. tastes like miller lite with a tad bit more hops and malts. This light beer actually has taste. Aftertaste is crisp..

Harrisons LaGrange Golden Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;clear yellow, slight white head, some lacing, too watery looking. grassy, wheaty aroma, a stronger nose than i expected for a light beer. creamy, corny flavor. full mouth-feel, fizzy. kind of a ’salty’ finish. not as bad as i feared, but in the end, the ’saltiness’ was ultimately distracting.
Harrisons LaGrange Golden Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Clear light yellow pour with a grassy nose, dry, a bit hoppy, well balanced. Kind of bland for the style, though. Not much going on.
Harrisons LaGrange Golden Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Draft Sampler. Well, yes, a light beer, and what else could I expect. Very little taste, but does show a certain ale fruitiness. I would be hard pressed to guess what style this was based on. Suspect some rice was involved in keeping it so light. Hops were weak to me.
Harrisons LaGrange Golden Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"Clear, transparent and watery yellow in color with rising bubbles and a white wrung for the head. Lemons, cornflakes and starch spray provide the cleansing aroma. Yeasty and effervescent upon all quaffs. Flavor circumvents bready crescent rolls traits with a touch of stinging lemons. Definitely one of the hoppier ""lite"" beers (cascade, primarily) and well balanced, for what it’s worth."
Harrisons LaGrange Golden Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Light golden bodied served with a white ring of a head. No aromas detected (which I suppose is better than detecting bad aromas). Very mild hop presence in flavor but weak overall with a slightly metallic finish.

Please stop with the trend towrds ""light"" ""lo-carb"", ""lo-calorie"", ""lo-alcohol"" etc. Beer is not a diet drink. If you are trying to lose weight, please drink something else...somewhere else."
Harrisons LaGrange Golden Light;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;This is like am introductory ale for those who normally drink macro lagers. Pale yellow with a light head, it had little of any aroma. Kind of watery in the mouth. Little taste. Clean finish. Harrisons Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL
Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;On-tap into a tasting glass... Pours an ugly dirty honey gold, ugly head, served with a lemon slice!... The aroma is dead, nothing going on at all... The taste is bad lemon and wheat, very chemical, terrible finish that is stale cloves and wheat. Big time pass.
Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;orange/yellow color, cloudy and served with lemon. Smells lemon, light banana. Taste is light banana, but does not taste like typical hafeweizen with heavy banana and clove taste. I’m assuming a traditional Wyeast haffeweizen yeast was not used in this one. A light, tasty hafeweizen..

Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;hazy apricot body, slight white head. served with a slice of lemon??! i didn’t detect any aroma once i discarded the lemon. flavor of spices, and banana tones. the banana was not off-putting. the mouth feel was a bit effervescent, in a weird way. i don’t care for wheats, but this wasn’t too bad.
Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Pours cloudy light orange color with a thick, white head that dissipated to a pervasive film, very faint citrus in the nose, light wheat, alcoholic finish. Meh.
Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Draft sampler. Well, yes it does have a cloudy wheat character and a sort of lacy foam. Can’t smell much beyond the lemon slice on the glass. Actually bears more of a resemblance to Belgian, with its cloudy pink-tinged yellow body. Just a touch of coriander, then a bit of sourness makes this a but more interesting than my rating might suggest.
Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Served with a lemon wedge (damn.) Dirty, murky and solid pale yellow-gold in color with a few bubble cloisters on the top, but fairly stagnant in appearance overall. Aroma is very subdued - banana, vanilla and lemons at best. Flavor is absolutely repulsive. Cat nip, pineapple, rutabaga and acorn squash. Hops are doing something unforgivable. I will forever remember this one.
Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;One of the blandest wheats I ever had...no aroma, little flavor (watered down) and thin palate. Skip this one.
Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"I’m not a wheat beer afficianado, but this beer wasn’t bad. I only took spare notes on it: murky-tan; no head/white ring; fizzy; mild; smooth. Harrison’s Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL"
Harrisons Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;A fairly bland wheat with little discernable aroma. It looked nice in the glass, a cloudy yellow color with a frothy head. Not much in the flavor area. A bit watery... which leads to the very clean finish. Harrisons Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL
Harrisons Red;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"Wow, I pretty bad red in my opinion. A lot of malt with almost no hops. It seemed very ""empty"" to me. I’ve had way better amber ales. Thankfully this one was just a taster sample :)"
Harrisons Red;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"On-tap into a taster... This one starts off really nice. A bright clear medium copper, hints of amber. The head is a nice tope color, great retention, looks good... The aroma is light with notes of rye and a hint of toffee; a little generic but unoffensive... The taste is horrible, fuesal alcohol finish with a bit of toffee. Was this the base beer for BA 1000 IBU? Tastes like burning."
Harrisons Red;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;This one was good. Red amber color. Sweet nose, caramel also. Sweet flavor. Chocolate/crystal malts used for sure. Maybe wilamette and liberty hops used. Mild hops, mild malts. The brew needs more malt though and make it a medium body opposed to a lighter body. My irish red was better that I brewed in November. Great beer to drink with a burger or steak.

Harrisons Red;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Pours a clear, deep copper tone, with a fluffy, off white head, faint citrus in the nose, very mild maltiness, would be a great session beer but lacks oomph. Finishes clean.
Harrisons Red;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Transparent and magnifying amber with a tan wrung for the head. Caramel, honey roasted peanuts, hops and rye give it a snappy nose. Munich malts make their presence known, churning a whole wheat bread persona. Caramel, wheat, peat and rye provide the rest of the flavor fillers. Seemingly an Irish Red by all means except the ingredient list.
Harrisons Red;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Also surprised at the improvement in this one from my last visit. Rich toffee maltiness nicely balanced by signifigant hop bitterness. Much better since my last review.
Harrisons Red;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;A clear, deep copper with an ecru head. Caramel malt aromas under piney hops. Rounded flavor, albeit a little weak. Fizzy mouthfeel with an astringent finish. Harrison’s Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL
Harrisons Red;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Draft. Not quite the disaster I remember when I was last here 3 years ago. Think the current brewmaster has been trying to get management to care about what they had treated as a mere adjunct to yuppie steaks and cigars... Deep amber color under a thin, slightly lacy head. Clearly force carbonated, and therefore gassy. Still, some lightly roasted and crystal malts with a bit of fruity esters. A bit of hop spiceness to finish off.
Harrisons Raspberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;On-tap at this place...Pours an ugly dark murky hone gold, just ugly. A light tope head, not much going on there... The aroma is asisnely sweet, generic tart raspberries, tons of sugar, yuck... The taste is one of the most chemically plastic beers I’ve ever had. Raspberry cough syrup barrel aged in plastic, barf... The mouthfeel is bad, acidic and biting. Needless to say this is terrible and should be avoided.
Harrisons Raspberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Raspberry reddish.yellow haze color, berry nose. tastes like wheat with infused slight raspberry taste. No extract in this brew. Great session beer and could definitely try again. If I had to take a growler home, this would be the brew..

Harrisons Raspberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Pours a cloudy, dark yellow color with a pervasive thick white head, nose of baked bread and raspberry jam, lightly wheaty with lots of breadiness and fruitiness. Tart in the end. Pretty good.
Harrisons Raspberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;The fruity flavor has been toned down from past years, but it doesn’t make it more enjoyable to drink.
Harrisons Raspberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Draft sampler. Well, there’s certainly raspberry here, but what else. A Belgian would be inherently fruity in taste, and just adding an overwhelming flavor like raspberry would just blow it away. Cloudy like a wit, no doubt, and as I go through the sampler while writing this, I am starting to pick a bit staled hops taste that I wouldn’t expect. Bland, but certainly no disaster.
Harrisons Raspberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Lightly hazy and pale yellow in color with some rising bubbles. Aroma consists of strawberries, raspberry jam and rose tea. Flavor ensues with a sugary charge. Lemon bite in a small sense and something suspiciously familiar with raspberry flavored seltzer water. Better than expected, for what it’s worth.
Harrisons Raspberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;They have no business experimenting at this brewpub. Tastes like raspberry NEHI and has the same over-carbonation, but the tickling distracted me from the flavor, so I bumped up the palate a point in gratitude.
Harrisons Raspberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Cloudy and wheat-colored with a ring for a head. Raspberry aromas (go figure). Sour fruit flavors, with the berries tasting like an integral part of the beer (as opposed to their Blueberry Wheat). Dry finish. Refreshing. Harrison’s Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL
Harrisons Maibock;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;I have no idea what they were going for with this. My waitress even warned me it was bad. Has no resemblance even in appearance to a maibock: it's kind of a reddish amber, practically no head. Flavor is cloyingly sweet, and finishes with a gut-wrenching olive oil taste that required a lot of water to rinse away.
Harrisons Maibock;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Brown and bubbling with no head or lace. Sweet malt aroma with a sugary sweet start. Watery and thin with slight drying finish but leaves sugary aftertaste.
Harrisons Blueberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;cloudy yellow, frothy white head, nice lacing. aroma of blueberries and hint of grain. flavor of blueberries, malt, grain. kind of watery mouth-feel, with a bitter-tart finish. kind of frizzy. fruit beers are not an endeared variety to me.
Harrisons Blueberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;On tap at the brewpub: This was a hazy dark straw in body with a bubbly head. Way too strong on the blueberry, one of the few fruits that I do not care for, and an artificial aroma and flavor to boot. It took quite a while to stop burping this stuff up.
Harrisons Blueberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Hazy dark yellow pour with a great foamy head, pronounced nose of baked blueberry muffins, wheaty and sweet but the blueberries are not overpowering the flavor very quaffable and refreshing. ! I continue to be bewildered at the low ratings for this place by some of my collegues here.
Harrisons Blueberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;some fella from indiana poured this for me at DLD. i dont even know why i’m bothering to rate it, except perhaps that i had it early and remember it well. it sucked. i remember pretending it was good and the blueberry wasn’t artificial tasting. it actually kinda was, and the beer was totally uninspired otherwise. hardly any flavor, probably 3-4% in alcohol. this is the closest thing to water I had that day.
Harrisons Blueberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Once you taste the obviously artificial blueberry syrup (and recoil from the heavy hand at work when adding it to the brew) you will have great difficulty finishing a pint of this stuff. I drank it to the last drop, but I’m a moron.
Harrisons Blueberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Looked nice enough, with a cloudy, wheat beer appearance. Aromas dominated by artificial blueberry (very similar to General Mills’ BooBerry® cereal). Fizzy mouthfeel begins a cream soda based flavor with that lingering artificial berriness. I actually rejected the second half of my sample. Sad. Harrison’s Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL
Harrisons Blueberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Bright fruity nose. I agree on the cough syrup flavor. Maybe sort of a spiced apple cake. Not too bad on the mouthfeel, but lacking overall.
Harrisons Blueberry Wheat;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Blueberry nose, very slight cloudiness with many carbonation bubbles. Taste is all blueberry, no beer...more like a blueberry soda.
Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;dark, light fruit, hoppy. All Ipas taste the same to me, but this one was more fruity then most. Not a fan. F

Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Had this one on draught at the brewpub in Orland Park, Illinois. Cask ale, hand pumped. Dark red, hazy pour, with a big, bubby foamy head, very bitter with notes of rose, lots of hops. Outstanding.
Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Cask. Semi-cloudy and ruby-amber-orange in color with a moon rock pocked head, resembling krausen in fine form. Grapefruit and grass stains instantly capture the nose for loving longevity, pursued by strawberry magic markers, freesia buds and lemon grass. It’s quite alluring at this stage of the game. Mild clover and mango bitterness creeps in with a waxy rhubarb drone. Flavor evolutions revolve around EKG hop pellets – sucking and absorbing the alpha acids as if it’s an oral prophylactic. Acidic and very green at the stems with a dry creeping bitterness that spans from the rooftop of the mouth and works its way down. Marigolds and ragweed tickle the tonsils with alcohol swab status, but it’s surprisingly enjoyable yet incorrigible. Pollinated hops spurge forth with post-gestational burps while buffed mango rinds and earthen chomped dandelions bring up the rear.
Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Served room temperature as an incredibly dense hazelnut/copper with a creamy head that laced in a solid sheet. Aromas are grapefruit with dishrag and acrid notes. Flavor holds thorough bitterness with citric notes but nothing too special. Mouth is sticky with a dry finish. On cask at Harrison’s Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL 60462
Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"Nitro pint at Harrison’s. This may be improving under their new brewer, but still needs a long way to go. served properly ""warm"" and hand-pulled. A thin head that coats instead of lacing the glass. Cloudy orange color. Slight biscuity malt that’s overwhelmed by hop bitterness. A touch or earth, grapefruit and pine needles, but mostly just bitter. A perceptible alcohol burn, too. Yes, Mabel, there is an aftertaste, so I don’t see it being ordered by many of the cigar-smoking yuppies here. I think Harrison’s is slowly improving, but they need to learn more subtlety."
Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Cask-conditioned, served at room temperature...This cloudy brew had a slight grapefruit- hoppy aroma, and even knowing better, I hoped against hope for that slight promise to be fulfilled...but instead I got dishwater that made up for it with a slightly vinyl finish. Please, I’m begging you, just stop brewing beer before someone gets hurt!
Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;"Nitro version served at room temperature: Actually not a bad IPA, looking a murky orange/brown color with an off-white head. Nice pine & herbal hop aroma. I was told that this was ""real hoppy,"" but the flavor didn’t strike this 3F drinker that way. Not too bad, with an earthy hop flavor and a very mild malting underneath. Lingering bitter pine finish. Harrisons Brewing Company, Orland Park, IL"
Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Cask: Dark orange color with a nice head. The smell is terrific with hops. The taste is little to be desired. It tasted old and lacked something. Not a bad beer, but disappointing after the smell.
Harrisons India Pale Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Harrison's Brewery and Restaurant;Cask: Perhaps the best of their beers. Murky golden color with a subtle hop nose. Some nutty textures. Not big at all, and really unassuming.
Black Mountain Bighorn Bock;Cave Creek, Arizona, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Black Mountain Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewpub, adjacent to the brewery in Cave Creek, AZ. Pours a clear caramel amber brew with a thick, creamy off-white head that has some good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, some candi sugar, and a touch of honey. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with flavors of sweetened caramel malt, some candi sugar than its aroma and some cotton candy. Finish is semi-sweet, slightly metallic as the brewmaster told me it’s 8% alcohol, with some candi sugar aftertaste. It’s different.

Thirsty Dog Wheatweiler;Akron, Ohio, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This bottled brew from the brewery poured a large sized head of of unnoted size quickly diminishing clear bubbles that left behind an unnoted lacing. The body contained average carbonation, was hazy and yellow in color. Its aroma contained notes of mild bready malts. Its flavor contained smooth mild astringent wheat notes. Very disappointing.

Hazy dark yellowish-orange with a thin white head. Aroma is light wheat and citrus. Light-bodied with a slick yeasty flavor, along with a little citrus and hops. Finish is a little on the thin side, even for a Wheat. This would be a good brew as part of their 15 beer sampler but I would not get it again otherwise.

Very light yellow straw color with a slight honey aroma. Very grainy and quite unimpressive. There lightest beer that they had when i was there, certainly they have better things to drink.
Callys Honey Blonde Ale;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);On tap at Cally’s. Clear golden blond body with a medium creamy white head. Sweet grainy aroma with light honey. Very sweet honey flavor, light grainy ending. Fairly smooth body with medium high carbonation.
Callys Honey Blonde Ale;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Draft at Cally’s. Probably wouldn’t have tried this in the first place other than another rating on ratebeer :-) Fairly lackluster, clear golden pour with a slim white head. Good carbonation, but that’s about it. Really have to stretch myself to find something in this one. Probably cally’s easiest drinking beer next to their american wheat.
Callys Honey Blonde Ale;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Pretty nondistinct beer. Had to work to find the aroma and flavor. Calhouns weakest link of the beers available now. It could have been a Busch.
Callys Honey Blonde Ale;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Draft at the brewpub, labeled Blonde Ale instead of Honey Blonde Ale. Medium golden color with white head. Aromas of light malt, copper, and faint floral hops. Flavor is very lager-like malt with a crisp, slightly bitter finish. Surprisingly good, and certainly heavier than I would think a macro-lite drinker would wish, especially at 5%.
Callys Honey Blonde Ale;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);"Medium to deep gold, good head, no real aroma at all. Sort of an inoffensive ""beer"" flavor, touch of grain, predominate note is just a general sweetness. This is definitely the beer on tap for the Budmiloors crowd. Not my bag."
Maplewood Farms The Intimidator Double Bock;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Maplewood Farms;"Sample at the brewpub. Clear very dark brown, no head. Absolutely huge malty gingerbread nose with whiffs if cinnamon and anise. Big sugary-sweet malty flavor, no hops to speak of; perhaps a bit too syrupy without the stronger hop foundation and heavier body. Still very very good; just a bit smoky near the finish."
Maplewood Farms The Intimidator Double Bock;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Maplewood Farms;On tap at the brewpub: Ruby orange with a thin head. Deep caramel and malts in the nose. Oily full body. Very sweet ending that is a bit too much. Otherwise a great brew.
Maplewood Farms The Intimidator Double Bock;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Maplewood Farms;Has a dark ruby color and a somewhat sweet malted smell. Taste is malted, but not as much as some of the other doppelbock I have tried and it finishes with a funny aftertaste. Actually all the beers in the sampler had a funny aftertaste, hmmmm... Overall this is one of my least favorite from this brewery. It didn't taste right...
Maplewood Farms The Intimidator Double Bock;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Maplewood Farms;They refer to it as a dopplebock, to me it tastes more like a Belgian Strong, and every bit as good as the ones highly rated here, but those dont particularly do it for me either.
Maplewood Farms Minuteman Gold;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maplewood Farms;Well I tried this beer in a sample platter with five others so tyake this with a grain of salt. Has a medium yellow color and a hop smell. Taste is of hops and finishes with a medium bitterness. Overall it is similar to an IPA, but smoother and not as bitter.
Maplewood Farms Minuteman Gold;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Maplewood Farms;Tastes a lot like an IPA, with its rich hoppieness. A nice beautiful golden appearance and rich hoppy smell. A good beer.
San Rafael Pale Ale;Norvato, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Rafael Brewing Co.;On tap at the San Mateo Brewfest. Not sure why this is retired because I just had it on Sunday 6/10/07. This was a great pale ale. Nice big citrus aroma and flavor. Body was medium but still refreshing. Some caramel malt and alcohol to back everything up. Yum.
San Rafael Pale Ale;Norvato, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Rafael Brewing Co.;By far the worst beer I ever had. I have to assume this beer is bottled conditioned because the amount of yeast in the bottle was very surprising as was what I can only hope was grains floating around in the bottle. Everey single bottle was filled to a different amount. Some filled to the very top others have an inch and a half of space. The taste...well it was awful. The only explanation I can have is that this beer was sent to market prematurely because it tasted nothing like a pale ale or even beer for that matter.
San Rafael Pale Ale;Norvato, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Rafael Brewing Co.;"(12 oz bottle: BevMo in La Jolla, CA) Pour the beer, smell the beer, taste the beer, rate the beer, dump what’s left. The nose of this beer is sweet and extremely grainy and corn-flavored. The flavor is similar; it’s lightly malty, strongly corn-flavored, and fairly sweet, but the sweetness just seems cheap tasting. The hops is mildy bitter, but doesn’t have much character. Light-to-medium bodied, but the sweet corn flavor quickly becomes tiring on the palate. Dark golden color seemed promising on the pour, but those hopes were dashed when the cheap aromas hit the nasal passages. Light tan head fades to a ring in a few minutes. Some patching lacing here and there. And just think, I bought a six pack of this crap. So sorry I sent a bottle of this to Bert. This is garbage, but it’s a rating I guess."
San Rafael Pale Ale;Norvato, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Rafael Brewing Co.;Small tan head, lasting. Clear coppper color. Subdued piney hop nose with a fair bit of malt. Light body. Light malt flavors, caramel and light piney hop notes with an unfortunate astringency/ Quick dry finish. Thanks Stephen!
San Rafael Pale Ale;Norvato, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Rafael Brewing Co.;Bottled: This is just a bad beer. Light tasting, not very hoppy, but had a horrible after taste. Won't buy it again.
San Rafael Pale Ale;Norvato, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Rafael Brewing Co.;Medium Brown color, large head. Very hoppy, nice maltyness. Finish is crisp, no bitterness in aftertaste. Doesn't really taste like a pale ale.
San Rafael Pale Ale;Norvato, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;San Rafael Brewing Co.;A modest pale ale, light, slightly worty, easy on the hops, crisp and solid
Manayunk India Pale Ale (pre - 2006);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;This one is very good. It does remind me of Hop Wallop and Ruination, although not as citrusy as Hop Wallop or as astringent as Ruination. Great hop presence, and great balance. Get some while you can.
Manayunk India Pale Ale (pre - 2006);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;I had this at the Michael Jackson beer tasting in Philadelphia in 2005 and I loved it. What a great surprise. Hopped with Centenial and Cascade like a Hop Devil, with great malt taste, bitterness, and orange and pine complexity, but with enough simcoe to give it a crisp almost miny taste like a Hop Wallop. A favorite now, along with Hop Wallop and Stone Ruination, though less grapefruity than either. May not be for everyone ... this is a real slam of hops.
Manayunk India Pale Ale (pre - 2006);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;A decent pale ale, not quite an IPA in my book. Not sure where the overpowering hops are. A touch of vanilla.
Manayunk India Pale Ale (pre - 2006);Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;"This beer reminds me of Stone's Arrogant Bastard and Victory's Hop Devil... and yet it is slightly more refined and truly unique. A Bronze medal winner at the 2002 World Beer Cup, this beer offers a uniquely fresh profile in that it is bottle conditioned! It pours a cream colored, 1/4"" head that holds fairly well, and offers an incredibly intense hop aroma of both American and English hops; well backed by a sweet caramel maltiness. The moutheel is creamy and full with a medium level carbonation. The flavor is equally balanced between sharp hop flavor and sweet caramel maltiness. The finish is on the sweet side, turning dry, and finally revealing a ton of hop flavor. Unlike any beer I've ever had before; although the original brewer has left and this beer has not been even remotely the same in recent versions."
Schlafly Wheat Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;An okay wheat ale. Pale a very light. Lots of citrus. Sweetness lingers, but otherwise not much lasting character. Tried for the first time back in 2007 and only now adding the rating.
Schlafly Wheat Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Dry Hopped Wheat-on cask-pours a white bubbly head and hazy yellow color. Aroma is lemon. Taste is lemon/lemon zest/tea/some spice hops, wheat. Light body.
Schlafly Wheat Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;On tap at the tap room. It’s fine, and plenty drinkable. There’s just not much to it.
Schlafly Wheat Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Very clear and golden with a staying head. Crisp, clean, vaguely fruity. Nicely balanced with unique light grain flavors. Kolsch-like, refreshing.
Schlafly Wheat Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Ugggghhh. THis was bad, macro bad. Wet cardboard flavors. Uhhhh. What a bad beer to have started the fest with.
Schlafly Wheat Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Pale and clear. A typical American Wheat - which means I didn't like it much.
Schlafly Wheat Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;Light bodied wheat ale. For the American Standard drinkers. Better than anything AB makes.Since Saint Louis Brewery ( the tap room) does not sell any beer but their own.
Schlafly Wheat Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Saint Louis Brewery;"As the description reads, this is the filtered version of the Schlafly Hefe. The flavor doesn't gain any extra ""wheatiness"", but loses some of the yeastiness, as is obviously to be expected. Light bodied, and a lighter mouthfeel as compared with the regular version. This is one of those ""it'll please the non-beer connoisseur"" types of brews, but it's not bad."
Wynkoop Sagebrush Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap @ Wynkoop Brewery. Deep dark black with a persistant dark tan head. Smells of chocolate, coffee grounds, and lightly roasted malt. Taste is wonderfully chocolatey and roasty. The chocolate is kinda bitter like bakers cocoa. Some espresso notes hit through the finish, as well as some subtle fruitiness. Not too bitter but pretty sweet. A fine dessert beer, and a fine stout.
Wynkoop Sagebrush Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Tap at Wynkoop. Pours a deeper brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma of chocolate, nuts and toasted malt. Flavor of chocolate, nuts, toffee. Nice chocolate character.
Wynkoop Sagebrush Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a black body with a finger-width, creamy, brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is rich chocolate, soft oats, and roasty coffee. A light earthy metallic and some caramel too. Flavor is the same. Rich, sweet, and smooth chocolate oats with a good amount of roasty coffee. Finishes smooth and rich with a light, earthy bitterness and dry roastiness. Aftertaste that lingers for a lengthy duration after a medium, somewhat watery at times, but creamy body. Overall, a tasty stout. The metallic hint in the aroma didn’t show up in the flavor which was nice. Serverd at a warmer temperature too, which I appreciate. Not bad.
Wynkoop Sagebrush Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Old review from 2000 I never posted. Well-made stout, good roasted aromas and flavors, smooth and flavorful with a nice finish.
Wynkoop Sagebrush Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at brewery for GABF 08. Dark pour with tan head. Roasted malts, chocolate and oatmeal. Flavor is the same, with a bit of milkiness.

The beer pours a solid black color with a medium thin light brown head that diminishes slowly. Rings of lacing. Roasted malt and coffee aroma, with notes of chocolate and hops. Medium-bodied with a roasty character that is predominantly coffee and malt. Some milk chocolate is present as well. The finish is moderately bitter coffee and hops and it lingers awhile. Pretty solid overall.
Wynkoop Sagebrush Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Draught at Wynkoop. Black - light brown head. Licorice, roasted, berries, dryness, burned, red berries, caramel, butterscotch, high sweetness, a bit too much sweetness. Lovely burned.
Wynkoop Sagebrush Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Dark black with a brown head. Sort of tasted a little like a barley wine because you could taste the alcohol. Almost light-medium bodied. Decent choice, but they have better.
Wynkoop Sagebrush Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Pitch black color, with a sweet oatmeal cereal roasty malt, mochaish nose, with a light chocolatey icecream aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a smooth, roasted malt, toffeeish, winey character, with some dark dried fruits, maybe more plummy, with a light dark chocolate accent, leading towards a fruity, roasted, lingering bitternees finish.
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;An orange beer with a small disappearing off-white head. The aroma is lovely hoppy combined with sweet caramel notes. The flavor is sweet with notes of caramel and oranges leading to a dry end - but before that the body seems weak in the begining.
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Does this beer even have a flavor or taste? Nope. Does it have an aroma? Nope. I had this beer at the brewery in Denver and it had zero taste, zero flavor, zero aroma. I actually sent it back/dumped it for another fairly bland beer. I have never had such a crappy IPA in my life and suggest it be avoided.
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Tasted in Colorado (Denver). Tasted at Wynkoop Brewing Company. Liver is going to quit - I am NOT. Must complete my mission. Who does number 2 work for? (oops, wrong movie - bad timing). Deep deep copper colour. Sooo deep. White fluffy cumulous head, I see angels dancing on the peaks. Again, such a fruity aroma - mother of pearl. Taste is an orchestra of subtlety and destruction.
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;pretty standard. some pine and lychee in aroma, but way too sticky, hint of mango nectar, lower bitterness than expected
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Clear red appearance. Biscuity, hopy aroma. Low in carbonation (cask), sweet tropical fruit and biscuity malt with a good citric bite in the finish. Rated low because it’s my favorite style and I was not impressed.
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub: Clear orange with a big white head. Citrus aroma, solid body. Starts and ends moderately bitter. If this beer had a high ABV, I didn't notice it.
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;When I first tasted this IPA my nose was kinda FUBAR, and I was kinda out of it too... West coast hops, a nice, lasting head, the IPA itself is slightly opaque. I liked it... I know thats not saying much but my notes are kinda crappy here... The bitterness is not too extreme, and it blends into a light sweetness. The palate is rather thin.
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;(cask) Slightly hazy dark gold. Flimsy white head, reasonably stable. very fruity nose (exotic fruit as passion) and yeasty - smelling like green beer. Well-bitter taste with both noble and bitter hops. Enough malts underneath to support, without sweetening. Well-bodied. Aftertaste turns out malt-sweet. Nice one. But Imperial?
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Cask at the Appaloosa Grill in downtown Denver, owned by Wynkoop. Cascase hop aroma. Slightly murky, with some soft orange colors and a white head. A little thin, lacking the needed carbonation, even for a cask conditioned IPA. some chalcky and stale wheat flavors. Aroma sets it up, but the flavor is a let down.
Wynkoop Imperial IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Light amber colour with a thin white head. Served at cellar temperature. A pleasant english hop aroma comes from the beer. In addition to the hops, there is a bit of sweetness. The taste is almost purely of malt and english hops. Once again this is a tiny bit watery, but not as much as the others. Aftertaste is a subtle malt with prominent english hops. This was most closely related to a bitter, but possibly could be considered an EPA, but definately not an IPA! Overall, better than the average bitter, and one of my favourites from the brewpub. I had this on tap at the brewpub in Denver, Colorado on 12-August-2003.
Wynkoop Churchyard Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Deep brown pour. A bit of light woodiness, but it basically just smells like sweet, wet malt. Flavour has a touch of weird chewy roastiness that I’m not a fan of at all.
Wynkoop Churchyard Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Cask version. Pours a very dark brown with a large bubbled off-white head. Served at cellar temperature. Has a pronounced bourbon flavor and is very malty. The flavor is quickly fleeting and has a very low hop profile. A delicious beer but it deceptively feels like it is bigger in alcohol than it really is.
Wynkoop Churchyard Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at Wynkoop poured a clear reddish brown with a lingering ring of light tan foam. Aromas of carmel, fruittiness and light peat smoke. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of carmel, dried fruit, peat smoke and toffee with a smooth lingering peaty finish.
Wynkoop Churchyard Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Cask - a fairly sweet scotch ale, with a bit of plumy character, some earthy/dms/boiled vegetable character (which is covered by the sweetness fairly well), and a peaty finish, followed by some alcohol warmth - a bit of vanilla, some toasted malt - sweetness washes out a lot of the other characteristics - okay.
Wynkoop Churchyard Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Wynkoop Brewing Company;From the Jug at the GABF, Colorado Convention Center 13/10/2007 Malt aroma. Dark red coloured strong in alcohol and rich on the palate with a slightly dry crisp whisky malt finish.
Wynkoop Churchyard Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. This beer is a dark brown color with a thin and rocky white head that burns away pretty quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel and candied fruit as well as some malt. Flavors of caramel malt and toffee along with some sweet fruit. The finish is smooth and sweet with a caramel malt aftertaste, along with a touch of hops. Overall this is a unique take on the style, and it is a pretty good beer.
Wynkoop Churchyard Ale;Denver, Colorado, United States;Scottish Ale;Wynkoop Brewing Company;Now we are talking. This beer has a bold caramel aroma and flavor. Body is full and rich. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Very nice and balanced beer with lots of flavor.

Augusta Augustiner Maibock;Washington, Missouri, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Augusta Brewing Company;Augustiner Brau München From the Tap. Drinking on May 5th so definitely in season and from the Voss. Quite Malty however prefer over the typical Helle’s as much more flavor.

Munich, Vienna and Caramel malts are what the brewer said was used. Very well balanced, in my opinion, and better than most maibocks in general!
Augusta 1856 IPA;Washington, Missouri, United States;IPA;Augusta Brewing Company;64 oz growler. Pours a hazy amber with a nice foamy white head.

Augusta Tannhauser Pale Ale;Washington, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - English;Augusta Brewing Company;Sample from a growler poured by the brewer.

Morgan Street Golden Pilsner;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Morgan Street Brewery;Draft: Cloudy, dark yellow with a small white head. Grain malt, honey aroma. Slight grassy bitter over sweet grain malt taste... Leans more along the lines of a blonde ale, rather than a Pils... Solidly drinkable, though.

Overall this is a great pilsner. Could use more hops but pilsners aren’t known for that.
Morgan Street Golden Pilsner;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Morgan Street Brewery;Draft... RBSG 2014… Hazy yellow lager with a mid-sized, wispy, white head that diminishes to a small, creamy, white cap. The bouquet is reserved and tough to pull, but I’m picking up rumors of pale malts and spicy hops. Medium-bodied with stinging carbonation.

Morgan Street Cobblestone Steam;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Morgan Street Brewery;"(On tap, named Steam Lager) This beer seems subdued upon first sip, smooth for a second, but quickly the hops kick in and you realize that it is more like an American pale ale than a typical (blander) ""steam beer"". The hops are very fresh and cool tasting, and the malt is fairly complex and blends and balances extremely well with the hops. This is one of the better beers to come out of Morgan street brewing. I wish they made more beers like this because I think this beer is not only well-executed, but unique and has character and complexity. It’s also largely without objectionable qualities, although perhaps it is a bit flat, like most of Morgan street’s brews. I would recommend this one for anyone who likes American pale ales and more bitter beers."

Morgan Street Irish Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;On tap: pours an opaque black with a creamy nitro head. Has a lightly sweet roasty coffee nose with a hint of dark chocolate. Body starts with decent fullness and a bittersweet roasty maltiness with a touch of black licorice and coffee grounds before a drier lingering roasty finish. A pretty true to style and drinkable Irish stout.
Morgan Street Irish Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;Sampler @ the brewpub. A very good dry stout, no flaws. A bit heavier than I like my Dry Stouts but full of roast and some chocolate at the end. Well attenuated, sweetness not coming off the sugars. I would drink this anytime.
Morgan Street Irish Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;Sampled at the 2009 Parkville microbrew festival. Pours black with a beige head. This is a semi-decent beer. For the style it seems a little too sweet but not lactose sweet. I just don’t find the beer to be dry enough. It’s ok though.
Morgan Street Irish Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;[tap at brewery] This beer is delicious, the aroma is roasted coffee and chocolate, the taste has a nice slightly bitter coffee/chocolate dominating that assaults your olfactory as you drink, I love what this beer did while I was drinking it. Simple enough to enjoy, but just complex enough to keep you sipping and pondering.
Morgan Street Irish Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;(On tap) The commercial description of this beer modestly compares it to Guinness, which in my opinion, does not do this beer justice as I think this beer is much better: more flavorful overall and certainly more complex. A little less smooth than is typical for an Irish stout, this beer has a bit of roast, a bit of bitterness, and a rich, coarse texture and a coarse sourness that I like. My main complaints is that, as you drink more of it, it comes across as a bit watery (without being smooth), and a funky quality emerges to the roast, reminiscent of stale coffee. Still, these negative qualities are not particularly dominant, and not nearly as bad as in many microbreweries attempt at a stout, so I have to give them credit for it. Overall, I like this beer and would drink it again, although I think it could be improved somewhat, mainly by making it have a richer body, be smoother, and lose the funkiness in the roast aroma.
Morgan Street Irish Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;Pours a creamy dark brown with a small tan head.

Morgan Street Irish Stout;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Stout - Dry;Morgan Street Brewery;Draught at Morgan St. Pours black with a small, creamy, light brown head, somewhat lasting with good lacing.

Sonnenbräu Ebermannstadt Eber-Weisse;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauerei-Gasthof Sonne (Sonnenbräu);"There are many words in German that use pig or sow (connoting ""extremely"") to denote great taste or greatness of any sort, so maybe that explains the pig on the label? Schweinegut (pig-great), sau-lecker (pig-delicious) are 2 I can think of, but there’s also saumäßig (lousy, or beastly, or rotten). Maybe that’s what they could be hinting at with this picture. Besides the fun picture of a pig drinking a Weissbier on the label, the label on the top states ""Yeasty, Drinkable, Top-Fermenting"" and on the side or (bottom) part I find the best, ""Bottle-fermented,"" which for me says live yeast to possibly harvest for my homebrew. On the back label is a bigger surprise for me. Besides the normal BS about RHG, it states it uses Aroma hops. However, that might just mean ""aroma hops"" were used instead of ""bittering hops"" as the main hop additions. After drinking so many fränkische Biere without a leaf of aroma hops and lots of Noble hop bitterness, it should be nice to get variety. It opened with a bang, yes, it’s bottle fermented, and I had to close the flip top immediately to avoid a minor mess. The beer pours like a regular Weisse, with a light orangish tinge to a nice deep, dark yellow. Foam is huge of course, but dissipated and laid down by the time these last 2 sentences were typed. It’s not see-through clear, but not of a hefe-weizen thickness. It looks like a normal protein haze of some of my homebrews that are a signature of bottle fermentation with some yeast in suspension. It’s not bubbling up CO2 like many Weissbiere, but that may be because I’m drinking it out of a Pils glass. The aroma is wheat full-bore with orange marmelade lemon and a hint of bubblegum, yet no trace of aroma hops :(. The initial tastes is has a hint of sourness, spritzy but not overly so like a Hefeweizen. The wheat is as noticable as the Pils malt is. The taste has very, very light bubblegum but more in the direction of citrus, but not lemon, and finally, more of a sweet aftertaste. Basically, it’s a sweet and sour taste that lingers without any hint of hops. In summer, I can imagine it to be a great thirst quencher of a warm, sunny day. The mouthfeel is not think nor thin, really a happy medium. Overall, I think I would’ve like it better sitting in the shade of tree with a little sweat from a nice warm day. Normally, I wouldn’t expect sourness in a Weissbier but with the Eber-Weisse, it fits in nicely. I would give it a 4 out of 5."

Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;Had at the brewpub on tab and somehow smelled like a skunked beer. Tasted ok but nothing special and hard to concentrate on taste when aroma is like a skunk.
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;"Dark golden foamy head. Clear, lots of light, a bit hazy. Some spidery lace. Flowery malt aroma. Smell is not distinct, not strong. Has a heavy spicy / Saison / maibock flavor. Spicy and a bit sour like a saison; hints of dark grape. Some honey to smooth it out. Some white wine. Feels bubbly; sharp and fizzy. Improves with warmth. Actually a solid brew, much better once you let it breathe a bit."
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;12oz Handbottle. Labeled 6/08. Slightly estery and rubbery nose, backed with some slightly old malt. Pours a crystal clear burnt orange, with a soft soap up in lacey whitish. Flavor is shocking. There’s some really ugly flaming tire, hexane cleaning chemicals, and residue. Rubbery. Bitter. Alcoholic. Ahh. This is, unfortunately, not drinkable. Some bitter almond close the smack, but ugh, this has some serious problems.
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. The stronger alcohol content has a bit of a bite. Good overall flavors with good hops on a solid malt. I found the bitterness a bit more than I cared for.
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;"12oz bottle, courtesy of ryan. Thanks! Pours a bright, clear golden-orange color; light, creamy khaki head with solid, fine-bubbled lacing. Light aroma showing candy sugar, basic cereal malts, and some orange-tinged fruitiness; a bit bland overall, with a touch of alcohol poking through. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: candy sugar, sweet basic maltiness, and some light citrus and mineral bitterness; slightly relaxed carbonation, making this seem a touch flabby overall; still, decent amounts of balancing mineral bitterness and a solid, if not overly complex, malty core. Lengthy, dry finish: toasted malts, breadiness, and some minerals."
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;Draft at new brewpub. Poured clear dark amber color with an average creamy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted nutty malty aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Medium balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Drinkable brew that met my expectations.
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;Tap at Spuyten Duyvil. Pale amber beer with a thick white head. Pale malts with light honeyish character. Acetaldehyde and DMS stink. After the last two quality brews, this nastiness just doesn’t cut it.
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;Draft at Spuyten Duyvil. Vegetal, dry earthy. As it warms there is a kind of glue taste that makes it near undrinkable. Doesn’t have much to separate it from other maibocks, and doesn’t really live up to its brothers, either.
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;A little lighter in color than many mai bocks I've tried in the past. Wonderful malt sweetness ... some citus flavors. More hops than many mai bocks. I really enjoyed the lingering aftertaste. This is the beer to drink while munching peanuts outside on an overcast afternoon. MBC's mai bock is a beautifully balanced beer and could become a favorite.
Michigan Brewing Mai Bock;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Michigan Brewing Company;Nice malty inhale redolent of peaches and cinnamon - deceptively soft, as is the first smooth rich taste. The thing just has more than hops than are usual in a bock and they fire up the close significantly. Good stuff.

Thirsty Dog Balto Heroic Lager;Akron, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Aroma of malt and faint caramel. Nice even, surprisingly full taste of malt, caramel and grass.
Thirsty Dog Balto Heroic Lager;Akron, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;A brew with clear high and low points. Highs? The lovely appearance, with a nice medium copper color and off white head. The aroma, with a nice sweetness and some alcohol notes. Lows? The flavor, sadly. It’s thin and lacks much depth. A bit of malt and caramel sweetness, but it can’t live up to the aroma...not even close, really.
Thirsty Dog Balto Heroic Lager;Akron, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"Retired? Guess it’s a good thing I found a bottle when I did! Aroma is strong, malty and fruity. It pours a clear golden amber with a thick off-white head that does not stick around too long. Flavor does not quite match the aroma, being malty with a hint of fruit and a touch of hops but mostly unremarkable; still, it satisfies. Texture is smooth and tingly, rather typical."
Thirsty Dog Balto Heroic Lager;Akron, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Bottle Pours a hazy amber with an off white head. The head leaves quickly. Lacing is okay. Aroma is malty. Mostly caramel and grass. Has an okay cabonation. The mouthfeel is alright. Theflavor is spicy grass. Which really works for tis beer. Has a good malty endiing. Has a medium body. A thickier texture. The finish is good with a good aftertaste. Not a bad beer from a brewer who makes good beer.
Thirsty Dog Balto Heroic Lager;Akron, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours pretty hazy, light golden color with a very small white head with poor retention. Aroma shows fresh barley, cracker, intensely malty. Very grainy, like barley husks. No hops to be found. Flavor is dry, malty, very low bitterness. Tastes the same as it smelled, crackers and barley. Could use a tad more hops. This is all right, not exactly what I think of when I think of Viennas though.
Thirsty Dog Balto Heroic Lager;Akron, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;POured a light straw yellow color with a white head. Aroma was grassy some caramel and thats about it. Flavor was much the same, really bland, some hints of hop bitterness detected as well.

There is some sediment that comes with the pour. The aroma is light caramel, toasted bread, and a hint of bitterness. The flavor has caramel malt, honey sweetness, a light amount of fruit, and some bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied at best, slightly watery and thin. Not bad, maybe better than I expected.
Thirsty Dog Balto Heroic Lager;Akron, Ohio, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Light haze on this copper brew. Sweet caramel malt, light grass, toasty malts, and some floral as well in the aroma. Full bodied and smooth. Nice toasted malt, caramel, and some earth/floral hops in the flavor.

Thirsty Dog McDoogins Irish Stout;Akron, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Sampled from the beer engine at the brewpub: Poured a surprisingly transparent dark brown with a thin, short-lived, light tan head. Aroma is subtle and malty, but with a noticeable brandy quality. Lightly sweet and filled with brandy oak, it’s body was also kinda thin and not very interesting. Would’ve much rather seen the Siberian Night on the beer engine.
Thirsty Dog McDoogins Irish Stout;Akron, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;"On tap (nitro tap...no!) at the Dayton location. Quite the variety of opinions here on this beer; I am in the ""liked it"" camp. Poured like your average nitro stout, dark chocolate-brown (with red tinges) and a thick, creamy, dense tan head. While this beer is probably offered to the general public as ""Guinness-like,"" I was pleasantly surprised by how un-Guinnessy (dontcha love Ratebeer English?) the flavor was; instead of rather acidic roasts dominating the palate, this beer offered loads of chocolate balanced by toasty notes and a bit of caramel. Aroma was very light at first (and roasty) but some caramely elements appeared as the glass warmed a bit. Nice complexity for a rather thin-bodied beer. Goes down so smooth...and so fast."
Thirsty Dog McDoogins Irish Stout;Akron, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Dark brown color with a small tan head. Roasted aroma and flavor. It is somewhat thin and watery for a stout. Very smooth and drinkable. Thanks to Dogbrick for the growler.
Thirsty Dog McDoogins Irish Stout;Akron, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;and on to the stouts. This was very light for a stout. lighter and less creamy then guiness. Still a very good stout and i'd have again (if they were out of siberian).
Thirsty Dog McDoogins Irish Stout;Akron, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;water + stout = watery stout with no head or taste. Couldn't teach an old dog new tricks in this one.
Thirsty Dog McDoogins Irish Stout;Akron, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;This poor, tired old dog has gone soft and thin. The body was so watery - thinner than a nitro-canned Guinness. It looked so tasty - deep black body, creamy head. Even the roasted malts were affected by the watery taste. It did have enough hops to dry out the finish. This dog may need to be put down.
Thirsty Dog McDoogins Irish Stout;Akron, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Definitely the best offering from Thirsty Dog. I'm glad I tried this one last. Thick and dark, incredibly smooth.
Thirsty Dog McDoogins Irish Stout;Akron, Ohio, United States;Stout - Dry;Thirsty Dog Brewing Company;Rerate 05/05/03:Tried this again from a growler and I am adjusting my rating slightly lower because the thinness was more noticeable this time. However it is still an easy-drinking Stout and I like the roasted coffee flavor very much. I mostly wanted to amend my statement of this being my favorite Thirsty Dog beer. Nothing will ever top Siberian Night now that I have tried that. 05/21/02 (4.3): Unbelievably smooth, yet with a bubbly appearance. Excellent roasted quality to the armoma and flavor. Probably my favorite Thirsty Dog offering.

Goose Eye Pommies Revenge;Bingley, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Eye Brewery;First tasted this at the Waterside Inn, Seamill in August 1995. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear pale straw in colour with a thin white head. Dusty hop flowers in the short aroma. Thin refreshing mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a slight digestive biscuit note with gooseberry, kiwi and lime notes coming through. Hops give a light citric taint to the resiny aftertaste. Finish is lightly edged with dry hops to give a sharp citric bite to accompany the golden syrup laden malty finish. An excellent ESB session beer and well recommended.

Bartrams Red Queen;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;"See Beer Elsie Bub for some general comments on Bartrams beers. I had expected this to be a ""red ale"" from the name, but it was, in fact, a pale copper colour. Malt and hops in the aroma. Malt continues into the flavour, but there is a lot, and I mean a lot, of hoppy bitterness here too. Very bitter finish. Drinks above its abv. Very nice. Bottle-conditioned, October 2003."

Plain aroma, grainy, very light fruitiness, virtually no hop. Hardly any bitterness in the flavor, mostly plain biscuity malts, caramel, and no hop character to be found. Very bland, unimpressive.

McGuires Hefeweizen;Pensacola, Florida, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;McGuires Irish Pub & Brewery;Yet again I have to wonder why mcguires keeps there average offerings on the menu hen they have it within their means to make such quality seasonal brews. The hefeweizen was smoothly cloudy with a white head. Clean but not watery mouthfeel with a fruity and acidic taste. Stronger hoppiiness than most wheats. Great beer all around. Second only to mcguires millinium belgian as far as their offerings go.

Murky body is mostly orange. Clove and bananas dominate the aroma. Dought yeast. Wheaty, strawy malts. Really a great smelling yeast. Nice moderate citric acidity.

McGuires Extra Special Bitter;Pensacola, Florida, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;McGuires Irish Pub & Brewery;I was told this was a pale ale, but apparently from the description on the webpage, this appears to be the ESB. Nice hop selection, seem to be goldings. I didn’t see the recipe on the chalk boards in the brewery section. I thought this could use a little more amber color. Still, this was my favorite of the five I tried tonight.

Very small tan head that mostly diminished, no lacing, no carbonation observed, transparent, and an orange hue. Nose was malty, caramel, hoppy, and crisp. Flavor was sweet, lightly bitter, malty, caramel, hoppy, citrus, and a hint of pine. Mouthfeel was smooth and light in body.

McGuires Extra Special Bitter;Pensacola, Florida, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;McGuires Irish Pub & Brewery;Sampled at Brewgrass Fest. This one had a beautiful creamy tan head and nice lacing (porbably partially due to the serving method...but I still liked it) on a really dark brown body. Aroma was of toasty malts. I had a hard time picking out much hops in the bouquet, but then again I also had a hard time getting upwind of all the damn smokers! I really enjoyed this beer, although for some reason it reminded me more of a scotch ale than an ESB.

Park Tavern Druid Pils;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Park Tavern Brewery;Pours light golden with a fully receding off white head. Aroma is bready, with notes of diacetyl and herbal hoppiness. Taste is bready and yeasty but also hindered by diacetyl and acetaldehyde. Mouthfeel is meidum bodied with moderate carbonation. Easily drinkable, but this needs a more full boil and an extended diacetyl rest!
Park Tavern Park Trail Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Park Tavern Brewery;Pours a slightly odd goldish hue with a small head but an excellent carbonation, still bubbling as the glass empties. Carbonation complements an excellent malt mouthfeel, though there is a odd note to the aroma that detracts from the experience of the sip. The taste is a great balance of malt and hops, a much more true example of an American pale ale than many in the over-IPAed craft beer moment of today. While not an excellent beer, it is superb for a house brewed ale at a local restaurant.
Park Tavern Park Trail Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Park Tavern Brewery;Pint at the brewpub. This is a deep gold hue with a small white head.

Park Tavern Park Trail Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Park Tavern Brewery;I made three visits to the tavern this month and each time have had the pale ale and it has been right on the money. True to style, with a very similar feel to what you can get in british pubs, albeit not cask. But the mouthfeel and carbonation is right, contrary to most US ales. In the past I have been disappointed with their ales but something has definitely improved here. I know they are brewing these cause I can smell it sometimes!
Park Tavern Park Trail Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Park Tavern Brewery;Comes out of the tap a clear golden amber - not remarkable, but at least appetizing. Malty aroma has some fruity and spicy hints. Solid flavor is mainly malty and surprisingly hoppy, and only mildly bitter. Texture is smooth, tingly, and satisfyingly sassy. Nothing spectacular, but worthy.
Park Tavern Park Trail Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Park Tavern Brewery;Hazy dark blonde. The aroma is fruity with some brett. There’s a definite infection, but mostly it’s brett, maybe a little pedio. At this point, it’s at a nice, happy level. A week later and this will probably be terrible. But at this particular moment, the infection is going well with the fruity hop character.
Park Tavern Park Trail Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Park Tavern Brewery;Hazy peach-orange color with small off-white head. Smells like Brett, and the bacteria blends well with the hops even though it is unintentional. Medium-high carbonation is prickly. Dry, thin finish. The hops almost come across as being those in a Belgian IPA because of the nuance added by the bacteria. An accidentally good brew.
Park Tavern Olmsted Amber;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Park Tavern Brewery;On tap. It poured a golden color with a white head. The aroma was of malts, caramel, toast and hops. It tasted similar to the aroma with more malts, caramel, toast, hops with a nice aftertaste. Not bad.

Park Tavern Olmsted Amber;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Park Tavern Brewery;Nothing special but definitely can enjoy sitting and sipping this amber, highlighted by a subdued sweet malt flavor complemented by hops.
Park Tavern Olmsted Amber;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Park Tavern Brewery;Pint at the brewpub. Clear amber with a tiny head. This one smells sweet, lots of caramel and toffee hints. It’s a medium bodied ale with bunches of sticky malt flavor and a butterscotch finish. Hops are very mild. One glass is more than enough.
Park Tavern Olmsted Amber;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Park Tavern Brewery;Only got this because the pale ale was bad and the ipa hasnt been on for months. Amber? It was really dark and I would have guessed it was a brown ale only I have had their brown ale and this isnt it. It was flat, and the taste was predominantly licorice. It only cost a dollar because it rained that day. Overpriced.

Aroma of lightly sweet earthy malt with a touch of dark chocolate. Body starts fairly sweet and caramely malty with a touch of black cherries before a toasty dark malty finish. A nice porter.
Park Tavern Piedmont Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Park Tavern Brewery;Pours black with a mostly receding tan head. Aroma of roast malt: predominantly chocolate but ventures towards coffee and spice. Taste is lightly sweet, with notes of chocolate and crystal malt. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with moderate. Enjoyable, the best beer I had at my recent visit.
Park Tavern Piedmont Porter;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Porter;Park Tavern Brewery;This dark brown beer seems to be struggling a bit. It’s thin in flavor, but sugary. It may have some quality control issues much like the beers at Park Tavern the last time I visited.

Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;Don’t quite remember this one but it was tasty & easy on the palate. Good stuff!
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;On draft at Max Lagers in downtown Atlanta. Pours light brownish red with no head. Aroma of some Belgian funk and something I don’t recognize. Flavor is a bit weird, with some cough syrup flavors, maybe some spice, and a little bit of yeast. Lighter bodied with plus carbonation. This was the only real miss for me on my visit.
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;growler. clear copper with no head. malty, brown sugar, caramel, coins aroma. caramel, fruity esters, banana, belgian yeast flavors. mild to moderate sweetness, sort-of dry finish, medium body. lightly warming.
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;"On tap at the brewpub. Handsome pour, gleaming deep brown with moderate carbonation and nice sticky lacing. It’s a pretty game effort at a dubbel. Soft and inviting nose. Not exactly obvious that there’s Trappist yeast involved, but the aroma is still a nice blend of nutty malts, caramel, and esters. Body is a bit on the thin side, slightly slick in the finish. But it tastes nice, on point even if not ""wow."""
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;Beautiful brownish, amber pour, thin head. Moderate dark fruit aroma. Flavors were similar, dark fruits, candied sugar, some cloves and the obvious yeastiness. The big knock was that it was undercarbonated, to put it kindly (it was flat). Still, not bad and avoids the pitfalls of many american attempts (candied sugar bombs). Worth trying.
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;Tap. Amber color, white head. Aroma of buttered popcorn. .. Not a Good sign. Flavor is very sweet. Finishes with a lot of cinnamon, for a beer. It has an old (A.B.C.) Big Red not to it. Medium bodied.
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;Lightly hazy amber, decent head. Aroma was caramel and clove accented Belgian yeast. Flavor essentially matched. A bit off from a true dubbel, but not a bad belgianish beer.
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;Red-orange, off white head. Aroma is sweet, sugar, little else. Taste is sweet candy sugar, fruity esters, light clove, alcohol.
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;Appearance: Clear, amber-golden body with a thin, short-lived, white head. Already, the widespread carbonation problem, which has plagued the other pints I’ve tried, seems to be present here, too. What gives?! Smell: Spicy and sweet on the nose with a notable bready character and fruity notes of golden raisins and semi-ripened apricots. Taste: Bready, lightly toasty maltiness lightly brushed with sweet caramel. Moderate amount of sweetness throughout. Background hint of finely-ground spices. Light fruitiness splashed with honey liqueur. Max Abbey has a warming finish that’s a tad on the sweet side. Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Lightly carbonated. Touch of stickiness to the mouthfeel, no doubt facilitated by the sheer lack of effervescence. Drinkability: A decent abbey ale, but, like Max Lager’s other beers, seems to be hampered by a surprising lack of carbonation. Which, don’t get me wrong, I’m not a proponent of highly carbonated beers with all their ghastly tongue-prickling fizziness, but that doesn’t mean flat is the way to go.
Max Abbey;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Dubbel;Max Lager's;Color is a beautiful dark honey-golden, cloudy and opaque, with a decent white head. Aroma is strong, malty, with fruity undertones. Flavor is rich, mainly malty with a touch of apple, and just a whisper of hoppy bitterness. Velvety smooth and mouth-filling, this is a beer to sip and appreciate.

Oberdorfer Weihnachtsbier;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);My username reflects my undying devotion to this most interesting creation. Like a beautiful woman hiding behind cats eye glasses. The glasses (appearance)are interesting but are masking the real beauty. The light haze draws you into a complex palate that starts smooth and slightly sweet but finishes pleasantly dry and clean. Its true beauty is the sum of it parts. Enjoy. My regret is that access is limited.
Oberdorfer Weihnachtsbier;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Nice light color good aroma. Somewhat metallic tasting. Not terribly good lasting flavor. Finishes a bit sharp. Disappointing.
Oberdorfer Weihnachtsbier;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Allgäuer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Interesting surprise packgage from Davhgbrew and I had no idea what to expect. Looks like a Krystall or Kolsch, smells like a Bock, finishes like a Pilsner. Light straw color, slight wheat haze, weak head. Fruity malt aroma, a little winey. A little fizz on the palate, but pretty smooth verging on syrupy. Sweet full maltiness, (agree with honey below) but crispens a little mid-palate, finishing with a nice dryness. Works well as the sweeter front does linger through striking a fine balance with the the drier finish. Still not sure of the style but not a bad brew.

Town Hall Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Tap at the brewery. Garnet color with beige head. Not as dark as I would expect a porter to be. Sweet maltiness with barely any roast flavor. Would be better labeled as a brown ale than a porter.

Town Hall Porter;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler: pours a steady brown to settle nearly black and stays black. A very tawny deep chestnut can be detected up to a strong light. Capping is medium in stature with a nice sandy brown evenly foamed froth. Eventually slips away to a ghostly skim and a thin collar. Some spotty lace with a few tiny strands are flung about and sticking to the glass. Aroma is light and sweet with a fair amount of cocoa and a smidgeon of roasted malt and a tiny note of grain husk dryness. Flavors are mild and set in tone with a moderate base of easy going, smooth cocoa sweetness. Touches a bit of roasted malt and a sliver of coffee noting the finish as it flecks at the hint of char and burnt toast even later. Light to medium body, smooth and fairly slick with a budge just past the middle area bringing in a brief build up on the palate as it tenderizes the flavors a bit and floats off the finish with a ever so faint and lovely cocoa dryness. A pretty decent porter. A subtle delight of a beer. Perhaps not a stand out in impactful punch in flavor as some of the other mighty brews that have graced the taps of Town Hall. But if you don’t mind a simple, subtle little sit down porter. This will suit you just fine.

Mild sweet malt in the aroma. Light honeymalt flavor with a medium floral hop finish. Mellow, light body, smooth drinking, and very softly carbonated.
Great Waters Martins Bitter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Semi-translucent and lovely nectary orange in color with a grey glacial sheaf topping it off. Aroma is well derived from chestnuts, mild marmalade mixed with light molasses and brown sugar, ginger chews rolled in amber rock candi, and a rustic, edible dust at the cuffs. Delicate flavor pulls with a spruce accented bitterness, transitioning to an orange toffee crème body. Supple carbonation gives a mild life to the light cocoa, hazelnut and caramel-like concoction. Moderate orange candied grahams make for a medium-bodied simplicity, but it’s fairly well done. Caramelized willow wheat plucked from the fields is met with a mild English hop bitterness for a charmingly clean finish.
Great Waters Martins Bitter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Great Waters Brewing;Terribly bland, timid and BORING. No head, no bitterness, no substantial mouthfeel that I can remember and again, that watered down texture. But I did taste that strong floral hoppiness that I find in almost everyone of their beers.
Great Waters Martins Bitter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Great Waters Brewing;Clear copper. Fruity, citric nose, no real hops. Flavor is a bit woody and nutty, some lemon. Toasty at the end. Could use some more depth.

Great Waters Saint Peter Pale Ale;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Waters Brewing;"Draft at the brewpub. Standard visuals for an EPA, perhaps a bit darker than some.

The St Paul brewery is downtown near the St Paul Hotel. This APA was one of the best tasted for the trip. The clear amber color and frothy head were impressive. The bitter floral flavors of the hops were well balanced with the malts. The finish was smooth with some bitterness. The APA had an IBU of 50 and 14 Plato and served at 38 degrees. We also had Bac-n-Beer nuts that was spicy.

Great Waters Anniversary Amber;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Claims to be brewed with six different kinds of hops, one for each year they've been open, hence the 6th Anniversary Amber. Color is light brownish amber, kinda hazy, very little head, about 1/8 of an inch that faded fast and left some lace. Faint spicy hop and malt aroma, very soft and light on the nose. Taste is good, a little empty at the start, but the middle gets some malt tones and finishes with very nice sweet, bitter hop bite, slightly dry. Has a bit of spicyness. Is light to medium bodied and resembles an IPA style in the overall taste. They serve it a little to cold. But it mellows out as it sits. Pretty decent stuff. Next years Anniversary is to have another kind of hop added. That should make it even more interesting I'm sure.
Great Waters Anniversary Amber;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Not bad. Hints of nutmeg, sweetness, candy. Somewhat complex. Nice!......
Great Waters McHughs Irish Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Waters Brewing;Black Coloring with Tan Bubbly Head. Coffee Aroma.. Light Rich Malt, Light Coffee Roasts.. Hints of Chocolate. Think Mouthfeel and Overall Subtle Flavor. Session Stout to be Sure.
Great Waters McHughs Irish Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Waters Brewing;Aroma is better than the GW Pothole porter I had before it. Dignified, subtle roasted malt aroma. Tiny bubble, tan head. Black opaque body. Decent lace. Missing sweetness. Some flaws. Lactose. After a lackluster Pothole Porter, and then this beer, I have pretty much lost faith in this brewer.
Great Waters McHughs Irish Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Waters Brewing;Black color with a thin, almost cask-head head. Smells and tastes like coffee. Pretty thin body. Borderline average.
Great Waters McHughs Irish Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Waters Brewing;Push beer sampled on 2/13/2004 at Great Waters. The aroma was roasty. Appearance was dark and rich with a tan head and good lace. The flavor was nice as a Dry Stout, roasty and dry with a decent body. It was served way too cold. However, this was the best of the three beers that night.
Great Waters McHughs Irish Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Waters Brewing;"On cask: Color is awesome with the huge cascade of dull yellow making its way up the sides of the glass, finally settling to a very, very dark brown, nearly black with ruby red highlights around the edges, head is creamy and frothy tight about a finger high, creamy/tan in color and leaves large sheets of lace. Aroma is mild roastyness and milk chocolate with a slight tang of bitterness from hops in the back. Taste is more of the same with a solid dose of mild but bittering milk-like chocolate with a sweet roasty nut-like note darting in late in the finish with a touch of burnt coffee as well. Feel could be smoother, its a bit textured in a uneven sense, but the serving on cask makes for a nice milding effect. The dryness is nice and mild as well, very calming and easy with a nice light cottony feel fading into the mouth making you want another sip; if this was cold it would probably be disturbingly astringent and unpleasant alot like some of the other brews offered here. The cask does help it out alot I think. Even with that said, it has pretty good drinkability. Reminded me alot of the Pot Hole Porter with a bit of a different finish."
Great Waters McHughs Irish Stout;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Dry;Great Waters Brewing;Not much aroma. Rough, extremely dry finish. Didn't seem malted enough. But to their credit, the owner was talking to me and he told me that the particular batch wasn't quite up to par. (He said that before I drank it :)

Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;Mahogany with a cap of nice fine bubbles. This actually smells like an oatmeal stout. Toasty, buttery, warm brown sugar. Nice soft palate, but kind of clumsy chocolate flavor and a bit of stale smoke. Not bad, but also not stellar.
Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;On cask, served at 52°F in an 8oz serving. Rich, chocolate and nutty, roasted coffee aroma with a hint of roasted oats. Dark, dark brown with ruby tints and a thick, off-white head filled with tiny little bubbles. Sweet chocolate with roasted barley and what I refer to as toasted sesame seeds in the flavor. Medium-light bodied, very soft carbination with a slightly dry finish. Reminds me of a lighter, sweet stout because of the roasted notes I taste.
Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;Very thin bodied, especially for a porter, with a distinctly watered down feeling. Weird floral aftertaste that I don’t expect in the style. Not very satisfying.
Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;Very dark, faint hint of red, absolutely no head. Nose has toffee, and something akin to bourbon, but it’s light in the smelling department. Molasses bitter, not any coffee or chocolate, just basically tastes like watered-down molasses. Watery, and not because of the cask, just not a good mouthfeel.
Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Very faint aroma, but somehow pleasant. Hint of sweet roasted malt. Cascading opaque body as one would expect from a cask Porter. Average sized tan head. I really didn’t like the color of the head. It wasn’t quite tan, and it wasn’t quite a smooth creamy off-white like in a Guinness. It was dirty looking. Some lace. Not bad, not great. I warmed up to it a little bit at mid glass. Some sweetness.
Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;In the cask at the Brewpub. Very black with a brown head. In fact, a phenomenal head. This was a good-looking beer. I could not get much of an aroma out of this one. Surprising taste like chocolate mint. Smooth going down, but a sour aftertaste. Slightly disapointing for a cask-conditioned ale.
Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;Guinness wannabe mugshot. Fearless head standing tall throughout all opposition. No aroma, but body is creamy without overburdening or stickiness. Finish is tannic, oaky, and creamy.
Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;Appearance: deep, dark brown, with a fuzzy, light tan head. Aroma: smooth, mellow, creamy, with nutty hints. Taste: mild and mellow, medium bodied, with a sweetness in the finish. Missing a lot of flavors I yearn for in a good porter, actually, not much in the coffee’n’cocoa department, lacks a fullness I prefer. Drinks down nice enough, but in my book, just passable as a porter. Afterthought: I look at the notes from my St. Paul comrades and clearly we tasted different beers, for they tasted the things I missed. Perhaps I owe it to Great Waters to try this again, next time. After-after-thought: I’m all for alliteration, but why did they name it after something you like to avoid, that’s what I wonder...
Great Waters Pot Hole Porter;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Great Waters Brewing;Cask sample. Very dark brown, with a bit of gold at the edge. Chocolate-caramel nose, hints of vanilla. Smooth, vinous, moderately sweet body with a bit of robustness to finish, but far too watery in the mouth.
Great Waters Bourbon Barrel Brown;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Dark Red/Brown with Light Tan Head. Light Dusty Malt Aroma. Very Light Bourbon Notes. Very Subtle Tasting Brew and Easy to Drink. Very Subtle Notes that it was in fact Aged in a Bourbon Barrell. Overall a Solidly Average Brew, if you Accept the Extreme Low-Key Atmosphere of this Beer.
Great Waters Bourbon Barrel Brown;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Great Waters Brewing;In the cask at the Brewpub. Dark amber-brown in color with a beige head. This beer was kind of a disappointment. There’s not much here. It’s very smooth and easy to drink. Very good malt content. If this was ever in a bourbon barrel, it has no evidence of it.
Great Waters Bourbon Barrel Brown;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Dark copper. Sweek malt aroma. Single brown-ale-colored flavor. Light caramel notes. Empty finish. Not fantastic, but a reasonably pleasant session beer.
Great Waters Bourbon Barrel Brown;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Rich head, clinging to the glass above a chestnut brown beer. Light bourbon touch, moderate nutty and woody. Very thin (typical brown ale) at cask temperature, smooth, and dangerously easy drinking. Such an easy finish, too bad it is only a brown ale to start with before going into the barrels. Excellent. (cask conditioned, handpull, at brewpub)
Great Waters Bourbon Barrel Brown;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Tap @ brewpub. A dark brown color with a creamy brown head. A musty aroma. Smooth malty flavors with a slight hint of the bourbon barrel. A pleasant sweetness and a touch of fruit. A great brown ale.
Great Waters Bourbon Barrel Brown;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Cask. Very lovely dark brown color (reminded me of a nice oak table) with a thick head. Kind of a dead aroma, but slight malts are there. Taste is a tasty mix of toasty malts and raw barley, but none of the heavy hitting nuts that I would expect from a Brown Ale. The bourbon is slightly detectable as an alcoholic zing at the front, but doesn’t appear too much in the beer. The cask definitely rounds out the body and makes it insanely smooth. A very tasty brew, but not as stellar as I was looking for.
Great Waters Bourbon Barrel Brown;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Great Waters Brewing;"""Cask""ading action is short lived but impressive gold tones flurry then settling to a nice dark amber walnut color with a steady finger high head of ivory creamyness, continent shaped lacing sticks well. Smell is faint sweetness of fruit, peach and lightly lemony. Unique soft taste of sweet bourbon, an interesting mix of tenderness and rigid ripeness, malts and fruits dance lightly together with a twinge of bitterness, sour-like grapefruit notes. It goes right through and down as far as feel, lightly astringent and velvety textured, smokey and limpid. A wee bit lighter then I was expecting, has a sour drying of lemonyness into the finish thats nice. Worth a try, quite interesting, on cask makes it worth while."
Great Waters Bourbon Barrel Brown;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Great Waters Brewing;Nice dark appearance, pretty head. Whiskey hints in the nose, and I thought that I was in for a treat (a la Happy Jack Stout from The Bitter End in Austin, TX). However, the bourbon didn't follow through in the taste and I was a bit disappointed.
Sapporo Kiritto Special Brew;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Another addition to the already overcrowded macro lager market in Japan. Has one distinguishing feature, a bit of a spicy aftertaste. I wonder what hops they use?
Sapporo Kiritto Special Brew;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Tastes much like any other American Standard lager. Unlike most Japanese beers, this one's not particularly dry. I like the cobalt blue metallic can, however, it imparts a hint of metallic taste to the beer.
Sapporo Kiritto Special Brew;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sapporo Breweries;Crisp, refreshing. Slightly sweet. Hoppy. A good beer.......................

Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sly Fox Brewing Company;this is a pretty good examples of style, has some fragrance, nice clean hops. but of course a little thin. no head or lacing
Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sly Fox Brewing Company;The most interesting thing about this beer is the can. The rest is really a standard Helles lager. Certainly drinkable, not really bitter, okay flavor.
Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Lemon and a little funk in the aroma, a little off. Standard (and good) flavor, with lots of cereal-like pilsner malt and more grassy hops than usual. Pretty good.
Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Can. I'm getting pretty noticeable lemon notes in this. They differentiate it from other helles lagers, but don't really fit. Beyond that, bready malt backbone and crisp hop bite.
Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Nice golden color. Clean malty flavor. Nice noble hop flavor and aroma. Great summer beer, especially on hot days. ---Rated via Beer Buddy
Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Blind tasted with 4 other helles/dortmunder lagers. Lagers were: 1. Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager 2. Lakefront My Turn #023 Dylan 3. Benediktiner Original / Hell 4. Schloßbrauerei Fattigau Schloß-Export 5. Key Helles. Both raters rated the beers 21534. 355ml can. Gold pour. Fruity aroma, mixed popsicle aroma. Falvor is grainy and hoppy, fresh, refreshing, bit bittersweet. Post tasting thoughts: This delivered but was a bit odd in a few ways.
Sly Fox Helles Golden Lager;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Drank this on a hot day after doing yard work so this got a higher rating than I probably would’ve given it. Aroma was weak. Lager smells with a hint of boiled egg. Pour was a light clear gold with no head. Taste was offensive at first but then as I got hotter it tasted better. Fresh baked bread and crust were the main flavors but there was little carbonation to help them. The sulfur hurt and there was a wet doughy finish. Im not a huge fan of the style to begin with, but this is one of the rare German styles that I think Americans just haven’t figured out yet

Sly Fox Renard DOr;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;On tap at the bocktown. Taste is alittle mild for a strong ale but a medical buikds thru the session. Fairly flat, I don’t detect any co2 at all. Not sure what to think of this bitter medicine. Needs some manners, even for a strong ale. I must say tho, it does try to fool you on the initial taste, comes across rather friendly then bites you inthe ass.
Sly Fox Renard DOr;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Sly Fox Brewing Company;transparent gold, lacing white head. Dusty yeast and citrus nose becomes heavy bubblegum, ethanol, and peppery yeast finish in flavor. Soft carbonation leaves it oppressive.

Sly Fox Royal Weisse;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sly Fox Brewing Company;5/7/2016 -- from notes: Sample on tap at Whiskey Village during CBC. Orange juice appearance. Bready wheat malt, kind of peppery and spicy. Hint of citrus. Medium body. Light dry, lighter, crisp carbonation. Mild dry finish. Light sour. Moderate sweet. OK berliner. Not interesting nor particularly flavorful, but refreshing enough. If you told a layman that this was OJ they'd probably think it was too watered-down.

Nose is wheat, dough, tangerine, very light banana. The palate is bread and lemon rind. After a few minutes, the banana and clove notes of the traditional weisse show up, though fairly subdued. It’s uncomplicated but refreshing. Sometimes on a warm day, you just want a cold one. This is for those times.

Dübels Brücker;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Bavaria-St.Pauli-Brauerei (Carlsberg);(Bottle 50 cl) Apparently brewed from the devils own recipe... Nothing diabolic about it though. The malt provides a pretty, reddish brown colour. Flavour is dominated by the roasted malt. But mainly dry and bitter with a weak, underlying sweetness. Full-bodied and quite nice. 300600

Dübels Brücker;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Bavaria-St.Pauli-Brauerei (Carlsberg);Bitter and very dry. Aromas of musty hops. Alcoholic aroma even though it's only 4.9% and not very dark -- a medium brown. I've got good creamy foam. Not a whole lot there. It's brewed with hop extract -- no hops.
Dübels Brücker;Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Bavaria-St.Pauli-Brauerei (Carlsberg);A relatively strong aroma, but a little foul somehow. Dusty too. The color is clear carmel. A mild, sweet taste predominates. Slightly bitter and woody finish. Very thin body - too thin. Large bubbles and no head. Enjoyable, but this is a cheap beer posing a something special. Just above average.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;WOW. Can’t believe I never got around to rating this. Thanks again to Skyhand. Bottled in 1995. Drank around 2007ish. An absolutely brilliant perfection once again from Alan. The man really can do no wrong. Big and fairly boozey but it only compliments the raisin, toffee, candy, and bits of awesome burnt cocoa. SO GOOD.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Nice dark pour with no real head. Flavor is aweome. Sean9689 mentioned that this was the best bottle he had ever tried, and it was really good. Sweet, tobacco, port, leather, hints of dark fruit.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Served in a Hair of the Dog stemmed taster. Nose is similar to Dave but without being as heavy on the smoke. Blackberry jam, booze, tobacco, and mild spice notes. Bit of booze.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Thanks to Richard for the share. Paired with Hair of the Dog Dave. The beer appears virtually still and is dark brown in color. The aroma brings molasses, a touch of soy sauce, though certainly not off putting. Additional notes of leather, maple. The flavor brings more spice than the aroma indicated. A bit of pepper with moderate booze. Void of carbonation and really smooth in the palate. A once in a lifetime experience and certainly an enjoyable experience pairing this with Dave.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Sampled at the CCB/RateBeer/Pre-Hunah Tasting (Tampa, FL).

Chocolate, some roast, mellow growing earthy hop bitterness. Initial is roasty, dry and bitter, some pretzel, cocoa, and more toast and roast as we press on. Toasty, dry. Middle is cocoa, dark black malts, and toffee. Still firmly dry, roasty, and cocoa. nice bigger flavors, backend is dry, toasty, rich coffee and dry bakers chocolate. Finish is dry, a bit bitter and cocoa laden, shavings, gentle dark fruit. Solid fun beer.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours dark brown with a small brown head.

Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Forgot I had this with Jeremy and Chris. Still plum body. Soft cardboard elements hint at severity of oxidation, behind which hides some chocolate, soy, and a bit of paper. Thin oily body, short bitter finish. Drank against ten vintages of Adam ranging 1-8 years of age, and none of complexity of those remains in Eve. Feel bad ticking such an old beer this low, especially when Adam is consistently 4.4+. This rating is intended as a cold bucket of water for all the Captain Ahabs out there still hoping the hunt is worthwhile.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Pour is a clear dark wine like red with no head. The nose is different, some sweet notes of berry, lightly oxidized, notes of chocolate, strange soy sauce. The taste is rough, salty, chocolate, boozy, vanilla, and a large amount of soy sauce. The Adam characteristics may be there, the body is lightly creamy with low carbonation if any.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Dark mahogany, mostly clear and a slight impression of lacing at certain moments. Nose is umami, soy sauce, old malt, rasins, seaweed. Ocean-like. Mouth is weirdly blank at first, then a pretty heavy seaweed, prune, raisin. Mostly still in the mouth, slick, oily feel. Interesting beer, probably past its prime.
Hair of the Dog Eve;Portland, Oregon, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Hair of the Dog Brewing Company;Bottle shared by Ryan at the Philly tasting. Roasty caramel nose. Clear dark brown pour with no head. Lots of caramel, dark fruits, and a hint of sherry. Medium in body with nice balance.

Hansa Lettøl;Bergen, Norway;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;Blehh alkaline chalky cream-fizzy nothingness. Solely a box-checking exercise with some pointless carbonation. Not enjoyable, i imagine it's consumed only in large quantities by Norwegians that live far from a Vinmonopolet outlet (16.9 oz can, Kiwi supermarket, Oslo)

Hansa Lettøl;Bergen, Norway;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Hansa Borg Bryggerier;As with most other light lagers, this beer has a fantastic appearance in the glass, light yellow golden, thick foamy head. Looks far more refreshing than it really is. Not much aroma, even less taste, just a short sting from the carbonation and/or bittering hops. If you’re really very thirsty, go for it if it’s cold. If you want a glass of delicious beer to enjoy, leave it where it is.

Rebellion IPA;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Just bought a large bottle of this from the brewery's shop. First impressions: it's a traditional bitter, with excellent, subtle, flowery aromas that develop. I can understand why some may consider this a bit watery, but the fact is, it has it all. Starts off with a hint of fresh hoppiness, vaguely cannabis-like, which immediately rounds out to a light toffee/malt aroma, without a tarry lingering aftertaste. There are no roasted-malt notes punching through. Seems very refreshing and tempting to quaff, with absolutely nothing unpleasant about it at all. As an infrequent but keen drinker of bitters, I find this very much to my taste. Exactly what I hoped it would be.

Valhalla Maibock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;Oddly curious and refreshing aroma, suggestive of suntan lotion and mosquito repellant.

Barrel House Belgian Red;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Barrel House Brewing Company;On draught at 69 Taps in Akron. Hazy reddish amber color with a thick and foamy beige head. Thin and sticky lacing. The aroma is both sweet and tart, with malt and sour fruit. Medium-bodied and pretty smooth, with far less sourness than expected for the style. The flavor leans more toward a straight up Amber Ale. Sweet malt and caramel flavors with light sour fruit undertones. There is also a nip of hops here and there. The finish is fruity, tart and short. I am not convinced that a Flemish Sour is the style they were going for. On its own merits the beer is pretty tasty though.
Barrel House Belgian Red;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Barrel House Brewing Company;"Hey, I gotta give Barrelhouse points for attempting to brew a Belgian Style Red Ale, but they missed the mark here. The Barrelhouse brew is too light, without the richness and ""wine-ness"" that one expects from the Flemish brews... it's still very drinkable, though."
Barrel House Belgian Red;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Barrel House Brewing Company;it's tough to say how I really felt about this beer. I was thrilled that anyone would attempt a flanders red ale in a beer starved town like Cincinnati. The beer was indeed a red color altough more amber than red. The aroma was a soft malty aroma. The biggest knock on the flavor was the lack of sourness and bite. It had a slight vinious character that reminded me of fresh grape skins and maybe even a bit of the bubblegum flavor I found in the hefe they have. I think this is a beer that would be great to lay down for awhile a let mature. It just seemed to young.

Pelgrim Lentebock;Rotterdam-Delftshaven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Pelgrim;Huge lasting yellowy head tops the cloudy light copper hue. Very malty, almost with a wheaty hint underneath. It is an kinda earthy rendition where sandy and gentle leafy bitterness never quite cuts through the cerealic and grainy sweetness. A bit simple as far as its toasty or caramelly subtleties go. More fruitiness would also give it a sense of purpose. A it is, a sweet, honeyed and fizzy bock.
Pelgrim Lentebock;Rotterdam-Delftshaven, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij De Pelgrim;On tap@Pelgrim. Cheesy aroma at first, later on a hint of smoke and caramel. Hazy, orange color, citric, several spices, caramel malts. Sticky and full.

White Winter Traditional Brackett;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;White Winter Winery;I didn’t really get the honey aspect of this, but if someone had raved about this as a great dopplebock, I would agree with them. Pours a deep clear red-brown, with a little bit of sediment and an ongoing effervescence. A large, rocky tan head deposits ring after ring of lace. Aroma is decidedly vinous, with port-wine elements. Cider and caramel also present. Flavor is rich and malty, raisins dominate. Gets spicy and slightly fusel in the middle, but here that’s somehow not a flaw. Cloves, citrus zest detectable. Finishes somewhat dry. Medium bodied, very lively mouthfeel.

White Winter Traditional Brackett;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;White Winter Winery;The first beverage sampled at the RBSG ’07 Grand Tasting. From 12-oz bottle, pours a clear burnt amber colro beverage with no head or lacing. Aroma of dry wood, caramel malt and some dark cherries. Taste is light carbonated, dry with a slight sour aftertaste. Not much honey in flavor or scent.
White Winter Traditional Brackett;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;White Winter Winery;RBSG 06. This was a mead I was looking forward too. Unfortunately it was bad. Dry and chalky. No honey or other sweetness at all. Orange color. it was still, like a mead should be.
White Winter Traditional Brackett;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;White Winter Winery;Sampled at the RBSG 07 Grand Tasting. This is my first Brackett and I can’t say it’s my favorite mead style. Honey and malt in the aroma but and the malt flavor, while not overpowering, did seem to dominate the honey.
White Winter Traditional Brackett;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;White Winter Winery;"Approximately 1.5 oz. sample at the Grand Tasting of the RateBeer Summer Gathering 2007 in the Twin Cities, MN on July 23, 2007. This was the third of 26 ""beers"" that I sampled and rated during the tasting. I’m about to confess something that is going to make me look pretty stupid: I did not know this was a mead when I tried this. I just thought it was a honey-flavored beer. Please take that into account when you read the review. If I had any clue I was drinking a mead, I might well have reacted differently to it. It’s funny that, as far as I know, this was my first mead ever, and I didn’t even know it. Anyway... Honey dominates the aroma. One dimensional, but nice. Pours a clear, gold-tinted amber/bronze with a small amount of near white head. Surprisingly bitter base. Tastes almost like a honey-flavored pale ale. If I didn’t know better, and I didn’t at the time I tried it, I would have called it hoppy. Too sweet for me. Odd, almost sour finish. Light to medium body. Smooth and frothy in the palate."
Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Dorada, tirando a ambar, de muy abundante espuma.

Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From Jun 2007 Purchased at Poplar Wine & Spirits in Casper This pours from 12oz bottle(best by 09082007) a clear light gold with a very large billowy head of foam that finally settles down after a few minutes to a fine broken layer with good lacing. The smell is pretty nice. I'm getting notes of spice and a good mix of malt and bitter hops. The taste has some biscuit malt up front and some grassy hop bitterness about midway through. The finish ends on a bitter and then slightly sour note. Interesting. It's pretty flavourful(I'm drinking it at room temp) but I don't think I could call this a session brew for me despite it's low abv. One bottle and I'm done with it for now. Bottom line: Interesting example of the style and is worth a try.
Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);On tap at Portland Brewing, pours a clear pale blonde with a small white head. Aroma brings out crisp crackery malt, not much else really. Flavour is along the same lines, with cereal malts and crackery malt. Light sweetness in there. Pleasant but not interesting. It’s fine.
Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle in Seattle. Pale straw gold, creamy head. Malty sweet body, creamy grain. Mild sweet hop note but muted in front of creamy, touch lactic malt. Solid but not for me.
Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Typical blonde ale here.

Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Served on tap in a pint glass Appearance – The beer is served a golden orange color with a one finger head of white foam. The head of the brew has a good level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a decent level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the beer is heaviest of a bready and light caramel smell with a moderate showing of citrus and a little bit of a yeast. Along with these aromas comes some light hop smells of a floral and citrus nature. Taste – The taste begins with a rather clean malt flavor, being mainly of a doughty and caramel nature. With these flavors comes some other lighter fruit tastes of a peach and citrus nature, which grow slightly stronger as the taste moves on further. All the while the doughty takes on hints of a grainy nature with some hop flavors of a floral and citrus nature. A little bit of a yeast and a light loss of some of the sweet comes at the very end of the taste, leaving one with a rather easy going, but enjoyable flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the average to slightly thinner side for a kolsch with a carbonation level that is rather average. The feel is rather nice for the mix of flavors and makes for a rather enjoyable brew overall. Overall- This was a very easy drinking and quite enjoyable brew overall. Nothing super out of the world, but a nice easy drinker that is great for the summer months.

Pyramid Curve Ball Blonde Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"the first one i had was good enough, but in subsequent tastings, there was an unpleasant, almost skunky quality to it. i’d have thought i got a bad one if it only happened once...and it didn’t taste quite spoiled. just boring and not very good."""
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;had this beer at Shileds tavern in anice colonial glass. It was a fair ale though nothing special but the atmosphere made it great
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;To look on the bright side of things, I’m 4 beers into my mixed sixer of Williamsburg. Only 2 more to go until I can move on to something else. The Stock Ale wasn’t bad, but was a pretty mediocre beer...a tad on the bitter side. I’ll say this, it poured beautifully with a really nice head that lasted the entire glass. The flavor was very average, though.
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with jasonp, thanks Jason!) This bottle has aged in my cellar for awhile and when I wasn’t impressed at all by my first sip, and I was worried that I let it sit too long, but after a few more sips, it’s kind of grown on me. I just think my taster needed an adjustment as this isn’t tasting bad at all now that I’ve knocked down 4-5 ounces. Okay, now that my palate is in order, this beer tastes quite roasty, almost ashy, mildly bitter, only lightly sweet, with a mild note of sour cherries shadowing over the flavor and a mild smokiness in the finish. Aroma of roast, molasses, and again, that slight sour cherry aroma. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated, but the flavor sticks to the palate for a long-lasting finish. Ruddy brown in color and fairly cloudy to boot, so this beer has kind of a murky translucence. Small, off-white head settles quickly to a filmy layer. A pretty decent beer once I was actually ready for it.
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Bottle. Aroma of soured malt, very nasty. Taste, not as bad as the aroma would suggest. This brew actually grew on me as I drank it, but only a little bit. My first impression was to pour it down the sink, but I actually drank over half the bottle before doing this. Flavour: too sweet, and a weak but ever-present sourness that I wish would go away. A slight metallic tinge. Not much complexity in the malt flavour, and barely any hops. Quite a disappointment to me. And I did not finish it, which says a lot.
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Not as impressed with this Williamsburg than I am of the other beverages in this line, though I did enjoy it. A very sweet smell that is followed by an equally sweet taste. Smooth, and a very nice finish.
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Hazy chestnut brown. Aroma suggestive of caramel, tea, and a bit of metal. Tea more prominent in the flavor, along with some clearly roasted, even smoke notes. There’s a sour edge in there too, someplace. Moderate body, slightly astringent finish. Not very pleasing, all told.
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Very much like an alt, sweet malts with some toffee, a handful of spices in the brightly hopped finish. Very smooth palate. I really liked this, could easily drink it all day long.
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Weird, I really don’t understand the low ratings here. I found this to be a quaffable, sweetish beer. Despite the brown ale labelings, anything called stock ale is going to make me expect altbier - and that’s basically what I found in this one. Its basically a softened up version of alt. A nice well rounded melanoidiny malt is the main feature here. Some slight hops in the nose, but mainly just the toffee/cookie character. The finish is balanced, and this is where it departs from being a true alt, lacking that big long bitter finish. But still, regardless of how to interpret it stylistically, I found it to be a well balanced melanoidin based ale. I would pronounce it distinctly potable. Attractive copper color, too.
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Yech -- very bland -- for some reason, I expected this to be like Sam Adams Boston Stock Ale (which I personally like) but it didn’t come close. Did they use any hops at all?? Low/no carbonation -- I was very disappointed in this and I bought a whole Sixer!!!! Maybe the dog will like it, or if not the drain. Thumbs down.
Williamsburg Stock Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Williamsburg Brewing Company;Heavy cherry buttery smell, diacetyl. Some sweet maltiness. Brownish dark red, slight haze. Supposed to be bottle conditioned, but no sediment. Medium watery body, medium carbonation. Starts with sweetness, sugar, and a Jelly Belly Buttered Popcorn taste. Mild acidity toward finish. Sweetness sticks around, with some biscuit. Finish is buttery and stale, with dry cherrywood after.
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Typical mass produced low alcohol pub bitter, it's ok if the pub you happen to find yourself in have nothing else
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Cask at Hare and Hounds, Appleby. Clear amber appearance with medium sized lasting white head. Aroma is malty and roasted. Flavour is nutty, roasted and smooth.
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);"Cask at the Fox & Hounds, West Burton. I've always detested this in keg and can so was interested to see what it was like in cask. Lookswise, it's much the same -amber-brown with a white head and a light sparkle (it was served in very good condition). The taste though is massively better - a decent malty flavour with sweet toffee, nuts and a dry woodiness, followed by a pleasant balancing bitterness. It is, admittedly, rather thin and watery, but that almost makes it more drinkable, and thus more suited to it's role as a session bitter. I was pleasantly surprised by this (especially the woodiness); it's such a shame that its reputation has been so badly tarnished by the godawful keg version."
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);"Dark amber to chestnut colour, moderate sized slightly amberish white head; aroma of toasted rye bread, some floral, toasted nutty and butterscotch notes; taste of dried fruity, roasted nutty, butterscotch and floral notes; surprisingly good ale...or maybe it is just because of the atmosphere ( tasted in a pub in England during the semi-final of Englad vs. Croatia at 1:0) :)"
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Liverpool 2018, light brown, white head. aroma of caramel, toffee, creamy head, thin, dry, malts, ok-ish
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);not has this in many years but I can't say i have missed it. Low quality English ale
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Cask @ The Board Inn, Howden, East Yorkshire. Chestnut brown. Clear body, malt and a touch of sweetness, bit dull really. A favourite with traditional older British bitter drinkers.
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Cask at the Blue Post in North Frodingham. Dry, earthy, malty and biscuity. Better than I remembered to be fair, certainly better than the canned bitter.
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);Seems to be the go to pint when all the bar has is Fosters and Corona. Where do you start? It looks good, it is full bodied and the taste is creamy, malty and inoffensive (which scores it 80% of its points), but beyond that its an English old man?s session beer, sorry. A bit like silky dish water. Without sounding snobish, people buy this simply because pubs they frequent sell it and that?s what they remember getting merry on last time. Still, its not the worst beer I’ve ever had.
John Smith's Cask;Tadcaster, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;John Smiths (Heineken UK);I was really surprised to find I had never reviewed/rated this beer having drank it thinking I have over a number of years. Anyway I had two hand-pulled pints in two different pubs while in Filey, Yorkshire on 21st Aug 2016. Bog standard, but decent UK Bitter, brown bodied, full off-white head. More maltys notes in both the nose and taste than whatever hops are used, easy drinking session Bitter than looked after correctly can (and was on the 21st Aug) be well worth trying.
Big Horn Light;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);This one confused five tasters at the brewpub in Seattle. Unanimous choice for the worst drainpour of the evening, completely flavorless, like drinking a glass of suds. What confused us is, why would you serve a beer like this.
Big Horn Light;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Clear yellow with a white head. Aroma is full of grain and nothing else. Flavor is full of grain, malty sweetness and a hint of lemon and grass. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very bland.
Big Horn Light;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Sampler at Arlington brewpub. Comes as Juan Moore. Pale gold with thin white head. Mild aroma of malt and grain. Taste is weak grain and malt. Very watery.

Big Horn Light;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Pours pale yellow with very little head. Aroma is hay, light malt, pretty much just smells like a lager. Taste is a hint of watered down malt. Pretty much what you’d expect.
Big Horn Light;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);draft... at Humperdrinks still called the Juan Moore... piss water colored, no head... the nose has a weird peanut butter infection note, terribly off... tastes is sweet water, not much flavor, skunked finish, is what is expected

Boyne River 10:30 Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;Nice hoppy nose but a maltiness too reminiscent of American standard lagers, when it shows up.
Boyne River 10:30 Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;Far more hops than the usual blonde ale and a fine soft mouthfeel that is a good vehicle for the hops. The malt action is subdued, gentled into simplicity, but there's enough character in this to make it worth consideration.
Boyne River 10:30 Ale;Boyne City, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Boyne River Brewing Company;This is the beer they usually have on tap for people who aren't into drinking beer. It's OK - pretty light, but has some flavor.
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;"Real cherry? Hey, count me in as a fan of Sam Adams Cherry Wheat, but the real thing is even better. Aroma is strong sweet/sour cherry, and emanates from an appropriately red body (including a pink-tinged head!). Flavor is a medley of typical cherry aspects: some sours, some sweets, some bitters, and some woody hints (note: some woodies was edited). I agree with hoppygrrrl that cinnamon plays a role here. I also have a hard time finding the ""ale"" beneath the cherry, but this is still good brew, although a notch or two below the Ichabod."
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Lovely, rich, cherry color with dense bubbles, and a crisp cherry aroma (I even get some cinnamon in the nose - scent's a bit like a cherry candle). Fizzy, hoppy, bitter, and sweet. Quite good!
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;The aroma is sweet, flavor is rich with cherries but its also kinda skunky, Amber/red color, pink foamy head, the palate is a little on the thin side, the finish begins sweet with a slight alcohol bite and ends with a tart aftertaste, I didn't really like the tart aftertaste, but its an interesting ale that deserves a try
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Very suprised at the mediocre ratings of this brew. I thought it one of the most successful pairings of fruit and ale I've tried. Beautiful deep garnet color with loads of suspended yeast when held to a bright light, a sustaining white head with a pink tinge (which may be just reflective of the brew.) The aroma is fantastic: loads of cherry, ginger, cinnamon, and some clove qualities. Full maltiness complimented by the tart cherry mouthfeel. This buries Unibroue in my opinion. A fantastic brew to bring in the summer and should cellar beautifully.
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;"Well, there's an ale under there somewhere, it's just darn hard to find. Not impossible, though; there's some hop action that survives the tart, acidic, also slightly sweet cherry onslaught. It's made with cherry juice. I like it, but I think I like fruit stouts better. And this is way more beery than, say, New Glarus's Raspberry, IMO."
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Whooa, I don''t like this.The cherry taste didnt sit well with me. I just wanted to finish it quick and get it over with.
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Deep inhale of cherry brandy, looks like tart cherry juice, the taste is sharp with cherry soda action and ... soap. I'm not kidding. Might be a Cherry Ale to rival the one in Pontiac (at King's) were it not for the unmistakable soapy presence. That, combined with the cherry intensity, helps diminishing the feeling that you're actually drinking beer.
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Interesting beer, dark rose colour. Not tart and not sweet. I don't quite know how to describe it, a bit acidic?
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Tart and sweet at the same time. Medicinal for sure, and I liked this more than Sam Adam's Cherry wheat, for example. Refreshing but I would ease off the cherry a bit and allow the body of the beer to show through. Overall well done.
New Holland Cherry Ale;Holland, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;New Holland Brewing Company;Red color. Cinnamon, spicy, sort of cough medicinish nose. Spicy, tart, some cherry flavor, quite dry. Finally a cherry beer that isn't just a lager with concentrated fruit juice and sugar added. Nice work on this one.
Traverse Shandy;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Traverse Brewing;Not bad, but I don’t know if I would buy it. I’d be better off buying a packet of Kool-Aid. It’s a hell of a lot cheaper.
Traverse Shandy;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Traverse Brewing;"Hazy light yellowish body, thin off-white head. The aroma and flavor are essentially that of lemonade, the kind one makes using lemon concentrate (purchased in those little yellow plastic ""lemons"" at the grocery store), sugar, and several ounces of water. The only hint of beer is a slightly bitter aftertaste. The finish becomes cloying after awhile. If this wasn’t classified as beer I’d enjoy it more, but there is little in the world of beerdom to remark on here."
Traverse Shandy;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Traverse Brewing;Pale gold like a belgian white. No head. Smells like a hard lemonade. Tastes like Mikes Hard Lemonade except not as sour. A little bit like lemon peel too. If you make a shandy with regular beer it tastes a heck of a lot better than this. This stuff really sucks. I have to pour out the rest of this. This is one of the worst beers I have ever had in my life. I give it a 2 in flavor simply because yes it does have some flavor even if it is horrible horrible stuff. Even my wife thinks this stuff really sucks.
Traverse Shandy;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Traverse Brewing;I like lemonade, i don’t like shandy. I will niether recommend nor drink this beer again.
Traverse Shandy;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Traverse Brewing;An assault on the senses: cloying, cheap, lemon drop pop. Ugh..............
Traverse Shandy;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Traverse Brewing;Fuckin awful. I would rather toss a 80 year old's salad than suffer through this terrrible swill. The iceman, funk, and myself had a sixer of this at least 5 years ago and its shittiness still sticks out in my mind.
Traverse Shandy;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Traverse Brewing;If you take the sh from shit , and the andy from candy then you have this sick ass product. If you've ever heard of ass in a can then this is fruit flavored ass in a can, and its 2.5 percent. Maybe I'll have one after i finish my odoul's.
Traverse Shandy;Williamsburg, Michigan, United States;Radler / Shandy;Traverse Brewing;Well, it's not bad, but it's not beer. Does what's required of it, I guess.
E. J. Phair Brown Ale;Pittsburg, California, United States;Brown Ale;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Sparkles in the glass (didn't know until I saw soemone else's). Slight grain tannins, mildly spritzy but that's welcome, a little more deeply roasted than my favorite browns and yet there's some good cocoa in there along with some interesting esters. This was another happy accident in brewing -- a creative mixture of two beers to come up with something different. Another reason to rate outside of styles.
E. J. Phair Shortys Revenge;Pittsburg, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Pours dirty and murky into a British tulip imperial pint glass. The rusty chestnut tint is a lovely sight for traditional Olde English style Bitter ale enthusiasts. The aroma is bit underwhelming for such malty beer, but a pleasant roasted coffee smell prevails. This Ale is full flavored and hearty, revealing hints of walnut and roast malts. Definitely more suited to cold weather, but I'm slurping it down in 80 plus degree Pittsburg, CA and it's devilishly satisfying. The finish is long for a non barrel aged beer, caramel and boozy heat makes it a great dessert. Over all this is a solid representation of the style. Cheers EJ Phair!
E. J. Phair Shortys Revenge;Pittsburg, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Amber in color. Lots of toffee and caramel in the nose and flavor with hints of chocolate malt and roast. Good.
E. J. Phair Shortys Revenge;Pittsburg, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;On tap @ EJ Phair - Concord. Ruby colored beer with a small off-white head. Big time sweetness of table sugar, caramel, and toffee. Light pine hop character to go with it. Has some fruity ester qualities to it as well. Maybe a light nuttiness to the flavor? It’s just very sweet and intensely sugary for me. Not a fan.
E. J. Phair Shortys Revenge;Pittsburg, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Draft. Red/orange color small head. Sweet hops, citrus and toasted almond aroma. Medium body with a long dry nutty finish. I wouldn’t say its an amazing Belgian Strong, it feels more like a really nice hoppy brown. Either way it’s definitely pintworthy.
E. J. Phair Shortys Revenge;Pittsburg, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;A decent red, but something weird about it. Pours a great amber color with a tan head. Smells fruity. Taste is fruity too, but a strange aftertaste. Had at tap at the Bay Area Craft Beer Festival ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
E. J. Phair Shortys Revenge;Pittsburg, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;A - Served a clear copper-red color with a thin layer of white head. The head fades down slowly leaving behind some good lacing. S - Aroma is a mix of rich tasted caramel malts with some light dark fruit sweetness and a hint of booze. T - Starts off with sweet rich caramel malts with a touch of spice. Through the middle some more malt flavor comes through with a bit of hop and some light booze. The finish is a mix of rich malts with some light spice and a touch of booze. M - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a mellowing warming and a sweet finish. D - Very drinkable. Pretty good balance of flavors but just maybe a touch thin bodied.
E. J. Phair Shortys Revenge;Pittsburg, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Glad to see E.J. Phair brewing again, although they have have been hit or miss in the past. This had a strong and clean malt, muted hop flavor but overly bitter. Still worked out okay, but not quite there.

E. J. Phair Shortys Revenge;Pittsburg, California, United States;Strong Ale - English;E. J. Phair Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Pours dark copper with a sllight off-white head. Aroma is very mild and indistinct. Flavor is smooth darkly roasted caramel. Except for a mild fruitiness it hasn’t got all that much flavor and is something of a clone of Newcastle Brown, though better. It does drink really well. Ends more fruity than anything. Quite smooth.
Stumptown Rat Bastard Pale Ale;Guerneville, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stumptown Brewery;On tap at RateBeer Best. Pours copper with small off white head that lasts. The aroma is citrus and pine. Medium body, grass, earth, pine, bitter finish, good.

Mammoth Charleywine;Mammoth Lakes, California, United States;Old Ale;Mammoth Brewing Company;"""next to Bourbon aged Olde Bluehair, there was no vanilla to speak of in this beer. not a bad beer, but it was the first letdown from previously dependable Mammoth Brewing. Aroma was a nice balance of sweet musty malts and hops, but was a little flat. Dark, almost black ruby tinged body. The flavor was ok as well...for a porter. NOT a big beer worthy of a Brewer’s Reserve label. The body was the weakest link...10%? Really? Olde blue hair at 8.75 had twice the body. Mammoth’s weakest offering to date. Average beer overall, subpar for the style."""

Craftsman Triple White Sage;Pasadena, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Craftsman Brewing Company;One of my favorite beers hands down.

Pizza Port SPF 45 Saison;Solana Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottle (from the november 2005 RB-tasting at Dixens place - notes have been damaged by flooding of my basement, but this was such an insane tasting for me as I was new to such massive tastings, so I gave up on the detailed notes quite early). Hazy, clinging head. Citrus, peach, hops, nuts and velvet.
Pizza Port SPF 45 Saison;Solana Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Maltzilla!!! Honey colored. Smells and tastes of an herbal mead mixed with a saison. Pretty crazy flavor!!!
Pizza Port SPF 45 Saison;Solana Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);A: The pour is a goldenrod sort of color with a large white head that displays some pretty good retention. S: The nose offers up some good spice notes/yeast esters along with bready malts and a moderate sweetness. The citrus notes are pretty much gone on this one, but there is a hint of lemon and lemon zest. T: A fair amount of spice notes opens up the palate: pepper, ginger, and citrus rind. Mildly sweet and bready malts round things out. M: The body is medium with a lively carbonation to it and a really long finish. D: This beer does show some signs of decay, but it has actually held up quite well. That said, I wouldn’t necessarily advise hanging on to this much longer.
Pizza Port SPF 45 Saison;Solana Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);In short: A (probably once excellent) spicy rustic Saison that is past its prime How: Bottle 750ml. Exact age unknown but obviously a few years (too many) old. Tasting session with Montreal crew The look: Cloudy dark golden body topped by an off-white ring of foam In long: The nose is spicy and with a nice Saison character that is more rustic (old dusty attic, rusty) than wild. Taste shows decay. Oxidation, minerals, cookies, herbs, pepper, rust, ginger. Mild tartness. Dry finish with minerals and spices. Body is rather thin. The oxidation sadly overwhelms the Saison yeast character. Age has not been good to this beer. This was probably once an amazing beer because I still enjoyed it despite being obviously past its prime. I wish I could have had it a few years ago but sadly I came too late. Usually my problem is that I come too soon.

Pizza Port SPF 45 Saison;Solana Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);750ml aged bottle shared by CaptainCougar. Murky orange-brwon color. Crazy unique gingerbread aroma. Lots of ginger and herbal sweetness in the flavor. Very soft on the palate, with some black pepper as well. Fluffy and light. GIngerbread really comes through solidly to me, with some brown sugar smooth out by the funky, at times tart, herbs. Unique and quite enjoyable.

Flavor has continental malts, light caramel, seville oranges, tart apples, grains of paradise, apple cider vinegar. Finish is mildly tart and fairly dry. Overall a very interesting beer. Although I’m not that experienced with saisons, this doesn’t seem very traditional. Nevertheless, it is very unusual and fairly good.
Pizza Port SPF 45 Saison;Solana Beach, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);"Thank you Guy! for this treasure. This aged (unlabeled) 750 ml bottle poured murky like unfiltered cider with aroma of coconut and currants. Tastes like coconut oil and raisin paste, and I have to agree with Brad that this one tastes also like marzapan. Medium bodied and multi-layered; remarkable for undetectable hops or alcohol, while still not cloying and still balanced."
Pizza Port SPF 8 Saison;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Bottle @ Hotel. Thanks, Alex. Black pour with only mild carbonation and a khaki head that doesn’t last long. Sort of a musty, oxidized nose. A lot of soy sauce and herbs. Licorice, some cocoa powder, and chocolate syrup. The flavor is a touch ashy and is fairly roasty. A really heavy dose of soy sauce and old herbs makes this sort of weirdly savory. A lot of old milk chocolate. Some caramel and grass. Just kind of stale.

Bottle pours a dark brown color with off white head. I surprised this was a saison. Considering its been aging a while this may be normal.

Craftsman Beer Mountain Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Craftsman Brewing Company;A: The pour is a dark amber color with a tan head. S: The nose is quite smokey and salty with a big of a woody/bacon/nut aroma to it. T: A ton of smoke, wood, and salt flavor to this that is somewhat astringent and not all that pleasant. M: The body is medium with a moderate level of carbonation. D: Not the most intense of the smoked beers I’ve had, but you still have to really enjoy the smoke to want to drink too much of this one.

It’s slightly sweet and spicy wtih a hint of orange. The spicyness is a little much...I think this could have been a much better beer if the spice fit with the orange a little better. Light to medium bodied, tingly from the carbonation and a touch warming.
Craftsman Orange Grove Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Craftsman Brewing Company;I remember when I moved to CA in August they were out of this at Lucky Baldwin’s. Now that I see the cycle of a year I know when they are in stock. Warms my heart. ANYWAY... a nice fruit beer, though not as fruity as some might like. I had to search a little too hard for the orange, and even then came up with mostly orange peel.
Craftsman Orange Grove Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Craftsman Brewing Company;Lightly malty aroma with a little light orange. Orange amber color. More beer than oranges in the initial flavor. Nice malt profile. Finish is a very nice natural orange flavor - like orange juice. A nice fruit beer.

Craftsman Orange Grove Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Craftsman Brewing Company;Is this an amber ale with some orange or a fruit beer that has an amber ale basis? Whatever... The orange flavor nicely complements the beer. Wish I’d see this on tap more often. Had this at the stone 11th.
Craftsman Orange Grove Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Craftsman Brewing Company;Facinating beer - maybe the first orange fruit beer I’ve ever tried. Big sweet juicy orange aroma, bitter smooth flavour, and subtle maltiness made this an interesting offering. I’d definitely try this again, its not like other fruit beers that just taste like sparkling fruit juice.
Craftsman Orange Grove Ale;Pasadena, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Craftsman Brewing Company;"Sampled on tap at Lucky Baldwin’s, June 2007 The beer is lightly hazy with a darkish honey amber color. The head is frothy, tan colored and starts out about a finger and a half thick and even leaves some lacing on the sides of my glass. The aroma is not as orange smelling as I was expecting; soft notes of oranges zest, some pith aromatics (which could be a malt contribution). There is a touch of biscuit like malt, but all in all the aroma is quite muted overall. The taste is lightly sweet and citrus flavors accentuate a light tartness. This almost has a creamy mouthfeel to it, though it is quite light bodied. There is something here that reminds me of watered down orange juice (I would hope that actual juice was not used for this, but you never know). This is not bad, but it seems a bit washed out. It makes me wonder if they in fact did use orange juice instead of orange peel (which is actually were a lot of the flavor is)."
Ukiah Orr Springs IPA;Ukiah, California, United States;IPA;Ukiah Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. Pours Amber with a creamy white head. Aroma seems floral pine with nice caramel. The malt is fairly strong, but the is bitter enough to handle it. Sturdy IPA.

Ukiah Orr Springs IPA;Ukiah, California, United States;IPA;Ukiah Brewing Company;Pours a chill hazed, rusty amber body, with a creamy, tightknit, offwhite head that floats two fingers above the body. Exceptional head retention eventually drops into fluffy clumps of sticky lace. Lots of minute bubbles are apparent in the body, madly rushing upward. Very nice to behold. Aroma is inviting and heavy handed. Fresh, leafy, hops lead off with citrusy grapefruit, orangerind, and spruce. Some toffee and caramel notes become more apparent as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety carbonation and a tingly bite of fresh hops resin. Taste is surprisingly, well balanced. Hoppy bitterness is dry and assertive, with grapefruit, citrus rind, and spruce. Sweet/Tart tangerine and a dollop of clover honey emerge after a few minutes of warming. A solid malt backbone of toffee and caramel becomes prominent at room temperature and provides a superlative balance to the bitter, leafy, hoppiness. A note of clover honey chimes in, as well, as the citrusy aspect veers toward a sweeter tangerine and pink grapefruit presence. Some mild alcohol warmth adds to the complexity near the finish.
Ukiah Orr Springs IPA;Ukiah, California, United States;IPA;Ukiah Brewing Company;Light yellow, very light for an IPA. Sweet hopped nose with vanilla, peaches, grapes... really nice. Good bitterness, like chinook hops... crisp.
Ukiah Orr Springs IPA;Ukiah, California, United States;IPA;Ukiah Brewing Company;Tap. Dark golden color with a tan head. Good hop aroma. Bitter flavor yet rather generic.
Ukiah Orr Springs IPA;Ukiah, California, United States;IPA;Ukiah Brewing Company;Cascade and Yakima Chief hops all over this one. Huge pine, pepper and juniper in the nose and finish. This is nearly 100% organic to boot. Excellent and packs a whallop.

Streichs Naked Fish/Naughty Fish;West Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Streichs Brewing Co.;Aroma is sweet and hoppy. Flavor is intensely hoppy -- floral and slight grapefruit. Still, the hops don''t oppress, overwhelm or leave it with a one-dimensionality. Nice beer.
Streichs Naked Fish/Naughty Fish;West Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Streichs Brewing Co.;"Uhh...it''s actually ""naughty fish"", but I''m sure someone''s already mentioned that. A good pale ale, with that american twist. Lots of cascade and maybe columbus hops, with a light malty background. A good drink, especially after busting your ass doing some chore your wife tells you to do. Please believe it!"

Flavor is very sour lemon, sweeter, wheat. Body has a pretty intense sourness with big bubbled carbonation. Sour lemon all around.
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;Murky dark gold yellow color with great two finger head. Explosively carbonated, no joke. Just about lost an eye when I popped off the cap. It burst off and ricocheted off my ceiling. Needless to say, this was one of the most aggressively carbonated beers ive had, which actually worked very well with the beer. Lots of citrus and some banana flavors. Some tartness and spices too, but not a ton. Medium light bodied. I had a hoegaarden after this one, and much to my surprise because of the kings carbonation, the hoegaarden tasted flat.
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;bottle. has an aroma of wheat and grapes.pours a golden yellow with lots of carbonation and little head.bit of an orange flavor with a bitter finish. good but not as good as expected.
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;Clear pale body with a tiny white head. The aroma is banana, bread and light clove. The flavor is banana, metallic and cotton candy. Medium/light body with soft carbonation.
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;Cloudy straw gold with a couple inches of sudsy off white foam. Very good head retention, sparse foamy lacing. Sweetish wheat and clove in the aroma. Sweet bready wheat flavor with some pungeant spice and yeast character. A touch of white pepper. Green hop and tangerine bitterness in the finish and into the aftertaste. Medium body, solid carbonation. A nice Americanized version.
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;12 oz bottle pretty fresh. Poures a dark orangish with a little haze no head whatsoever. Aroma were slightly wheaty with some yeasty spice. Flavors were mild with some clove and wheat light citrus as well Not a big beer but not bad
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;"King Weissbier (""Bavarian Style Wheat Beer""). I assume this rating belongs here. Hazy orange-yellow body, thin off-white head. Banana, clove, and bubblegum aroma. Typical hefeweizen flavors of banana and clove, pretty potent on those notes, with a slightly tart, spicy finish. Creamy, somewhat heavy-feeling body. A bit undercarbonated. Decent."
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;On tap: Yeasty banana aroma. Dark cloudy orangish-yellow with a small white head. Yeast and banana up front with a light citrus finish. A little watery.
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;Tap. Wow, the other guys must have had a bad batch. I had this one at Kings. It was a pleasure to watch. Poured into the proper glass, this one was just a flurry of bubbles, with a great head and beautiful golden color. The bubbles just kept coming. Great aromas, fruit and malt. This one roils around in your mouth, the flavors are on the sweet side, very good.
King Hefeweizen;Pontiac, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;King Brewing Company;Draft at 2004 MBG Summer Festival. Poured a very, very small white head with fine sized bubbles. Uncarbonated, cloudy and a yellow hue. Malty, banana, spicy and clove aroma. Malty, sweet, banana, spices and clove flavor from start to finish. Smooth palate. Medium bodied beer with fair lacing.
Pizza Port Acacia Amber Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Decent tasting amber. Not worth the cost though. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Pizza Port Acacia Amber Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Fruity aroma (cranberry like), amber ale isn't a way to describe this beer, super fruity and an alcholic kick in the finish..this super strong ale weighs in at 9% alcohol
Pizza Port Acacia Amber Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);fruity, mainly from dried cranberries, and blessed with a floral/spicy aroma. very Belgian in character, warming and unique
Pizza Port Acacia Amber Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Touch of cranberries, honey, cinnamon, curacao and coriander. Light medium bodied but full aroma and flavor.
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;The head is ok, the body brown. It smells malty, bit alcoholic, darkmalty, grain. The taste is malty, bit dry bit alcoholic-dry, maltaromatic, less hoppy. Nice, not that sweet like the most Dopppelbock in Germany but on his dry way very tasty.
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;Draft at Bel-Aire, recommended by Ray, thank you sir! Nice variegated amber brown color, small beige head with good retention. Aroma of lightly toasted caramel and nuts. Taste is sweet and malty with a bit of roasted nuts. Very nice.
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;Bottled. An amber beer with a thin beige head. The aroma has notes of malt and caramel as well as lighter notes of pumpernicle bread, alcohol, and honey. The flavor is sweet with notes of cardboard, dusty hops, caramel, and alcohol, that makes its mark felt on the tongue. The finish contains a bit of strored fruit. Thanks Papsoe for sharing.
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;Chocolatey with allspice and candied fruit aromas and flavours. A pleasant drop made well but not as forceful as authentic doppelbocks that I have tasted in the past. But credit where it is due, at least it is within style guidelines unlike a certain mainstream NZ brewery’s doppelbock down to the -ator name.
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;Bottle. Pours a deep mahogany brown with a brief medium brown head. Aroma is very nice-- sweet brown bread, molasses, chocolate. Oddly, these all fade before the glass is half consumed, leaving a woody caramel aroma behind. Flavours of bread crusts, treacle, chocolate, and hints of coffee are all nice. Medium bodied, and despite the ABV there is no trace of booziness or alcohol. Finish is mildly bitter. Nice.
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;Bottle 33cl. Clear medium red - brown amber color with a average, frothy to creamy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate to heavy malty, roasted, bread - grainy. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and light bitter with a average to long duration. Body is medium, texture is watery to oily, carbonation is soft. (220808)
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;(Bottle 33 cl) Clear, deep amber golden with a small, off-white head. Sweetish aroma of hard roasted malt and pumpernickel. Solid and full body with notes of sweetish roasted malt and pumpernickel. Finishes dry. 220808
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;Bottle, shared by papsoe. It pours an amber, clear body with a decent beige head. Malty nose with caramel and beefstock. The flavor is on the malty side too, with a little fruity touch. Caramel, beefstock and some roasted notes. Caramel-malty finish. Medium body with a pleasant cabonation. Far from my favorite doppelbock, but a decent beer. (080822)
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;12 fl oz bottle. Pours clear and golden hazzlenut brown with a lacing off-white head. Barley and malty roasted aroma. Sweet flavour of barley, caramel and mild breadish. Lingering malty and slight breadish. Light alcohol presence and warmth into the finish.
Nelson Bays Exclamator Doppelbock;Tahunanui, New Zealand;Bock - Doppelbock;Nelson Bays Brewery;Bottle, pours a deep brown colour with a large foamy off white head. A malty aroma, sweet and a little grainy, with noticeable alcohol and vinous hops. A full malty palate, chocolately, with the finish interestingly mellow but short. Can’t put my finger on exactly why, but I like this.
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;Amber-brown, really nice bright fruity tip note. That manuka tip note is bright, the base amber is ok, and that.
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;Bottle. Huge spiy, resinous nose. Sweet and spicy with resins from the manuka tips. Wax, chocolate, caramel, soft body, cinnamon spice. Not my thing. Too strong in the resins.
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;On tap. Pours orange brown. Peach, honey, sage, little synthetic grape, lemon. Decent body. Good stuff.
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;On tap at Brew Craft Beer Pub Tauranga. Slight hop aroma with pine and sulfur notes. Dark amber brown with OK head which dissipates quickly. Mild bitterness with smooth malt body and lingering hop bitterness. Also a slight astringency perhaps from the Manuka. Not bad by any stretch.
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;Draft at Hashigo Zake in Wellington. Clear reddish amber color with a small head. Aroma is very herbal, wood, berries. Flavor is medium sweet, herbal slight bitterness, stone fruits. Medium bodied, well carbonated. Interesting.
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;[8223-20160510] Tap. Floral taffy and herbal wildflower cleaner and nail polish remover aroma. Clear, dark amber body with a quick foamy white head and some light lacy lacing. Bitter floral evergreen taffy flavour has a floral sweet cleaner-like finish. Medium body. Interesting but strange as a beer. (7/3/6/3-/11) 3.0 (@ Brew, Rotorua, NZ)
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;2016-05-10. Crisp dark amber body, modest off white head. Aroma has an interesting almost spicy green herbaceous vegetation character that reminds me a bit of Anchor OSA. Flavour is interesting, green herbaceous character, moderate bitterness throughout. Average bodied palate, good carbonation. Tasty, fairly different. 7/3/6-7/3/15-16 On tap at Brew, Rotorua, NZ.
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;On tap. Artificial drug store shampoo aroma with a bit of roasted caramel. This is just an experiment which went wrong.
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;"Pours a deep mahogany, not quite bright, with sparse, fine carbonation. Head settles to a thin pad of tight beige bubbles and manages a thin lace weave. Strange aniseedy, herbal, almost medicinal nose that also shows hints of spruce, stewed rhubarb and mushrooms, Benadryl cough medicine and paperbark. Similar on the palate; medicinal and woody with a complex herbal flavour not dissimilar to Unterberg aperitif. Dowdy, astringent berry finish with licks of aniseed, paperbark and rhubarb. Fades off quickly. Body is medium light with soft carbonation and an oily finish. Not altogether tasty or appetising. Would love to try a fresh sample; this one seems a little beyond its used by. One for a re-rate! (33cL, no date stamp, Cellarbrations Carlisle)"
Mussel Inn Captain Cooker Manuka Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;The Mussel Inn;(On tap) Clear copper with slight white head. Nice floral aroma - rather reminiscent of rose petals.Light body and medium carbonation. Taste is light, refreshing and elegant. Slightly honey sweet, floral with a hint of stone fruit and negligible bitterness. Nice easy drinking beer.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;A hint of hop smell but not much. Gold colour and average carbonation. Tastes OK, but the company makes much better than this. This beer is a carry on from the previous owners and not a Kraft bier. Definately drinakable on a hot sunny East Coast day. Would go great with prawns.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;Tap pour. Pours a light gold with slight white head. Strong lager nose. Medium body with the clear lager front flavours and a hidden sweetness at the end. Would take a 12 pack of this over any mainstream lager.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;330ml bottle BB 3/5/2017 Fruity aroma with a touch of malt. Pale gold color with OK head. Medium bitterness with a understated malt finish. OK for this style but nothing special.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;For a lager this one is not that back - more sweet malts than expected give this a bit of flavour to at least make it interesting.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;Light malt and hops. A little grass, a touch of honey, a bit of metal and a bit of plastic. Good carbonation pushes the decent level of bitterness (decent for this kind of beer) forward a tad and tingles the tongue. Better than green-bottle macro slosh.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;Pale gold color with an everlasting bright white head. Pale malt flavor and aroma. Not much else. Light body.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;500ml bottle pours pale & frothy, light malt grassy aroma with a bitter mildly hoppy taste that finishes quite dry, very refreshing
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;It’s probably about time I reviewed this beer given its long standing, but you just don’t get it in the South Island of New Zealand. It is as it says on the label, a golden lager that also has a white head and large bubbly carbonation. It looks like a classic lager in the glass and has a very light malt aroma and subtle metallic hopping. It isn’t the most complex beer - mild maltiness and little else to commend it to beer snobs. It tasted to me like Mack’s Gold used to taste prior to Lion’s takeover. An aperitif beer? I bet it has never been described as that before, but that’s how and why I had it and it fit its purpose well.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;Draft at Beervana. Crystal clear pale yellow color, fluffy white head. Aroma of whitenpepper and hay. Taste is peppery straw. Light body.
Sunshine Gisborne Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sunshine Brewery;The first sip reminded me of opening a bag of hops. Great drinker, interesting and unintrusive hop profile. It’s not trying to new a highly hoped pils, that is the green’s job. Instead it is an easy drinking yet satisfying pale lager. I would order this over a steinlager, stella or carona any day.
Sunshine Xtra Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sunshine Brewery;This is just a wonderful beer. Tastes great and doesn't have a bad after taste.
Sunshine Xtra Gold;Gisborne, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Sunshine Brewery;Based on the name and this breweries other products, I was sure that this beer would suck. But it was better than expected. A somewhat acceptable pils with a bit of hop flavour.
Roosters Brew House Black Cockerels Stout;Hastings, New Zealand;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Roosters Brew House (NZ);Dark black in colour with thick creamy head that bar tender wiped off. Thin body but lave thin hoppy residue on roof of mouth. More of a schwartzbier than a stout. Bonus point for hand pump.
Roosters Brew House Black Cockerels Stout;Hastings, New Zealand;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Roosters Brew House (NZ);Mellow and chocoltey to start with a hop bitterness developing late, accompanied by some decent hop flavour. Silky smooth mouthfeel.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);The head is impressive on this red/brown ale The flavour has initial light sweetness and hints of licorice, and then mostly malt and a brief hint of smoke. There is a very low bitterness in the short finish.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);50 cl bottle. Yeast at the bottom. Reddish bown colour with a nice head. Malty aroma with notes of oak, sugar and hints toffee. Nice sweet flavour with notes of roastedness, chocolate and some hoppy finish. Ends up dry and very little bitter. Very drinkable.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Hop malt aroma and nor much else. Murky brown caramel colour with great head and lacing. Sweet malt flavour. Not expecting a sweet beer. Fizzy palate.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours a hazy brown with a substantial tanned head. Sweet and quite dry. Dusty with brown sugar, some caramel and roasted malts and fine tones of flowery hops. A hint of coffee in the dry finish. Wish I´d had this and other Emerson beers instead of Speight´s when I was in Dunedin.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);12 Feb 06 - LIght fruit malt aroma. Cloudy brown colour, nice head retention. Light sweet roasted malt flavour. Tangy hop finish.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Hazy amber colour with a dense tan head. Malty aroma with hints of caramel and nuts. Malty, light roasted flavor with a faint caramel sweetness and a dry buttery finish.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Fluffy golden tan head, hazy brownreddish body. Dry and dusty aroma with lots of spices and malt. Rather sweet with tones of brown sugar. Dry sourish flavor with bready and spicy notes. Thin in the body with a bitter spicy end. An atypical brown ale and not very balanced.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Fruity hop aroma. Cloudy chestnut colour. Malty flavour. Mouthfeel is quite swelling, too much for my liking.
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);(Bottle 50 cl) In a blind tasting I would never ever have guessed this to be a brown ale. The beer has a dry, sourish tone that rather takes after a Flemish Oud Bruin. Amber coloured with some impurities. Very lively and bubbly carbonation that really fills the mouth. Very unusual. 211204
Emerson's DBA;Dunedin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A hazy red-brown beer with a disappearing orange head - the haze disappears after a while. The aroma is sweet with notes of roasted bread and prunes. The flavor is sweet with notes of prunes, wood, roasted bread, and a nicely hoppy end.
James Squire Coal Porter;Sydney, Australia;Porter;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Very rich and malty, almost reminded me of a belgium dubbel, could have been the use of sugar. Overall a pleasant brew.
James Squire Coal Porter;Sydney, Australia;Porter;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Now i must admit I have been quite harsh towards Lion Nathan but this is quite a great beer, I enjoy all the Malt Shovel brews....They do have a habit of giving me a headache while drinking them, might be quite a high sugar content.
James Squire Coal Porter;Sydney, Australia;Porter;Malt Shovel Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Sweeter, maltier, and less smoky than their other porter. Chocolate is the predominant flavour here and perhaps a bit of roasted malt once it warms up. But overall, I'm getting a sugary sweetness.
Limburg Tribute Pale Ale;Hastings, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Limburg Brewing Company;This beer has an interesting yeasty flavour similar to what is found in their wheat beers. The flavour is citric overall (from hops) but somewhat sour (from yeast). I'd prefer some more crispness, bite, and malt flavour. The yeasty flavours that work in their wheats are definitely out of place in this beer.
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;only upon memory from a visit there but I do remember it being one exquisite brew.
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;Pours a clear light yellow with a white head. No sweetness just bitterness. Does have a light caramel maltyness. Quite hoppy with aromas of pine and a bit of resin. Medium bodied. Lively carbonation. Bitter finish.
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;One of the last ones that I could find after the announcement that this beer is now defunct. Pours a light brown with no head, it’s never really ever looked good in the glass since they stopped bottle conditioning. Has a rather prickly carbonation to it but a lovely passion fruit nose which is probably due to it now being brewed by the hop king at steam breweries. It’s unfair to judge this bottle because it’s an old on and a wee bit dusty but I have drunk many pints of this and it’s a great beer. One of the only decent beers to be found on tap in Hamilton in the early part of this century so I owe it a huge debt!
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;Bottle 33cl. Clear amber body with normal size off white head. Nose dominated by hops and fruit/citrus. Flavour with bitter sweet hops.
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;(Bottle 33 cl) Pours a clear, deep golden with a creamy, lacing, off-white head. Very pleasant, peachy hop aroma. Medium-bodied with lightly sweet notes of caramel malt and then otherwise completely dominated by the rather sophisticated hop blend that leaves lots of flavour but not so much bitterness. A fantastic session beer. This may be based on an English style but with the Kiwi twist it certainly came out as a brilliant APA. 240108
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of beer_ledgend. Pours copper white with a rocky white head. Smells of citrus, pine, some caramel, spice. Tastes earthy with some peppery splashes and elements of biscuits. Mouthfeel is full with a peppery finish.
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;"A deliciously juicy example of New Zealand brewing. They do a fine line in pale ales brewed with local hops, and this seems to be one of the best. There’s no longer any mention of Fuggles on the label, instead referring to NZ Saaz and ""other New World hops"", which tends to confirm my impression that this is now closer to an APA than an EPA. It’s a cracking beer, whatever the style. There’s very little to fault, from the towering head with lashings of lace to the gloriously fresh and zesty aroma and the exquisitely balanced flavours. Loverly stuff. Gives off big drafts of lychee, passionfruit, orange Fruit Gums, gooseberry greenness and Curacao. Soft carbonation. Tart, juicy tropical fruit with some US APA-style toffee malts and pine. All very restrained and balanced. After starting an NZ holiday with a few duds, this one lifted my whole mood because I knew I had something really good to drink for the rest of the week. (330ml bottle from Scenic Cellars, Taupo)"
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;Love this beer, this years batch of hops have a great passionfruit aroma. Such a clean taste, it’s such a pleasure to drink. Beautiful looking, beautiful tasting!
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;On tap @ Rosies Hastings 19/10/06. Slightly cloudy, big fruity citrus floral nose. Stonefruits, grassy & passionfruit. Big thru to the finish - love it. Nice to meet Chris too...
Limburg Hopsmacker;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steam Brewing Company;I was very happy to have been served this beer when I asked for a recommendation from the barman. I was served from the bottle which gave the beer lingering carbonation which lasted to the very bottom of the glass. It had boatloads of hoppy character and a lingering after-taste matched only by the beers from The Twisted Hop brewery in Christchurch. The orange and coriander complimented the weather outside (dismal) making it very much a comfort beer. The purchase price was justified by the aroma alone, which made me look forward to the next bottle.
Invercargill Cherry Spike;Invercargill, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;Invercargill Brewery;Medium amber-orqange, almost red colour. Mild, tart cherry aroma. Initial flavour is malty with a subtle tart cherry fruit flavour and developing bitterness late.
Burton Bridge Alphabet Soup;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Bridge Brewery;Sampled cask conditioned. Brownish amber and slightly hazy. Neutral nose. Medium bodied. Salty, sulphuric, dry and bitter.
Höss Hirsch-Gold;Sonthofen, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei Höss der Hirschbräu;Fairly sweet and simple Hellas with some cereal notes, but lacks body and overall very uneventful, even very fresh.
Höss Hirsch-Gold;Sonthofen, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei Höss der Hirschbräu;From Hipercor. In Bavaria glass. Playing Darksiders 2. Very malty, with a bit of dank and good body. Its taste and aroma may not stand out, but its really crushable and feels very good in mouth

Höss Hirsch-Gold;Sonthofen, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei Höss der Hirschbräu;Clear straw color with white head. Aroma is clean, slightly lemony and grainy. Taste starts grainy with a slight honey sweetness but balances out on the finish with some clean hop bitterness. Body is medium with medium to low carbonation. Clean is the best word to describe this beer. It’s also balanced and easy to drink but it doesn’t stand out with anything.
Höss Hirsch-Gold;Sonthofen, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei Höss der Hirschbräu;"0,33l Flasche ""Drittelgold"". Goldene klare Farbe mit weissem Schaum. Duft nach Grass und Stroh. Wenig Kohlensäure. Leicht säuerlich im Antrunk, herb im Abgang."

Booths Pour with Care;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Booth's Supermarket;Unusual dry taste with a medium head. Doesn’t resemble any other Batemans beers I have tried. If only all bottle conditioned beers where as nice as this.
Booths Pour with Care;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Booth's Supermarket;Bottle Conditioned, bought from Booth’s, Clitheroe, 500ml. Reddish amber beer with chunky white head. Wow, I don’t usually rate British bottled beers that highly, but this is a bit special. Full impact bitter with a tangy citrusy hop note and a good resinous bitter finish. This is a real belter, so why don’t Batemans make more Bottle Conditioned beers for us to enjoy. Yummy.
Booths Pour with Care;Preston, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Booth's Supermarket;"Brewed for a supermarket chain. Lucky supermarket. This is a russet coloured beer that is big on biscuity malts. To finish there is a slightly ""oaky"" aftertaste. A good bottle conditioned beer."
General Lafayette Lights Out IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Cask: A little better than on the regular tap, most of the same features, although a little more of the bitterness could be tasted at the warmer temperature, great creamy head that stuck on the side of the glass throughout the pint.

Tuatara Pilsner;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);A lot of character, very hoppy for a pilsner, can definitely catch a lot of fruity vibes in the hops.
Tuatara Pilsner;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Bottle. Pours a dark gold colour with a fluffy white, light hop and malt aroma, the taste is medium bitterness and with a dry bitter finish.

Compared with the Czech classics, there is less grain and body. Nice New World (?) Pilsener. These guys are doing a great job.
Tuatara Pilsner;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Light clear yellow colour with white head. Nice smell of lemons, kiwi and grass. Taste of lemon and gooseberry, medium bitterness. Being czech and used to original pilseners I would not consider this pilsener but rather pale ale. Then it is really good.
Tuatara Pilsner;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);"Poured a crystal clear gold with a one-finger bright white frothy head that retained very well before diminishing to a blotchy cap that laced OK. Carbonation moderate to high, quite lively and coarse. Aroma softly of bready malt plus earthy tones; quite larger-like. Taste is slightly sweet with bready malt, slight bitterness and a little citrus flavour. Light body. Smooth, clean, crisp and slightly dry with low bitterness on a moderately long finish."
Tuatara Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Dark yellow pour, white head. Citrus, grainy malt, light fruit. Pretty boring if you ask me.
Tuatara Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Dark golden colour. Malt balanced, slightly buttery, but with adequate hop flavour. Not bad at all.
Tuatara Indian Pale Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;IPA - English;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Es ist ein angenehm fruchtiges IPA mit recht herber Note. Es ist dabei aber nicht zu stark, sodass man es recht leicht trinken kann, auch wenn die Bitterkeit anfangs doch sehr vorprescht.
Tuatara Indian Pale Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;IPA - English;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Restrained aroma in an amber pour. Hop forward balance with laid back body and finish. One of the first base brews from Tuatara and one that helped put them on the map. Not bad in its day - but long since overshadowed.
Tuatara Indian Pale Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;IPA - English;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Bottle shared at a tasting at the Dancing Camel. Thanks Excellent Little Brother! Clear amber-gold with a huge white head. Soapy, limestone and some pine aroma, bitter, soapy and old taste. Light-to-medium body, quite carbonated, orange and soap finish.

Tuatara Indian Pale Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;IPA - English;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);5%ABV. IPA. Poured out amber. 12ºSRM. Mouthfeel is soapy. Palate is light and clean with pale malt, light sweetness suggesting lightly browned toast, wonderbread and sweet dough, keep in mind that the sweet is light but the palate has a nice ponderous sweet bready body. So it’s not all light and sweet. There is a nice slightly sour, fruity body to the palate which suggests juice, maybe some fresh-squeezed orange, especially a cloudy milky fresh-squeezed juice with a lot of pith. YOverall very sour and lemon juicy as far as the palate goes. Hops are resinous, pine, bitter melon, there is an emphasis on bitter rather than the pine or the citrus. So not so much on the parent aromatics and more emphasis on the bitter betas. Finish is medium with a clean bitter back of the throat bitter, which I have come to associate with Columbus. Goes on Favorites List!
Tuatara Indian Pale Ale;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;IPA - English;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Overall, quite an earthy ale. Green melon, orange, lemon, pineapple, floral. Sweet at the front, orange, wood and pine at the back. All flavours and aromas are on the light side and the body is fairly thin, which makes it a very drinkable quencher.
Tuatara London Porter;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Porter;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);"330ml bottle. Darkest brown colour with average, frothy, moderately lasting and lacing, beige head.

Roasted malt, chocolate, some cherry notes (?) and some dryness in the aroma. The flavor is news paper, roasted malt, some ashy dryness and chocolate.
Tuatara London Porter;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Porter;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);330ml bottle. Pours dark. Aroma is chocolate milk. Taste is a little bitter, some chocolate and some prunes. Quite refreshing, and really quite nice. A nice simple porter.

Tuatara London Porter;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Porter;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Average head and body, brown-black in colour. Aroma of swampy barley but not too swampy, but still swampy. Flavour is roasted barley with hints of coffee, but the finish is watery. I like my porters in your face and this is demure at best.
Tuatara London Porter;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Porter;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);"Flasche (33 cl) von Jenny Lou’s, Peking. - Tiefschwarz mit einer dünnen Decke dunkelbeigefarbenen Schaums. - In der Nase überraschend kräftige Hopfenaromen, die an ein IPA erinnern: tropische Frucht, Nadelwald, Menthol, erst dahinter Röstmalz und Mokka. - Antrunk ebenfalls wuchtig hopfenaromatisch, gefolgt von Mokka und Bitterkakao. Malzsüße ist kaum ausgeprägt. Gut rezent, fast etwas zu sehr; schlank und trocken. Im Abgang kräftige holzige Hopfenbittere, beinahe verbranntes Röstmalz und eine deutliche Note von Asche. - Interessantes Porter mit geballten, fast schroffen Hopfen- und Röstmalzaromen."
Tuatara London Porter;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Porter;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Porter’s for me are a time and a place beer. It is not a summer beer nor a beer I can drink all night. Also If I can get Fuller’s London Porter then everything else is an also ran. This however is not bad. I had this in a tiny pub in Taipei near Le-li road down a back street. The body is quite light for a Porter. Nose is coffee, milk chocolate and maybe burnt toast. More carbonation than I expected and a little drier. But that said it had some good crisp dark flavours...such as chocolate and malt. Finish was dry and clean. Very good beer.
Tuatara London Porter;Paraparaumu, New Zealand;Porter;Tuatara Brewing Company (DB Breweries);Bottle. Black with a lovely chocolate like flavour. Hops in background make it feel like a dark IPA rather than an IPA. Nevertheless this is an excellent beer and easily the best I have tried so far from this brewery.
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Pre-ratebeerian days this was one of my favourite ""mainstream"" beers that I drank often, would be good if they re-introduced it."
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Another one from memory, but worthy of it. Was an impressive melding of malt and hops from one of the mainstream breweries - something they haven’t recaptured to the same degree of late. A shame it is no longer being brewed.
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tasted from 2006 notes. Rich amber colour, Aromas of mutued stonefruits and a touch citrus. Odd given the hop description, expecting different. Decent palate, nice flowery hop character, juicy with a touch of warm hop character to finish. Decent
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Hoppy nose. Pours very red with a medium fluffy head. Flavour is hoppy and dry but unfortunately slightly thin and watery. All told it’s not bad, but not amazing.
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A pleasant enough beer to drink, spoilt only by the high price (even here in the south island of New Zealand where it is brewed). The head did not last at all long but the flavour was enough to see me go back for seconds.
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle (and a pretty cool one for a change!): Very slightly hazy amber with a large off-white head. Hoppy aromas of citrus, pine, caramelised orange, over a broad spicy herbal base. Dominant orange hop flavours, much like the aromas. Sharp, but short hit of bitterness that is replaced by a dull, carboardy crystal malt tone.Very drying and possibly a little over carbonated.
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Treacle / dark orange appearance. Sweet pineapple aromas. Good bitter sweet balance. Consistant frothy head and bubbles with a medium body. I personally didn’t think it was bitter enough for an IPA, but a great bevvy anyways.
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Quite possibly the best beer currently available from this brewer, which isn’t to say much. Pours a bright browning copper with minimal islands of froth and little legs. Surprisingly good, big herbal and flowery New Zealand hop nose with licks of butter, cocoa and cola soda. Similar hop presence in the mouth with pronounced Munich and crystal-style malts that give it a biscuity sweetness with just a touch of ginger for depth. Malt is swallowed up as it moves backwards by some firm, fresh earthy hops that show just a little too softly bitter a swallow. Light crystal malt sweetness lingers. The body is exceptionally light and the artificial carbonation is a little annoying, yet this is quite a decent quaffer. Not at all bad!!! (33cL, 07/11/06, Morley Liquor Merchants)
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);On tap at Warners in Christchurch. Nice, drak beer enjoyed on a cold day. Quite malty. Not my preferred style of beer, but this was decent.
Mac's Copperhop Ale;Auckland, New Zealand;IPA;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours a nice amber with a small white head. Armoa is very hoppy and spicy. The beer is very aggesivly hopped, and has a fairly sweet malt palate that balances quite well. This finish is also quite bitter and rough. Great for the price, I can see this going a long way in the Australian market.
Big Buck Black n Berry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout;Big Buck Brewery;Red tinted brown with a nice head. malt aroma. leaves lacing down glass. flavor is chocolate toffee with a citrus hop finish
Big Buck Black n Berry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at Grapevine Texas location. First off a disclaimer, this is more akin to a fruit beer than a stout and I rated it a such. Nearly opaque with a reddish bottom. Small off-white head and some lacing, thin ot medium-bodied. Porter (not stout) aroma of roasted malt, strong coffee, bittersweet chocolate and smoky hints. The fruity raspberry is an complementary undertone. Very nice. Good smoky and sweet malt balance with the tart and fruity raspberry, wow, well thought out. Dry and lively mouthfeel, tart finish. A great hybrid, workes well together. I'm completely against the grain on this one, I really liked it. A love it or hate it beer.
Big Buck Black n Berry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout;Big Buck Brewery;Quite possibly the worst idea anyone ever had for something to do to beer. Seriously. An evil genius lay awake in his own sweat for nights dreaming up this concoction. For a few delerious, feverish moments I imagined a decent German desert of some sort, but then I woke up and realized that I was drinking sewage.
Big Buck Black n Berry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout;Big Buck Brewery;Sampled draught at Big Buck, Grapevine, Texas. Dark brown. Sweet artificial raspberry aroma. Lightly roasty, stiky and with candyish berry flavour. Watery finish.
Big Buck Black n Berry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout;Big Buck Brewery;A pointless fusion of one good beer with one bad beer, proving that not everything is the sum of its parts. With this mix, you lose the palate and finish of the stout in exchange for only a slight gain in fruitiness at the front. Not a fair trade. (on tap, Grapevine, TX location)
Big Buck Black n Berry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout;Big Buck Brewery;Weak head and weak lace, low carbination. The touch of raspberry with the bitterness of coffee was okay, but not great. This would go well with a nice cheese cake or chocolate dessert.
Big Buck Black n Berry;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Stout;Big Buck Brewery;This beer is allegedly a combination of the stout and the raspberry wheat. Interesting....the stout wasnt stout enough to begin with so this beer wasnt all that it could have been. Very pretty color, mohogany. Dark berry taste and finish.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;On tap. Orange in color and hzy with a small white head. Aroma is of banana, clove and lemon. Taste is of yeast, banana, and spice.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Best beer of the lineup. Golden orange color, hazy, and a thin head. Very banana and clove in the smell. Taste is banana, spices, wheat, and malts.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Had at he Big Buck in Auburn Hills in 2005. Served with lemon, had a cloudy colour as expected. Slightly bitter, average overall for a Hefe-Weizen in the US.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Poured from tap in Grapevine, TX. This pour produced a beer with a cloudy pale yellow body and very little head which diminished fully by the time the glass was brought to me. There was no need for a lemon with this brew as the aroma carried strong notes of lemon and wheat. I had to let the beer mature to bring out the notes of clove described by the brewery, and could not detect banana. This was a full-flavored, tart, crisp, and wheat-flavored brew, well in line for a Hefeweizen. I was very pleased with this beer and will enjoy it again when I have a chance.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at the Gaylord, MI location. Basic, but tasty, hefeweizen, pouring a cloudy yellow-orange topped by a thick off-white head. Characteristic clove-banana ester notes paired with light bready, tangy wheat. They’re a dime a dozen, but hefeweizens are great for humid summer nights.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Draught at the brewpub, Heatwave Hefe-Weizen Cloudy blonde-orange color. It’s served with a slice of lemon, therefore the aroma has a mix of lemon and banana. Medium body, with a residual sweetness, a light banana taste, some spiceness and a final strong bitterness (for a Hefe-Weizen).
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Grapevine location, on tap. Excellent Hefe, great look, amazing flavor of some citrus (lemon) and banana. Nice head, cloudy deep yellow pour. One of my Big Buck favorites, and the same for a few other aficionados at the bar.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Tap @ Brewpub with Nuffield. Rating from 2004 notes. Cloudy yellow color with note head. An off aroma and flavor with a touch of orange and citrus.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at the brewery in Gaylord Michigan. <!-- p --> Yellow, hazy with no head. The nose is mostly grains. Taste is full of bannannas grains and yeast. Of the beers that they had this is among the best.
Big Buck Hefe-Weizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Pour is light yellow and hazey...almost like a witbier...smell is bubblegum and bananas....taste is spicy and lots of wheat and malty flavors....strange slightly sour finish...
Big Buck Dunkelweizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Meh. Really was not a fan. Glad that I sampled it because it was pretty unique, but would pass on it in the future.
Big Buck Dunkelweizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Big Buck Brewery;On tap: Real sweet aroma with banana and spice. Dark brown with reddish-orange hilights when held to the light. Off-white head. Sweet up front and finishes with a sour nutty hop flavor and a slight burn.
Big Buck Dunkelweizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Tap: Dark brown in color not enough head for a dunkel( probably the pour). Strong ripe banana aroma. Even stronger banana finish with only a hint of spice/clove. Almost no sweet malt aroma or taste. Not a true dunkel but a decent beer nonetheless.
Big Buck Dunkelweizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Sweet malty aroma. Dark brownish color. Sweet maltyflavor with some of the weizen. Very good beer. I usually don't like dunkelweizen as much as regular weizen but the guys at this Big Buck location (Grapevine, TX) figured out how to get past the usual dunkelweizen boringness and create something good.
Big Buck Dunkelweizen;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Big Buck Brewery;Gorgeous reddish brown color. Thin head. Subtlely sweet malt flavor that went down smooth, not a whole lot to it, but it still kicked ass.
Big Buck Cervesa Trienta;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Buck Brewery;Like a Corona with a pulse and a little bitterness in the finish, not bad, but still a weak beer.

Loscher Münchsteinacher Zwickel Pils;Münchsteinach, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Loscher;Bottle from the brewery getränkemarkt. Pours hazy gold with a tall-building and lasting white head. There’s some chunky yeast globules in the bottom of the bottle that don’t make it into the first pour but on subsequent pours it does turn the experience quite doughy and muddled. Without that, it’s enjoyably hoppy in the aroma, the yeast imparts a musty minerality, and the malt is simple but pleasant baked bread and crackers. Lightly sweet to off-dry with snappy bitterness and some juicy yeast acidity. Decently full mouth feel and lots of froth from the high carbonation, and while the finish is bitter and well-matched and pleasant, the whole effect isn’t all that special. Seems to be well-made, in decent shape, and benefiting from the yeast more than hurt by it.

Tou Sommerøl;Oslo, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);Bottled. Pale golden. Fruity, but fairly crisp. Traces of pine needles. Low bitterness. Simple, but well balanced.
Tou Sommerøl;Oslo, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ringnes Bryggeri (Ringnes - Carlsberg);"The commercial description is right about one thing: The flavour is like air, i.e. equally tasteless! Brewed by Tou Bryggeri (now part of the Ringnes group) in my home town Stavanger (I'm ashamed), this beer is one of the summer specials that all Norwegian breweries have been spitting out the last 10 years or so. An utterly meaningless effort: Their standard pilseners (that otherwise dominate the market) are summer beers good enough. I hardly think anyone asked them for a change. But of course, as the American macro brewers always have known: Minimum malts + minimum hops + maximum water = maximum profits. And the unconscious public buy this shit: Named a ""summer"" brew, people think they're supposed to drink it once air temperature rises above +15 degrees Celsius. No colour (actually slightly hazy), just a little initial aroma, no flavour (well, at least the flavour isn't foul - it just isn't there), no aftertaste. Bad, bad, bad!"

Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy yellow gold pour with a white head. Moderately hoppy taste and aroma with a dry, mildly bitter finish. Solid IPA.
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;From notes: On tap at the brewery it is a clear golden color with a citrus aroma. The taste is grapefruit.
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;On draft at the brewery. Pours a clear copper with an off white head. Fruity nose. Flavors of citrus and resin, with a dash of salt. Smooth, moderately bitter finish.
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;Standard IPa. Highlights the hop bite. Pretty balanced here, but unexciting. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;Draft. Poured hazy copper color with an average frothy off-white head that lasted with fair lacing. Moderate sour citrus hop aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate bittersweet flavor with a moderate bittersweet finish of medium duration. Good brew.
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;tap at the Gaylord location - Pours copper-gold with an off-white head. There’s a mild citrus hop aroma. The flavor has strong bitterness backed by a good medium bodied malt profile. The expected long bitter finish is there too. It’s fairly good. It doesn’t stand out for IPAs, but it’s works alright.
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;Have bought growlers of this because it was so fresh. Decent IPA with hops in both aroma and taste. Medium body and head. Amber color.
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;Pretty dark color for an IPA, hoppy nose/aroma as expected. Decently hoppy flavored, a bit of malt present. Probably my favorite beer that I have tried at Big Buck.
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;(From a 5 Liter mini-keg brought back from Michigan for me) Nice pine hop aroma, pours a cloudy brown/amber, with a big fluffy white head. Wow... great hop character, with just enough malts to balance it out. Nice long pine hop finish, a bit of thickness to the mouthfeel. I wish I could get this around me on a regular basis.
Big Buck IPA;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;IPA;Big Buck Brewery;On tap at brewery. Aroma is floral, grassy, citrus hopps. Murky apple cider in appearance. Starts sweet and finishes bitter. Med/full bodied. Good aroma but just something a little off on the palate and flavor.
Northampton Weizenheimer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);4oz pour at the brewpub. Pours amber with an off-white head. Aroma of light wheat, pale and caramel malts, hints of spices, and some dough. Flavor the same. Average texture. Not my favorite beer of the style.
Northampton Weizenheimer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);Appearance: cloudy haze of liquefied white breads, crusts included for some color. Bubbly feeble head. Nose: doughy bready with bananas and a ghost of lemon. Predominantly chewy breads with another ghostly presence of crust for some crunch. Palate: unusual and not particularly pleasant spritzy mouthfeel with lemon bubblies. Bakery fresh breads with watery lemon essence. Banana phenolics disappear as fast as they appear. Final Thoughts: the nose didn’t leave me with much hope for the palate which was about what I expected. Far too thin, watery, and the seltzeresque mouthfeel wasn’t pleasant at all. Wheat beers should be creamy, smooth, and soft on the mouth. My least favorite of the beers I drank during my many visits to Northampton Brewery.
Northampton Weizenheimer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);Sour ciruts on palate, gritty uneven wheat flavors, something when kinda wrong in a bad direction. It’s pretty bad unfortunately
Northampton Weizenheimer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);The beer poured clear yellow with a note of fruit and spice on the nose. The palate showed some deeper notes of fruits but it had a very sharp bittrness on the finish.
Northampton Weizenheimer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);Shared a sampler that had this in it. It had a Miller or Bud appearance with a Miller or Bud taste.
Northampton Weizenheimer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);Tap at the brewery. Pale golden beer, thin white head. Light citrusy aroma, lemon, wheaty spice, some faint appley esters, but generall pretty clean. Marshmallowy flavour along with the standard fruit esters. Light citrus hop flavour, low bitterness. Thin bodied, soft testure. Decent summer beer but nothing really amazing either.
Northampton Weizenheimer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);This was not undrinkable, but definitely NOT a wheat. Acted more like a relatively vanilla american microbrewed lager, this beer smelled of, well, not wheat. uninspired offering.
Northampton Weizenheimer;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Wheat Ale;Northampton Brewery (MA);On tap at the brewpub. Clear light copper color. It had a nicely fizzy mouthfeel with a mild bitterness at the end.

Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);Excellent style. The Valley's original brewpub. It's best to hang out on their deck on a nice day. The inside bar is nice if you can find a spot. The food is average at best. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);On tap at Northampton Brewery on 19 April 2010. Definitely a ruby porter rather than a big roasty number. Good condition. Big malty aroma - a little smoky. Some hops on the palate. A little sweet though. Not the best of the Northampton beers for me.
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);Loved the dynamic this porter presented. Quite possibly one of the best I have sampled. Not too heavy, with a hop presence that was just enough.
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);The porter pours deep brown with a nice head. It shows notes of chocolate and toasted malt on both the nose and the palate. It does drink quite smooth and the finish is nice and long.
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);On-tap at the brewpub. Black, with lace. Some bitterness, above average carbonation, creamy mouthfeel.
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);Shared a sampled that had this in it. It had a nice dark brown color and a nice chocolate aroma, but it was watery.
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);tap at the brewery. Dark brew with a thich light brown head. Light toasty aroma, cherry fruitiness. A little lacking on dark malt flavours. Some toast and light coffee. Low bitterness but a touch of piny/resiny hop flavour. Some nuttiness as it warms. Pretty bland in general though.
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);On tap at Noho brewing. Very dark brown. I found it to be a little on the watery side with an inoffensively mild taste.
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);Faint traces of head don’t last over the coke colored pour. Smoky roastiness contains a tartish backbone in the form of peaches and green grapes. Vinous apple-like tart character fights it off with the potently roasted malts. Very light bodied, fair carbonation.
Northampton Hoovers Porter;Northampton, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Northampton Brewery (MA);On tap at the brewpub. Dark red in color with a white head. Malty aroma. Chocolate notes. Chocolate malty flavor. Thin palate.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Weizen;Tokyo, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ishikawa Brewery;My Bottom Line: Full-on banana esters eventually let cloves through before light citrus seals this chewy Weizen. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam surrounds the cloudy beige. -This is not as intensely carbonated as most bottled Weizens, so don’t expect the same fluffy mouthfeel. -The flavor profile is pretty much what you expect from the style. -Wheat flavors aren’t as well defined as in my favorite examples of the style. On tap at Standing Beer Bar 1020.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Weizen;Tokyo, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ishikawa Brewery;Bottle bought at the brewery. Hazy golden with a small white head. Banana, some citric aromas as well. Flavours are more spiced, providing a dry finish after the banana impact. Borderline infection case.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Weizen;Tokyo, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ishikawa Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Bright yellow, opaque with a medium head. Funky yeast aroma again! With bananas and clove. Creamy and sweet—banana cream pie! Thick, creamy body. Yeast presence is annoying. Buttery, with a tiny rancid-like note. Ok, but a little too funky.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Weizen;Tokyo, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ishikawa Brewery;A slightly sour-ish weizen. Again, the same undecipherable Japanese hieriglyphics on the label. No matter. The taste speaks for itself in any language. A very nice, wheaty, true-to-style weizen that is a pleasure to drink. Thanks Mark (MRomero548) for sending me all these quality Japanese brews!
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Helles;Tokyo, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Ishikawa Brewery;瓶内発酵ビール 色濃いけど味はそんなにこくない
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Helles;Tokyo, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Ishikawa Brewery;Draught at 1020. Deep golden color with a fine head. Malty nose, bread, oranges, light hop but it comes thru nicely. Bready, malty flavor, rich and thick, smooth, with low bitterness but nice citrus accent from the hops. Nicely enough done, a bit plain but good malt character. Very fruity. Needs more bitterness to shine.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Helles;Tokyo, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Ishikawa Brewery;This one's a bit of a dud, though perhaps it's just that I'm not much of a fan of the helles style. A tad overcarbonated and metallic. Weird aftertaste.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Helles;Tokyo, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Ishikawa Brewery;Hints of grape? Hmm. Not bad. A little too carbonated for my taste. Pleasant though.
Amherst Boltwood Bock;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Amherst Brewing Company;Has a hazy golden color with a small white head. Smell is of light hops. Taste was also of light malts and finished with a light hop bitterness. Overall I was disappointed with the beer as I like the heavier/thicker bocks
Amherst Boltwood Bock;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Amherst Brewing Company;Hazy golden orange, whitish sticky head. Fruity nose. All malts, apples, weird metal hints, light to medium bodied. Finishes with small hop bitterness. This is nothing special, Im not very impressed, although it is very drinkable.
Amherst Boltwood Bock;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Amherst Brewing Company;Pours a hazy orange with a nice head. Nice, but weak malt aroma. Hearty malt taste, that lingers and is very refreshing.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;Slightly hazy, amber, medium head. Aroma shows some pedio, light English yeast. Sweet, amber malts, a touch biscuity, the pedio isn’t showing through much.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;Bottle. Quite caramel-forward with some grassy hops, feels a bit more British, not horrible but fairly boring. Probably at the top-end of the omiyage beer range but that is still fairly uninspiring...
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;Bottle. Amber pour with a thick white head. Grape, banana, tropical fruit, bread, perfume. Light and silky body with nice and balanced carbonation. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;Bottle. Thanks to Bart. Fresh, grassy aromas with some diacetyl notes. Golden yellow color. Mild maltiness, finish is a touch sweet. Medium body. Not bad at all.... but doesn’t really stand out in any way.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;Bottle at home bought at Hanadaya. Golden amber coloured, slightly hazy with small beige head. Aroma is fruity, citrus and grassy hops, and also a bit sweet. Taste is fruity but without as much sweetness. End is lemony bitter, but not forcefully so. Quite subtle and pretty nice. Not bad at all.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;Tap. Soft caramel and skunk nose. Soft and delicate. Nice low bitter finish. Very drinkable, if a tad nonchalant.

Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;Bottle from the brewery, 5.5% ABV. Hazy amber, medium white head. Good fruity toffee, both in the mouth and in the nose. Good balance between toffee and fruity hop bitterness.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;"On tap at the brewery. Medium copper color. Flowery, slightly perfumey aroma, with citrus, hops, fruits. Hoppy, fruity, light flavor. Slightly alcoholic!; with honey. Popcicle like. Ok. It might be good if it weren’t so cold. Rather bland, though."
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pale Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;Deep golden color, eggshell white head, nice hoppy taste and again, a nice feel, rather creamy. Well done! I could drink way too much of this!
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pilsner;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ishikawa Brewery;Tap the brewery. Clear blond. Big white head. Aroma is wheaty, touch of citrus hoppiness.

Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pilsner;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ishikawa Brewery;Super soft pils. Piss straw colour. Light hoppiness. Smooth easy drinking. Bready body.

Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pilsner;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ishikawa Brewery;Light gold with a hint of green, similar to a Chardonnay. Foamy white head, grassy perfumy scent. A bit thin, mild flavor of grain and a slight lingering bitterness.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pilsner;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ishikawa Brewery;Medium white head. Pale yellow body with carbonation. Light flour and floral hop aroma, very harmonic. Taste is flour, floral clean hops and some rubber. Dry, rubbery aftertaste. Some spice. Normal pilsener, with a decent hop aroma. (0.3l on tap.)
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Pilsner;Tokyo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ishikawa Brewery;Light yellow color. Pleasant, mild fruit tastes. Seems to go flat quickly...
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Munchener Dark;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ishikawa Brewery;Tap at the brewery. Dark brown colour, big gold head. Aroma is caramel, quite sweet, nice dark maltiness, bit of chocolate and something sharp. Taste is also initially sharp then settles down. Caramel sweetness, bit of chocolate milk, maybe kahlua. Nice enough.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Munchener Dark;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ishikawa Brewery;Bottle from the brewery. Dark brown with a small, tan head. Milky, roasted malts aroma. Rich capuccino flavours with hints of chocolate. Good, though on the sweet side.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Munchener Dark;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ishikawa Brewery;Served icy cold at the brewery. Tried to wait for it to warm up... Medium brown color. Yeasty aroma, with some caramel. Caramel flavor, with bitter hops, funky yeast. Slightly metallic, which chocolate. Ok malt—but this yeast overpowers it. Not too interesting. Disappointing.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Munchener Dark;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ishikawa Brewery;Biggish creamy beige head. Amber body. Meaty roasty coffee and caramel aroma. Sweet roasty caramel and coffee taste with grainy notes. Dry grainy aftertaste. A nice dunkel. (0.3l on tap.)
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Munchener Dark;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ishikawa Brewery;Dark brown color. Sweet chcololate malt nose. Smooth, chocolately mouth, with hints of cherry cheescake and faint apples and oranges. Decent chocolatey malt finish. Nice. All these beers are much nicer on tap than in a bottle.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Munchener Dark;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ishikawa Brewery;A medium Brown color with a small beige head. Nose is sweet malts with nutty/woody notes in the background. Slight malty sweetness with a lactic acid tartness to it. Follow is a bit tart, this seems to be the Japanese style for Dunkels. I’ve had several that have this odd acidic tartness to them.
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Munchener Dark;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ishikawa Brewery;"Since the label says ""Munchener Dark"", perhaps this is a munich dunkel - I hear the Japanese are crazy about ""black beers"". This is above-average but tastes a little lacking in malt. This reminds me of Kostritzer Schwarzbier in its thinness. Good; not great."
Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Munchener Dark;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Ishikawa Brewery;I called this a brown ale originally rather than a stout or schwarzbier. Similar to other Japanese dark beers like Asahi Black. A little sweet. Overall, a good beer.
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Pale clear yellow pour, with a fizzy white head. Grain, corn, grassy, and watery. Light and non offensive. Not bad for an NA.
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Aroma: metallic like aluminium, little weet and malty Appearance: golden, clear, minimal head, white foam disappears quickly Taste: Sweet, metallic Palate: light body, thin feel, lively carbonation,
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Aroma is hay and grass. A bit of a yeastiness came out as it warmed. Rather muted. Clear yellow with golden depth and a full white head that faces quickly to a collar. Taste is hay, with moderate bitterness. Some aspects of smoothness in the back. An off lemon-polish aspect at the death. Certainly, there are worse NAs than this. [p.s. - raising the score a bit as I had a couple more of these as my brother left a twelve pack and they are sitting around. There is a rounded flavor to this and it lacks many of the harsh characteristics of many NAs and even cheap lagers. Have to say, his text to me that it is the first NA that taste like the real one scared me a bit.] [p.p.s.....may I never re-rate another non-alc in my life!]
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Can. Brilliantly clear straw yellow. Tall white foamy headstand. Aroma of hay, corn, grass, grain. Flavor is corn, grass, cardboard, grains. Low bitterness. Light bodied. For what it is, it’s not bad. Not great by any means but not bad either.
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;I am rating this beer in comparison to what’s available not compared to alcoholic beer. Pours a light clear gold color with big head that settled down quickly to a minimal head. Aroma is of yeast and light malts. Taste follows the aroma and has a light mouth feel. Taste slightly sweet . very similar to Pabst Blue ribbon without a slight alcohol smoothness and taste. If you wouldn’t know it you might not no its none alcoholic beer.
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;can @ Party Town / Florence KY --- Clear light-medium amber, ivory head that shrinks to a cover, waves of lace. Taste is mild malt, light carbonation, and minimal hops. Actually quite drinkable as an NA,, but well short of traditional brews.
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Straight outa the can, ’cause that’s the way you do it. Yellow, fizzy, taste of corn and aluminum.
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Poured from a can into a pint glass. This beer is a very thin yellow color with a small white head. It has almost no aroma. The taste is actually not bad for a non-alcoholic brew, it has a faint beer flavor and it doesn’t have that often characteristic bad aftertaste Overall: this brew certainly would work for someone who is the designated driver and it is much better than O’Doul’s and Coors N/A.
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;12oz can, thanks to Chudwick. Date on bottom of the can reads Dec 08 14. Wow, I dig that there’s actually a legible date under this thing. Clear pale golden color, with some bigger bubbles on the side of the glass. Bigger airy white head upon pouring, that audibly fizzes away to a respectable thin (albeit bubbly and airy) amount, leaving some splotches of lace. Big bready burnt popcorn aroma that I’m beginning to associate with these NAs. What is that about? Just an intense, rough corn flavor that doesn’t ferment out? Definitely seeing a pattern, here. Moderate sweet taste, light bitter, and a sort of rough spicy bite. Seems to have a better doughy malt profile than other NAs I’ve recently tasted, though. Medium body, sort of slick, with a rough texture to it. Sort of soft, lighter carbonation. Leaves a sort of dry roughness on my teeth. Overall, disappointing and bad in the way most macro NAs are. I think I like this one slightly better than most, it’s not 100% repulsive. Maybe it’s fresher? Got to love the date codes.
Old Milwaukee NA;Los Angeles, California, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pabst Brewing Company;Pours a clear yellow with a thick and frothy eggshell head. Average, but acceptable. Aroma is barely noticeable, malty and a bit fruity, not at all impressive. Malty flavor seems watered down - might as well be water with a little beer mixed in. Texture is watery and barely fizzy. Well, I had to try it. Nein danke - gimme a Sweetwater.

Hog Blonde;Levin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Loaded Hog Brewery;Bright gold in colour with smll white head, sulphur and hops bitterness. Caramel malt aroma. Just average.
Hog Blonde;Levin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Loaded Hog Brewery;Slightly hazy, pale golden colour, thin white head. Low to no aroma. Pretty standard attempt at a macro beer. Flavour is a little rough around the edges, grassy hops with a bit of a stale cheesey component as well. Bad.
Hog Blonde;Levin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Loaded Hog Brewery;"Hog Blonde is a nice simple beer that makes deceptively easy drinking. While it doesn't present the punchier qualities expected in a pilsener, it's still a good drop. Pours lightly hazy pale straw with very small head. Low/medium carbonation. There's a strong ""fields of wheat"" and cut grass aroma with a mellow fresh malt fruitiness. An inviting combo. The taste is fresh'n'fruity with mild clover honey but is rather less impressive than the aroma. There's not enough hops used here. The mouthfeel is smooth, not very zingy, but still with a nice creaminess. There's not too much aftertaste and again, not very bitter. What you get is a hit of malt sweetness with a distant dryness and the mearest hint of bitterness. Smooth and fresh in the mouth, and still refreshing, this makes a good quaffer on a mild day. A mellow beer for a mellow mood, or social gathering, I could drink a lot of this. Great with brunch, antipasto or a sandwich with mustard in it. Serve cold."
Hog Blonde;Levin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Loaded Hog Brewery;after starting new years eve in christchurch with some dux de lux beers, this was quite a comedown. this beer tasted to me entirely of lemonade with some onion thrown in. thin alright
Hog Blonde;Levin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Loaded Hog Brewery;this is my new least favourite beer. it tastes precisely like melted down icecubes. small amount of saazy bitterness struggles to get above the freezer matured taste. yellow and doesnt keep a head. a complete disgrace, even worse than outback.
Hog Blonde;Levin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Loaded Hog Brewery;Very pale yellow with a rockiness in the head that presents well initially. The appearance is not great at first as there are many lemonadey type bubbles that eventually give way to the preferred beading. The nose has a definite hint of hop that could promise a bit more. The taste suggests that they have borrowed a small cupfull of hops from the Czechs (as opposed to the claim that they stole this from them and improved on it). There is a hint of butter that detracts from the necessary clean finish expected of a pisener.
Hog Blonde;Levin, New Zealand;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Loaded Hog Brewery;A rather mediocre continental-style pils. Straw coloured, slight bitterness to start, with a sweet maltiness to follow.

Dansk Mjød Vikingernes Mjød;Billund, Denmark;Mead;Dansk Mjød;Pretty good stuff. Sweet and strong. Aroma is honey, brandy, oak, tobacco.

Master Choice De-Alcoholised Ice Beer;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);I bought this because my wife is pregnant and on a killer hot day I thought it would be nice if we could share a beer. Really, this is bad, but not disgustingly bad. I would rate it fairly high for non-alc beers, but in general, it has to be rated poorly. It has an over-sweet aroma. It looks like generis pap. The flaour wasn't horrible, but only vaguely beer-like. No aftertaste.

Smiles Bristol IPA;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);I just had it last night. It was a little sweet in smell, but bitter in taste. The colour is interesting, and cloudy before settling. Strange beer.
Smiles Bristol IPA;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Cask at County Hotel (JDW) Ashford. Amber in colour, some perfumed hops on nose. Acidic in mouth and on end. Bit ordinary until you get a smack of tangy hops on the end.

Bright yellow/orange with a foamy top. Caramel mainly, with a some slight pepper dryness. Fairly bitter, but not interesting enough and nothing like an IPA.

Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;On tap at Newark brewpub. Poured a dark honey brown amber color with a creamy two finger off white foamy head and nice lacing. The aroma was plain and simple, toasted malts, a touch of sweet caramel, and a lite hoppiness. The taste followed the aroma, which started off malty with toastiness and sugary caramel. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Very middle of the road, a sessional beer.
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;20100926 tap at Wilmington. Dark cola brown with sheeting beige head of even medium foam. Aroma is full of burnt vegetal notes, tar, burnt toast, and some floral hints as it warms. Flavor is primarily toasty malts with dark bread, walnut, mint, pine. Interesting, tasty,clean. Yum.
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;(cask @ GBBF). A nice meaty, chocolty ,roasty SChwarz amid all those alcoholic US beers , i though this was a decent take on a style I like. A bit minty hopped and chalky in the finish . Not bad rendition.
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;GABF 09. Pours a deep clear woody brown almost black- nice light beige head. Aroma is nutty, herbal, modest roast, choocolate and coffee, some black malt acrid- and burnt notes, toffee and light sweetness. Flavor is full bready toasted malt, then some nice herbal floral hops to balance and a modest sweetness, and just hints of roast and chocolate- Clean and easy drinking will more flavor than 4.4% would lead you to believe. Nice.
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;I liked this very much. Very nice creamy head that lasted til the end. Dark amber pour with a fruity malty aroma. Nice malty sweet taste with a hop finish. Dry at the end. Very good.
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;"On tap at GABF 2009. Dark brown in color with reddish hues and a small tan head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is well-balanced with roast, coffee, and grassy hops. Flavor is roasted malt, coffee, nuts, and crisp grassy hops. Described as a ""black pilsner,"" but it’s roastier than others of that style that I’ve tried. Palate is clean and crisp with medium-light body and average carbonation. Overall a very good schwarzbier."
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;10/2/09 notes: GABF Saturday. Nice toasty, ash chocolate nose, with dry, somewhat grassy and chocolatey body. Very flavorful for the style. Palate is clean, without being watery. Enjoyable.
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;Draught at BrewPub: Aroma of roasted malts, light chocolate, light coffee, and a hint of wood. Poured very dark brown/very deep amber in color with a small, creamy, tan head, that lasted throughout. Clear. Not sparkling. Good lacing. Flavor is lightly sweet. Tastes of roasted malts, light chocolate, light bitter coffee, slight wood, and a hint of nuts. Medium body. Dry, lightly chalky texture. Soft to average carbonation. Roasted malt, chocolate finish is chalky and dry. I initially mistook this for the Pig Iron Porter, but upon comparing the two, the lager characteristics of the Schwarz were very clear. Earlier Rating: 11/2/2003 Total Score: 2.2 Not as good as the porter from which it is derived. Not enough taste, though quite dry.
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;On tap at Iron Hill Lancaster...I hope this is the same beer...was just listed on the specialty beer menu as Schwarzbier...poured root-beer in color, off-white head...light roasty aroma with caramel, malts...flavor was somewhat light but malty, with molassas, walnut, weak coffee...not a bad beer...went down fast.
Iron Hill Czech Dark Lager (Schwarz);Newark, Delaware, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Iron Hill Newark;(11/8/08) Draught sample at the brewpub in North Wales. Clear reddish-amber color. Weak aroma of malt and light toastiness. Sweetish flavor with some caramel. Light-bodied.
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;I initially had this in Queenstown in 2005, but that location has now closed. Apparently Aukland has closed as well? The website seems to promote only Wellington and Christchurch locations. Anyway, it doesn’t matter all that much, as the beers were not very good. This was served with rather low carbonation and was very cold. A low apple-fruit aroma with a hint of caramel malt led the way, and the flavour was pretty much the same. Thin and minimally carbonated.
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;Dark black in colour with thin white head. Biscut and malt aroma. Thin watery body with hint of burt coffee. Dry finish.
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;On tap at the Hog in Queenstown. Pours a clear dark brown with a small cappuchino head. Slightly sour with a twist of burnt malts and a hint of band aid. Thinnish and kind of watery with some oilyness. Low to medium carbonation.
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;Not a beer I would ever go back for seconds. It smelt like a turd covered in burnt hair and tasted like a shot of coffee in a pint of coke. The shame.
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;Draught at Loaded Hog, Auckland. So, with 5999 Ratebeer ratings in my luggage I walked in to this brewpub, aiming to find a beer worthy to celebrate 6000 with. I knew it wouldn’t be great the second Iopened the door. To get to the bar I had to wade across the dance floor where drunk middle aged couples were falling around to the sound of the lousiest cover band north of the Antartica, with a noise level that could wake up the dead. Luckily I managed to make it to the bar without my feet getting stuck on the messy floor, and somehow managed to get the bartenders attention through pointing at two beer taps. The beer came out dark brown with near no head. It had an appley nose and uit was appley, sweetish and thin. The mouthfeel was sharp and clean, and I could sense no hops. Why, oh why did I pick this, the lousiest brewpub in the southern hemisphere to have my 6000th rating?
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;Dark brown-orange colour. Slightly vegetal aroma. Faint maltiness, and a touch of nuttiness. Flavour is quite non-descript, faint malt and herbs. Light toasty finish, but way to thin-bodied to be any good.
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;"Tasted 15/07/2005. 400ml tumbler’s (the old Tupelo ""bookie"" glass) from Loaded Hog, Wellington. Calls itself full-bodied but tastes like a shot of espresso in a pint of sparkling mineral water. It’s fresh, the pipes are clean, the glass is clean-ish and it goes down easy while you’re having a chat with friends but I’d never choose to drink here myself. And, it’s a lager."
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;pretty terrible beer from a terrible beer franchise. sickly sweet with the only other flavours being compost and vegetable stock
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;maybe this was too cold but it was heinously sweet. tasted like a malzbier - raw malt extract, brown sugar and water. plenty of water.
Hog Dark Ale;Levin, New Zealand;Brown Ale;Loaded Hog Brewery;I only asked for a half pint but was served the full one. By the looks of this amber/copper ale and the creme caramel head I think this mignt not have been a bad thing. The nose is a cross between coffee and toffee in the place of any aroma of hops. The flavour is rich and suitably mouthfilling with an obvious hit of crystal malt and burnt black malt character. Like a lot of these styles the bitterness is not so much provided by the hops as the malt. A good beer that is served too cold.
Hog Draft Beer;Levin, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Loaded Hog Brewery;Bright red in colour with thin white head. Interesting candy floss ad honey flavours. crisp clean finish. Interesting style.
Hog Draft Beer;Levin, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Loaded Hog Brewery;"Hazy orange-amber beer with mossy shine; small whitish head. Diacetyl, butterscotch, buttertoffees!! Less diacetyl in the taste, but still enough - as with the water. Bit of old, oily hazelnuts. Even a bit end-sourishness. Very ligfht body, only the buttery diacetyl filling in to a very slick feel. Oh well, interesting enough to have this rare thing. Thanks, Stef!"
Hog Draft Beer;Levin, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Loaded Hog Brewery;There is no incentive whatsoever to have a second one of these, in fact after tasting some of the others out of this range I was similarly disappointed. It looks inviting enough but tastes like the stainless steel it was brewed in. It seems like the product of the manufactured franchise that I drank it in, so at least that’s a good fit.
Hog Draft Beer;Levin, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Loaded Hog Brewery;Rich golden colour. Fairly sweet toffeeish aroma. Flavour is also quite malty, toffee, caramel, honey with a touch of spiciness. Their best beer, but that’s not saying all that much.
Hog Draft Beer;Levin, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Loaded Hog Brewery;"Tasted 15/07/2005. 400ml tumbler (the old Tupelo ""bookie"" glass) from Loaded Hog, Wellington. Another bantamweight from the Loaded Hog. I must confess there is nothing bad going on with these beers but, most importantly, there doesn’t appear to be an attempt to actually make anything with any character - and that’s worse in my book. As a money making venture, these guys are probably killing it ($1 litre to make, $12+ over the bar). This one has more going on than the others - I can taste an unpleasant caramelised sugar - but other than that it’s basically the same old blandness. Ale my ass."
Hog Draft Beer;Levin, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Loaded Hog Brewery;after a couple of awful beers at the christchurch loaded hog franchise, i resolved to avoid the rest of them. a couple of days later i ended up tasting the loaded hog wheat and made this resolution again. another day later i ended up in a loaded hog franchise in hamilton and the cricket was on and i drank this and barely noticed it as steve waugh slog-swept his way to retirement. typical nutty nz lager with some bonus nasty aluminium flavour
Hog Draft Beer;Levin, New Zealand;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Loaded Hog Brewery;Dark golden colour. Buttery malt aroma. Flavour is rather mediocre. .....
Hog Gold Lager;Levin, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Loaded Hog Brewery;Gold straw colour with thin white head. Weak malt aroma. Thin body and very watery mouthfeel.
Hog Gold Lager;Levin, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Loaded Hog Brewery;I dared myself to try this beer just to see if the Loaded Hog set of franchises had any redeeming features. I shouldn’t have bothered.
Hog Gold Lager;Levin, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Loaded Hog Brewery;Clear, pale golden beer with a thin white head. Pale malt aroma, some hay and bread. Flavour of bread and crackers. Light spicy/grassy hops. Decently quaffable, and it doesn’t have any faults, but its nothing very interesting either.
Hog Gold Lager;Levin, New Zealand;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Loaded Hog Brewery;"Tasted 15/07/2005. 400ml tumbler (the old Tupelo ""bookie"" glass) from Loaded Hog, Wellington. Light gold with a pathetic looking head that vanishes quickly, possibly from embarrasment. Crisp, dry, watery... actually it’s pretty tasteless. A hint of bitterness but it’s too cold to tell if there’s anything else going on. Mouthfeel is beyond lightweight - let’s call this one bantamweight. The taxman is probably gettting more revenue out of this beer than the maltsters. One gets the felling it’s all about money..."

Pours a brown color with a thin ring of head and not a whole lot of lace. Nose and flavor are clove, banana bread, yeast, fruity malt, and light hops. Boozy and warming in the finish. Medium bodied.
Kulmbacher Eisbock;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Eisbock;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Pour une Eisbock, les 9,2 % pourraient paraître décevants. Mais cela est trompeur car la brasserie Kulmbacher a su tirer entièrement profit de ce titrage avec un alcool qui est juste bien présent pour donner force et caractère sans taper dur et ce titrage permet également de ne pas avoir besoin d'avoir une bière sursucrée ce qui est parfois nécessaire pour équilibrer l'alcool. L'amertume joue également très bien son rôle afin de conférer ce petit plus de fraîcheur qui n'est pas toujours présent pour le genre. Côté équilibre on est donc proche de la perfection. Du côté des arômes, on ne peut qu'apprécier une belle tension en bouche avec un cocktail riche et puissant sur le caramel, la prune, la banane, le caramel, le raisin, une pointe de chocolat et des épices. On retrouve cette alliance gourmande tout en étant de caractère sur l'attaque et la seconde bouche. L’arrière-bouche et le final sont plus épurés avec un alcool s'affirmant davantage mais qui couplée à l'amertume permet à la bière de conserver son équilibre tout en étant racée. Certains auront peut-être une préférence pour des Eisbock plus riches, tant en alcool, qu'en densité, personnellement je trouve qu'on y retrouve dans cette Kulmbacher tout l'esprit des Eisbocks tout en étant plus élancée.
Kulmbacher Eisbock;Kulmbach, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Eisbock;Kulmbacher Brauerei (Brau Holding Int. - Heineken);Flaska från hopt.se. Mörkbrunfärgad med ett beständigt smutsvitt skum. Dofter av russin, malt och karamell. Smakinslag av russin, ljus choklad, karamell, honung och färska fikon. Alkoholen döljs helt och hållet i smaken. Det här är gott.

McSorleys Irish Style Lager;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;On tap- Served a black color with a nice tan head that fades to some lacing. Aroma of malt with a trace of caramel. There is also a bit of coffee and nut in the background. Taste of malt, coffee and some bittersweet chocolate. There is a nice bitterness throughout and a dry finish. Medium body, crisp and smooth. Nice balance. Easy drinker, nice beer for the style. I think having this on tap at an Irish pub enhances the character of this beer.
McSorleys Irish Style Lager;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;"Draft at McSorleys, where I think this is what the ""light"" beer is. Deep clear amber pour with a lasting two finger off-white head. Caramel and cereal grain aroma with mild earthy hoppiness. The flavor is big on caramel, grain, and bready notes. A little herbal too, not bad. Medium-bodied and slightly crisp with soft carbonation. A reasonable but not excitig beer."

McSorleys Irish Style Lager;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Draft at McSorley’s (NYC).

There are some grassy hop notes and a slight green apple flavor to it, but not much else I can remember.

McSorleys Irish Style Lager;Los Angeles, California, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pabst Brewing Company;Light herbal hops, malty, and a touch of roasted notes lead this boring brew. Easy to drink all night long, though.

Tama no Megumi (Ishikawa) Bottle Conditioned Ale;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ishikawa Brewery;The nose is basically non-existent, and the beer looks murky, with an off-white head that faded quickly. Very high carbonation on the palate, making for a fairly crisp finish. The flavours that push through aren't very... Authentic. They seem artificial and not alluring in the slightest.

Hazy amber/strae color, thin head, and good lace. Caramel, honey, apples, peaches, and light spicy hopping. Thin-medium body, a bit soapy with the somewhat over-the-top bottle conditioning carbonation, slightly dry finish. Okay. The carbonation does interfere a bit.

Hair of the Frog Dortmunder;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hair of the Frog;"I'm not much of a style guy - ordinarily I could care less about how ""true"" a beer is to style and I hardly ever rate that way. But this beer gave me pause. It looks, tastes, and smells so much like an English pale that I had to ask the very friendly bartender if she'd poured me the right brew. She assured me and I have to say, it's one strange dortmunder!"
Hair of the Frog Deep Doppelbock;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Hair of the Frog;light very sweet caramel on the nose. Dark ruby burgundy with no head. sweet sweet caramell bockishness that finishes in an intense cherry sugary sweetness. very sweet example of the style
Hair of the Frog Deep Doppelbock;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Hair of the Frog;Bright dark brown color. Slightly sweet organic malty presence in the nose with a touch of light chocolate present. Body starts with a short malty sweetness and quickly moves to overriding piney hops. Not a great example, needs a thicker, more robust maltiness to stand up to the big boys of the style. Never noticed that alcohol presence now that I see what it is.
Hair of the Frog Deep Doppelbock;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Hair of the Frog;Weird. But I'd come to expect that at this point. The brewery is in a hot tub rental place, of all things, with a thick, humid, chlorine feel and a very fun crowd. Anyway, this is a strange, burnt belgian sugar of a bock.
Hair of the Frog Frogger Vienna;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Hair of the Frog;His dad, who was the chief brewer, recently suffered a fall, so the current brewer kind of has free rein and he is using it to full chaotic creative advantage. This thing has the grassiest, most awkwardly herbal hops I've ever tasted. Pure alfalfa and only a touch of sweet maltiness. Yikes. Maybe the bartender accidently switched the dortmunder and this ...
Hair of the Frog Lily Pad Pale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hair of the Frog;Hazy amber body. As hennes said it, this was a little weak on the hops. A little sweet. But, the atmosphere of the brewery is nice, so I guess that makes up for it, if only a little.

Hair of the Frog Cut River IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Hair of the Frog;Golden color. Citrusy hoppiness and a light fruitiness in the nose. Big chewy hops in the body with a touch of fruit. Finishes long and sticky with not enough malt to balance things.
Hair of the Frog Cut River IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Hair of the Frog;I have to say I was impressed with the tap room of this little brewery, with the beefcake bulldog, Jake running around to the fish tank in the wall. The beer was pretty good. Hazy amber color, mostly diminishing head. Quite a bit of apparent Cascade hops, but there''s never enough of those in my opinion. This brewery should start distributing, but from the comments of others, they may need to make consistency a priority before they do that.
Hair of the Frog Cut River IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Hair of the Frog;Hoppiest standard beer sold here. Decent amount of hops. ..................
Hair of the Frog Cut River IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Hair of the Frog;Now we're getting somewhere, but I'm not sure how far. One local, Tom, a regular, claims that inconsistency is the hallmark of this eccentric little brewery, with no beer tasting the same way twice. This is one they might try to emulate, or improve on a bit. Not much substance, and a touch of skunk flavour, but decent and very real hops.
Hair of the Frog Brown Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hair of the Frog;nose of unsweetened chocolate, light black with light red hues. light in body, chocolate, caramel. sweet, very light bitterness, nearly no hops. rather mellow
Hair of the Frog Brown Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hair of the Frog;Dark brown color. Light chocolate, good roast and a touch of sweetness in the nose. A touch of smoke in the body, lightly roasted and slightly oily. Finishes slightly hoppy but overall is affected by it''s spritzyness.
Hair of the Frog Brown Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hair of the Frog;a nice dark brown with medium sized head, good roasted chocolate malt flavor, but unfortunately way to thin and watery.
Hair of the Frog Brown Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hair of the Frog;Too watery, but a nice roasty, sweet, chocolate flavor. ....................
Hair of the Frog Brown Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Hair of the Frog;If it wasn't so damn thin, it might be a superior brew. Very nice roast and, especially, chocolate flavours. A touch sweet like all HOTF brews.
Hair of the Frog Imperial Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hair of the Frog;dark black with a small but long lasting head. coffee, mild chocolate and dark fruit, moderate alcohol on the nose. Round body with notes of toffee, loads of chocolate, minimal to no hops, very sweet. late alcohol, very sweet as most of the beers at this bar were
Hair of the Frog Imperial Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hair of the Frog;Black with a dark tan head. Nose is nuts, light chocolate and roast with a touch of fruity hops towards the end. The body is creamy and quite roasted, ends up coming across milky. Comes up sweet and organic in the malt area. Finishes with an alcohol shot. A nice imperial stout, although it seems to be a bit sweet which is not unpleasant but maybe a bit unexpected.
Hair of the Frog Imperial Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hair of the Frog;By far the winner of my evening at HOTF, poured a deep dark brown with a bigger head than usual for an imperial, aroma of chocolate malt with a hint of vanilla, alcohol started to show through about midway, had a nice rich chewy mouthfeel, a nice imperial
Hair of the Frog Imperial Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Hair of the Frog;Ok. Maybe it was the fact that I sampled a lot of lackluster beers yesterday. Maybe it was the fact that the company was awesome. But I simply loved this beer. Crystal, the novice beer drinker sitting next to me, even liked this and she's been drinking beer only a few months (a convert, brothers?). It comes on huge with vanilla, chocolate, and spicy alcohol. Enough vanilla in fact, that Crystal claimed it similar to taking a hit of vanilla while making chocolate chip cookies. Why she does that, I don't know, but she's a great woman and fellow lit lover I hope to share a brew with her later this year in Seattle ... Anyway, this is a thick, classy, rich, real beer, a hidden gem on the outskirts of Grand Rapids.
Hair of the Frog Irish Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Hair of the Frog;loads of caramell to start off, roasty with real roasty caramell bitterness. very light in body but quite flavorful. dark dark brown with no head vinous flavors. lasting roasty bitterness
Hair of the Frog Irish Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Hair of the Frog;Dark brown appearance with a little red shining through underneath a tan head. Aroma is reminiscent of Guinness with the light smokey, burnt wood impressions. This beer falls apart in the body though, comes across thin and light and dries quickly towards the end. A touch of roastiness, but nothing that keeps moving into the finish.
Hair of the Frog Irish Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Hair of the Frog;Vaguely reminiscent of DFH Chicory, in fact - that stands out through the decent roast and pleasant bitters. One of two beers at HOTF with a real head and some substance.
Hair of the Frog Copper Frog;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hair of the Frog;Dark red appearance. Slightly sweet malty nose with candyish/fruity hops coming through. The body is lightly bitter and organic with a light maltiness that materializes into an irony finish. Mine was called Copper Lager.
Hair of the Frog Copper Frog;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Hair of the Frog;Now this is the protype HOTF brew, reddish, sweetish, mild, not much body to speak of. It has more smokey, spicy flavours than most, though, so it gets more points.
Hair of the Frog Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Hair of the Frog;This is a serious hole in the wall sort of place with a great small pub atmosphere and very friendly folks. The brewer is wildly creative and cares very little for style guidelines, so be warned! This wheat beer hardly seems wheaty at all. It's a weird orange colorwith no head, bright tasting with a very sweet malty, bocky taste and almost zero traditional wheat flavours.
Michigan Brewing Dry Stout;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Michigan Brewing Company;"I second Hennes comment regarding this beer being so thin. I have come to expect more body in a stout. I also detected something ""rusty"" in the flavor; as if the silos were oxidizing during brewing. neither Hennes or Inveigler mentioned this phenomenon, but I’m sure Hennes excuse would be the ten previous samples. It is for what they obviously tried to achieve with this beer that I gave it a 16 overall. Cheers!"
Michigan Brewing Dry Stout;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Michigan Brewing Company;Nice pillowy head and very rich ebony appearance. Second Hennes comments about the nose, spectacularly rich roasted and coffee aromas. Java notes throughout the first sips, but it recedes into rich malts and nice bitter background. This is a well-balanced stout, and one of the best beers I have sampled at MBC.
Michigan Brewing Dry Stout;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Michigan Brewing Company;I was getting up to leave after sampling ten MBC brews but the bartender stopped me, giving me this one more. I'm glad she did, if only for the nose, with is absolutely huge and gorgeous with roastiness. The flavour is good too, not as big as I hoped, but definite in its admixture of coffee and smokey chocolate that finishes pleasantly long and bitter. The only knock on this seasonal is that its so thin - it gave out so much of its heart in the aroma, leaving it a bit empty inside.
Michigan Brewing Old Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;I have to a gree with daboskasbouter that this was too hoppy for the style. Burnt peach to orange in color with a thin fizzy head. Hops and malt blended pretty well in the aroma. But, man, did the hops come out in the flavor. It was suprising. Not the MBC's best effort.
Michigan Brewing Old Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;Slightly hazy dark orange appearance. Light chocolate and citrusy hops in the nose. Body is spritzy with a firm sweet malt presence. Finishes lightly tart and too hoppy for the style. Not much of an old ale if you ask me.
Michigan Brewing Old Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Michigan Brewing Company;Yet another MBC brew with nice aroma and weak body - that seems to be a distinguishing feature of the brewery. Some citrus, nuts, and cinamon to lend a little complexity but this is more a dressed up American style pale than an old ale, leaning hard with hops.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;Pours a light golden with a 1.5 inch white head. The nose is light and sweet. Light body, some floral and bitter hop notes, lingers well. Some residual sweetness and notes of mixed grain (more towards corn flakes than grape nuts). Lace does form. This is a light, pleasant, if not overly impressive beer. Easy to drink. Thirst quencher! It is not moreish.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;In the bottle from a quickie mart in Mackinaw City. This brew pours amber with a thick yellow-beige head. Very malty aroma. Flavor has good notes of caramel and roastedness to the finish. Nice body, not a thin beer. I think this is under rated.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;Bottle, has a very clear medium to deep gold pour with a hint of amber and brown colors, has a short lived white head that hangs around as a ring and cover, obviously, this has more color than the typical macro beer, leaves little lacing on the sides of the glass, light malt aromas of bread with faint hops, grain and sweetness, some faint peas aroma in the background, flavor of malt and bread with a very present hop bitterness, there is a touch of honey sweetness but this sweetness is minute on the palate, also, a touch of off flavor in this beer, mouth feel is good, this beer could have been a great beer but the nose and flavor have some off-ness, which is unfortunate, I would have given this drink a better grade if it was not for the off fragrance and taste.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;From a 12 bottle obtained in a trade with Erik of indiana, this pouerd a clear an light honey yellow with a small white head and virtually no lacing. Nose of sweatsocks and rotten apples. Watery and fizzy mouthfeel. Flavor is malty with a touch of fruit. Finish dry and bland. This is simply a very ordinary beer.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;12oz plastic bottle-A clear golden body with a decent head and an aroma of nothing. Taste of a typical Helles with nothing to write home about. I’ve had worse.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;Not sure where I had this. Pours a weak tea brown with sour vegetables and flat sugar in the nose. Flavor is a mixture of corn malt and stale flowers. Watery mouthfeel. No mac attack here.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;Pours a honey yellow with a filmy white head despite the vigorous pour. Low key aroma of grains and malt. Taste is mostly inoffensive malt and light hop spiciness. Sour finish with a not entirely pleasant aftertaste. A poor attempt at a mass appeal beer by a brewer who can do much better.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;On tap @ Coles in buffalo NY. Pours a medium golden color. Aroma has some malty sweetness but rather non descript. Flavor is lacking: some malts sweeter & pilsner. Nothing special
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;Goodbar Beer Club. Rich gold, thin white head. Nose is herbal hops, minty/spicy notes, light to medium toffee malts. Flavor is rich malt, herbal & spicy hops, huge malt finish - almost meaty. On the verge of being cloying.
Michigan Brewing Big Mac;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Michigan Brewing Company;Pours honey yellow with a white head. Very little aroma, maybe a light touch of grain, but not much. Smooth, lightly malted, almost a hint of skunk (even though it probably never say much light in its life), and a touch of soap and hops.Nothing outstanding, yet nothing horrible, either.
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;Hazy light yellow, nose is sweet grainy malt, but hints of diacytol present (low). Buttery first sip is disappointing, grainy and wheaty, small amount of grassy hops in the finish, but something has gone wrong along the way. (on-tap @ brewery)
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;Draft, at taphouse. The folks at MBC also tell me it’s an organic grain bill, too. A different taste, not as hoppy as expected (and they certainly are pushing it to have three different pale ales on tap). It's a cloudy yellow in color as expected from a wheat-type beer, and slightly spicy more than bitter, at least to me.
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;I was always thinking about brewing a spelt beer and well here it is a SPELT beer. I can taste the spelt just like the bread to me. I'll give them credit for trying something different. Full tasty enjoyable. Anyways this was nice.
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;Light golden color, light lace. The aroma is grassy, the body sweet malty and spritzy. The sweetness is rather syruppy sweet, kind of like maple syrup sweet without the maple. Light hops in the finish. The one I had was called Spelt Pale. That''s funny, my beer wasn''t moldy. I don''t think I''ve ever had a moldy beer.
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;Moldy Moldy Moldy dog crap. Did I mention this beer was moldy?..............
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;Most unique. Several hard to discribe flavors...all good. Nice hops character and nice finish. Still don''t know what the aftertase was but will drink this again and again.
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;This is quite good, and very different. I've never had anything quite like it. Extremely smooth, some bitterness and sourness. The aftertaste is very strange, sort of citrusy, but hard to describe. I definately recommend giving this a try.
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;As Hennes mentioned this beer is brewed using spelt which makes describing it difficult. The style os reminiscent of a pale ale. Fairly hoppy, but those malt tones! ... like nothing I have ever tried before. This beer is well worth a try, and I think that it could really grow on me with time.
Michigan Brewing Renaissance Brand Spelt Pale Ale;Webberville, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Michigan Brewing Company;They are full out experimeting in Webberville! This one's malt is entirely Michigan grown Spelt, a wheat like grain pushed delightfully by the 12th century nun, Hildegaard, who was also an early proponent of the hop. The beer is, as one might expect, very different. It's transcendently sour and citric, really lemony, with an amazingly soft mouth feel.
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewery. Pretty basic lager. Light with a faint hops and barley grain taste. Very light straw color. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Golden foam. Had a draft at their brewery. Super foamy as the title. Very fruity and wet. Hard to describe. God
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;tap at the brewpub last summer - Pours clear gold with a white head. There’s a mild malt aroma. It tastes of light pils malt and is a bit grainy. The hops is crisp, the brew light bodied, and the finish has lingering bitterness.
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;On tap at Grand Rapids Brewing Company. Straw yellow with no head. Aroma of corn and light hops akin to an American macro. Taste of mild honey, lemon and light hops. Grainy body finishes up corny and astringent. Not very good.
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Draft. A pale yellow pour with a one finger white head.Aroma of grain,corn and bread,some faint hop notes of citrus and spice.Light body with some sour/bitter notes,very little in the way of malt flavor.Smooth mouthfeel,dry slightly tart finish.I am not sure if I really liked this or not,I will go back before long and retry,not bad but nothing special.
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;(Sampled 7-5-08 at brewery from sampler) Transparent like water in appearance with some yellow food coloring added, white ring for a head, aroma of bread, corn, and a small hop note. Hits the mouth with a thin watery body, malt is too weak in the mouth, a single hop flash on the finish. Almost every brewery has to have a BMC clone I guess...
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Tasted 4/27/08. Sampler from the brewpub. Filtered with a golden hue. Trace white head. Grainy bready nose. Light bodied and crisp. Smooth malts. Mild dryness and a touch tart. Solid interpretation.
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Pours gold with light white head. Smells of wheat and grain. It is a plain pils with a metallic finish and bready taste. It goes down smooth though.
Grand Rapids Centennial Silver Foam;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Draft sampler at brewpub. Poured clear pale color with an average frothy white head that mostly diminished with fair lacing. Moderate sour citrus aroma. Light to medium body.

Grand Rapids Pooh Beer;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Pint on tap at brewpub. It was pale with white head, moderate carbonation. Reminded me a little of the rice brewed macro’s but with a good sweetness, rather than a cheap hangover sweetness. It was refreshing and its quality beer but just not enough flavor.
Grand Rapids Pooh Beer;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Tasted 4/27/08. Sampler from the brewpub. Filtered and pale golden. Honey floral nose. Grainy aspect. Light bodied with a tart honey sweetness. Bright yet mild. Smooth and easy. Nothing offensive, yet nothing extraordinary.
Grand Rapids Pooh Beer;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;"GRBC at its finest.....actually im kidding; hazy yellow appearance with aroma of honey, wheat, and mild ctrus hops...flavor was okay (a typical wheat beer with a touch of honey)...pass this one up if u can"
Grand Rapids Pooh Beer;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;One of two GRBC beers that I'd have again, if I were to revist the brewery (unlikely). It has nice, sharp wheat flavours just touched by the honey and some spicy hop action on close.
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;On tap at brewpub. Dark brown with a nice off white head. Bland aroma, some malts come through, nothing unique. Light body for a porter, reminds me of a red. Not much flavor, decent.
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;On tap at Grand Rapids Brewing Company. Brown with red highlights and a thin tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, caramel and toffee. Taste of roasted malts, smoke, peat and light caramel. A bad sourness hovers over this one and it finishes astringent.
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;From what I remember they were selling this as a stout, maybe I am incorrect though. A nice black pour with a whitish head. Roasted malt and some coffee. Aroma does not lie, tastes similarly with some slight chocolate tones. Pretty dry clean finish. Far and away the best of their regular offerings.
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Draft.A dark brown color,with a thin light tan head,Aroma of chocolate and maybe butterscotch,tastes pretty much the same as it smells. This and the Octoberfest were the only thing I tried here that I would order again.
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;(Sampled 7-5-08 at brewery from sampler) Midnight black in color, non transparent when held to the sun. Roasted malt with coffee and dark molasses in the background according to my old sniffer. Hits the mouth with a medium body, malt comes through nicely in translation, very light on the tongue, some caramel and walnuts on the finish. The wife had a snort and compared it to a Guinness Light- I would have to concure with her observations. To be honest, that’s not a bad thing either...
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Tasted 4/27/08. Sampler from the brewpub. Dark as pitch with a brown hue. Toffee and coffee in the nose. Touch burnt. Medium bodied with a nice roasty grainy fruity flavor. Sticky and bitter. Dry finish. Nutty with a hint of molassis. Tasty.
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Pours black with a cream head. Roasted caramel is most noticeable in the aroma. It tastes sickly sweet followed by a dark roast aftertaste.
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Pretty dark brown color, good roasted malt flavor, but light on hops. Part of 5 brew sampler for $4.95!
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Draft at brewpub. Poured dark brown color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Medium body with a smooth texture. Medium balanced bittersweet flavor with a medium bitter finish of moderate duration.
Grand Rapids Lumberman Dark;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;On Tap at GR Brewpub -- Rich aroma of coffe and chocolate. Appearance is an apealing black/brown with a minimal amount of carbonation and light head. Fllavor has a strong hoppy malt with roasted coffe and some fruitiness
Grand Rapids New Earth Mild;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Mild Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Decent goldings flavour accentuates a beer that comes on a tad more aggressively in hops and malt than is usual at GRBC. At least I noticed the action. Far more interesting than most beers here.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at the pub. Clear light spicy color. White head. Grainy aroma, light floral hops. Flavor is grainy, spicy hops. Bitter and crisp finish.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);An excellent Czech -styled pilsner with a mildy nutty malt backing and crisp continental hop character. Great balance. Love the mild malty fade. Pours crystal clear light amber with a sticky large white head. Oodles of lace.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pours a typical golden yellow color with a malt corn aroma. Taste is light, crisp, with a very minimal malt backbone. A crisp, easy drinking beer, true to the style. Nice low ABV that lends to a nice smooth drinking pilsener.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Can. On a United flight. This is a decent little brew and the best you are going to find on a plane.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap, poured into a shaker. The aroma is rocky with some pastry dough and a light toffee touch. The appearance is clear and pale-gold with a mild, soft head that has okay retention and mild lace. The flavor is a muted, medium sweet and a medium light bitter. The texture is thin with a fuzzy carbonation and a medium light body. The profile is buttery with notes of bread and a mild, bitter spice. The finish is spicy and has a rock-like note to it - like a dry, muted mineral tone. The aftertaste has a light tone of minerals and bread toast.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at GI (late 2011) described as a Czech style pils. Pours a hazy golden color with a white head. The aroma has grassy hop notes pale malts with some herbal character. The flavor is grassy, light citrus, pale malt., lightly herbal, clean, crisp, and decent for what it is.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On draft at brewpub, poured a light golden yellow color, aromas of hay, light sweet malt, and some grass. Flavors are the same, light on the palate, decent beer overall.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Enjoyed on tap at Goose Island Wrigleyville while hanging out with some friends before going to see the band Afghan Whigs. I didn’t take notes on this one, but remember it being pretty good and well balanced between crisp malts and very lightly bitter hops. Nothing re-inventing the wheel but great for the style.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft in sampler at the Clybourn brewpub. Pours a clear gold color with a small white head. Notes of grass, straw, and sweet and pils malts. Light-bodied, with a malty mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Crisp all the way through, but not as clean as a better pils because the malt lingers for so long.
Goose Island Pils;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Sampled at Clybourn brewpub. Clear gold. Definite eastern european hops are forward. Light sulphur effects help make for a dry beer. Light fruit adds nicely. Authentic.
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;"i think the hops were so late they got missed altogether, well there is some hopiness, but just a big brewer using inferior ingredients jumping on the ""hop"" ""craft"" bandwagon but failing miserably, not undrinkable but very disappointing and extremely bland"
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Bottle 04/10/2004 Golden amber coloured and hoppy. Some dryness in a bitter lasting finish.
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Bottled. Ooh no, didn’t like this one. Sickly sweet and unrelentingly artificial tasting. Glazes the tongue, but not in a pleasant way. Quite bad.
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;One of Marstons better bottled beers, great summer drinking. Poured a marmalade colour with a thin white head. The floral nose is deliciously zesty, with some limey hop characters. Light bodied and quenching. Has that wonderful Marstons green apple crispness. Here it’s coupled with a citric hop tang and a lingering bitterness. In bottled form, this comes up much better than some of the brewer’s better ales. (Bottle)
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;I respect Marstons, though I wouldn’t say that there are many differences between their session bitters. This is sold together with Pedigree, Single Malt and Double Drop. Maybe the hoppiest of them. Clear bottle, copper colour, thin head, malty and fruity aroma, hoppy, malty and ironish taste. Dry finish.
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;...........................................................................
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Bottled.Deep golden colour, quite a nice looking white head. Very bitter aroma and flavour. Long bitter palate.
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;There are two enjoyable aspects of reviewing beers. Being the first is great and then there is being the tenth which gives rise to the percentile. Ok now to the beer. This is a good amber with the promised nose of hops, The head is thin but still presentable all the way down. The flavour is good but not brilliant. This is the sort of beer that you would expect to see in an English pub, which fom my perspective is not a bad thing, but it isn't a 'wow' beer either.
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Bottled. Filtered and pasteurised. 5.0% April, 2003:I’m not a fan of Marston’s bottled products - though Owd Rodger is a decent ale. This is a typical Marston brew, with the trademark Marston’s malt aroma. I tried this alongside Marston’s Strong Pale Ale. Not a lot of difference. The colour is slightly paler - more sunflower oil than burnt orange. The steady rise of thin bubbles is similar, just less of them. It has the same monk’s head of foam. There is the usual gentle hop bitterness, though well integrated with the malt. Not as sweet, nor quite as fruity as the Strong Pale. Indeed, there is a tobacco quality about the taste. Not a great beer, but certainly drinkable. [2.5] Dec, 2004: In the Marston line up with the Drouble Drop and the Single Malt. Not much between them. This was the driest with the most hop awareness in the finish. Not great quality, but drinkable. [2.3]
Marston's Late Hopped;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;A reasonable beer. Has a good nose full of refreshing hoppy aromas. Pours with vitually no head. The taste dissapointing, it is watery slightly soapy and has a metallic after taste. Certainly not Marstons best work.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Bright brassy gold color. Bubbly white head. Tart fruity malt nose is clean and crisp. Zesty sweet malt flavor. Dry hop finish. A clean crisp ale. It’s a clean machine.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours amber with a small head. Aroma of malt and grains. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is not very tasty.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Had this in a central PA strip bar. Decent malty taste. This one seemed to taste very alcoholic. Decent finish. I probably wouldn't buy this again, but it was somewhat complex in flavor. A stripper even drank one with me.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Weak undertones with thin flavor, but rich color. Overall, not the best ale to find, but will do in a pinch.
J.J. Wainwrights Evil Eye Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Feel for the advertising. Light on flavor, did not sit well. Still better then most of their stuff
J.J. Wainwrights First Brewing Select Lager Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;(Bottle 35,5 cl) Nice amber colur, almost no head. Soft, lightly sweet malty notes of caramel making this a bit more interesting than the average American lager. Not that bad.
J.J. Wainwrights First Brewing Select Lager Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"[bottle] Pours a dark golden brown with a decent sized white head. Very oddly sweet aroma; reminds me a bit of applesauce. Slightly sweet flavor that goes away quickly and leaves no aftertaste. Extremely watery for a lager. Tastes like a light beer."
J.J. Wainwrights First Brewing Select Lager Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;"This has ""CHEAP BEER"" written all over it... and I should have known by the price! I guess it's ""You get what you pay for."" This beer is watery yellow, smells cheap, tastes cheaper, feels cruddy going down, and makes you hand these out when someone comes to visit (either that our pour it into a glass and tell them it's something else). Not gonna retry this one!"
J.J. Wainwrights First Brewing Select Lager Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Golden brown color much darker than most American-style lagers. Very thin head. Light to medium bodied. Nose is slightly sweet. What would be light, refreshing flavor is weighed down by a slightly earthy, metallic bitterness in the finish.
J.J. Wainwrights First Brewing Select Lager Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;The use of roasted barley really does make this lager amber-colored, which comes as a surprise. It lacks much hop bite but rather is fairly sweet and watery. Not complex at all.
J.J. Wainwrights First Brewing Select Lager Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;uhhh. This was not that good. Decent color, but either too much going on, or not enough going on with the taste.
J.J. Wainwrights First Brewing Select Lager Beer;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pittsburgh Brewing Company;Tea-colored with a decent head. This beer managed to be malty-sweet and sour at the same time, which I didn't really like.
AleSmith IPA;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;AleSmith Brewing Company;22 oz bottle 8/17/19 (Tops Liquors-Tempe) 46° in Shaker. Pours a light amber with a small white head. Aroma of grapefruit, citrus, and slight malt. Taste of the same with more hops and a bitterness on the back end. This medium to full bodied brew is well balanced and downright tasty.
AleSmith IPA;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;AleSmith Brewing Company;J'ai donc fini par trouver cette référence dans l'ipa. Et c'est vrai elle est excellente, la canette de 35 cl était trop petite. Des arômes de résineux et de fruits (exotiques, agrumes). Belle amertume et surtout un équilibre parfait et une longueur infinie. Une autre!
AleSmith IPA;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;AleSmith Brewing Company;Bottle from AleSmith, SD - I had this not knowing that it was No 1 in IPAs. but the moment I drank it I knew you could hardly make a better prototype IPA. so round and smooth, so moreish and exceptional. it's the great beers when they come so easy, as if it was nothing to brew a master IPA. no more to say, I tip my hat.
AleSmith IPA;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;AleSmith Brewing Company;0,65l bottle. Aroma of citrus, spruce, pineapple, mango, a blast of tropical fruits, caramel. Taste is citrus, pineapple, a little bit of maltiness, herbs. Medium mouthfeel, the perfect amount of carbonation.
AleSmith IPA;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;AleSmith Brewing Company;Draft at Artisan Burgers in Bangkok. Appearance is a hazy golden hue, with a finger of white froth which recedes to a thin layer. Aromas muted, especially when cold, hoppy citrus and grapefruit. Taste is different, tropical fruit sweetness, piney bitter. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Well made, but not exciting.
AleSmith IPA;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;AleSmith Brewing Company;From the bottle. Hazy copper with an off-white head. Tropical and citrus fruit aroma. Aggressive hop bitterness. A bit of biscuit and slightly toasted malt in the background, but predominantly hop forward. Excellent.
AleSmith IPA;San Diego, California, United States;IPA;AleSmith Brewing Company;Tight white head left s good cover on a hazy dark copper coloured still body. Pine, stewed fruit, sweaty socks, peach & caramel. Medium bodied with a slight tickle over the tongue & softer cloying back. Well balanced tastes of malt, biscuit, pine, grapefruit, hops, resin & caramel with long tangy pithy finish

Dogfish Head Hefe-Weiss;Milton, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dogfish Head Brewery;I had this beer a while back and from what I can remember I enjoyed it. I’ve had this at the pub/brewery so it was fresh. Nothing special about it is popping into my head at the moment.
Dogfish Head Hefe-Weiss;Milton, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dogfish Head Brewery;Golden color, easy to drink, would make an excellent session beer. DFH did a fine job with this German Wheat.
Dogfish Head Hefe-Weiss;Milton, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dogfish Head Brewery;Drink this fine brew after spending a day at the beach or mowing the lawn. Not many wheat beers beat this one.
Dogfish Head Hefe-Weiss;Milton, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Dogfish Head Brewery;Refreshing, balanced, subtle foresty hops, crisp wheatiness. Understated fruitiness would be the only drawback to this summer sessional.
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;"Not sure hoe this is a cream ale... 9 ibu and 4%. nothing wrong with this one, it’s actually quite nice for what it is, but in the end it’s still a ""light"" beer."""
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;Review from memory. Summer 2011. My first DFH beer, and first visit to DFH Alehouse. Light in every way. Not unpleasant, and serves its purpose, but nowhere the bold and interesting ales we come to expect from DFH.
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;On tap at brewpub. Pours a pale yellow color with a small amount of white head. Aroma is light malt with a touch of corn. Flavor is pale malts with some earthy hops.
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;This is def. a starter beer, little flavor and pretty watery, not as bad as mass produced but nothing like any other dogfish brew.
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;"""My girlfriend ordered this at the Ale house in Fairfax VA. I had to try a bit and she loves making fun of me as I jot down notes of beers. A - No head, very light pilsner colored beers. It’s just a wattery looking beer like a Coors or Miller High Life with far less carbonation. S - Lots of wheat with some lemon and fresh cut grass. Very summery smell. T - Tastes like a weak hefeweizen but there’s still flavor here..but it’s very hard to find. M - Very light beer, no carbonation when swishing it around. O - This isn’t a bad beer. DFH took a style of beer that isn’t too represented in craft (with good reason) and made it tasty. I’d drink this over a Budweiser for sure and pick it easily in a blind taste test but it’s just not a beer I’d drink day to day. This beer would go GREAT with burgers and bacon!"""
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;On tap at DFH. Yep, a light beer to please the masses. Was at the brewpub, never had it, so had to try it at least once!
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;Definitely one of the lightest beers I’ve had from Dogfish Head. Light color, aroma and flavor. A great beer for the summer and very sessionable. A really good anytime beer.
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pretty much what you’d expect. Actually remind me of a sweaty betty. Grassy flavor, clean and crisp. Good for what it is.
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;On Tap at the DFH brew pub. Pours pale straw hue with a thin white head. Very fruity, malty aroma has a hint of hops. Light-medium, crisp body. Light, pleasant hops are balanced on the palate by biscuit malt and lemon fruit. Very pleasant, light session beer.
Dogfish Head Lawnmower Light;Milton, Delaware, United States;Cream Ale;Dogfish Head Brewery;11 Aug 2011, tap at the brewpub. yellow, clear some steady bubbles. smells a bit like a slightly sweet, faintly crisp, hoppy lager. thin/med body, a bit fizzy. slightly heavy if it was meant to be a lager (which it’s not). faint toast notes, w/ main flavor of lemon pith, but not much citrus. a sessionable light ale but a bit heavy for a thirst quencher in the summer sun.
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Calling this beer nice is like calling it amiable and well meaning. It doesn’t truly do justice to the Oud Bruin style of my ancestors but had the rich spice and tart aftertaste that I quite enjoy. A good session beer for those who enjoy it, but not the most special oud bruin I have ever had. In saying that though, can I have another?
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Dark ruby-tinged brown with tan head that didn’t last long. Solid roasted malt aromas with some sweet toffee. Same on the palate with the proper amount of carbonation made this very enjoyable. Got even better as it warmed.
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);This was actually a nice beer, but calling it an Oud Bruin can be seen as an insult to the traditional Flanders brewers who have mastered this Indigenous style over the last few centuries. On it’s own, though, this would be a great beer worthy of some praise. Poured into a Tulip glass, an island of off-white foam sat atop a deep cola brown body, with ruby sides. Generous toffee sweet and tart hop aroma, with an underlying mixture of grain husks and acidity. In the mouth rich dark chocolate was pronounced throughout, with a sweet but husky front, aniseed mid palate and a pleasant roasted grain finish. A small amount of spice balances the sweet dark malts. Light bodied, lightly carbonated and rather smooth, this one impressed me and is a step up for this brewery. If they would just reassess the name then they would be on a winner. Very nice!!
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Deep mahogany brown almost opaque with a medium size shortish lasting beige head. Medium bandaid and light biscuity malt aroma. Medium smooth body with low carbonation. One dimensional medium low sweetness roasted malt flavours. Soft roasted bitter malt finish. Mullet reports a plastic twang, yeah I get that like a bottle of cola left too long in a plastic bottle in the sun? Apart from the appearance I Can’t find anything oud briun or Belgian about this one.
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Deep brown, red highlights, head OK but not by Belgian standards. Distinct aroma of mint peas!!! Also chocolate (not the malt) and other spices - perhaps cardamom and lemongrass. Thin body. A touch of choc malt, a bit of a roasty finish with a tiny bit of hop. Some weird plastic twang. Smells quite interesting but really doesn’t have much flavour. As noted by others, this is clearly not a sour beer.
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Very dark brown to black, with some red hues. LIghtly carbonated, with a thin, light brown head. Smokey, slighty sour, fruity aroma. Hint of sour/dryness and mild malt flavours. A nice drop, but a little thin and bland.
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);As I was pouring this brew into the glass I was impressed by the appearance. Dark cola brown colour with a medium sized light tan head that hung around for the journey. Pleasant mix of hops and malt on the aroma. Initial taste of chocolate and cocoa, some spice but not a lot showing, smooth texture, a touch of smoke hiding in there, pepper and a medium body. I think this is a bloody good drop! Cheers!
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);interesting, not really an oud bruin but a good beer anyway. it’s closer to something like Daleside Moroccan Ale than Liefmans Odnar - a spiced old ale or porter. Extremely dark brown with red highlights - could pass for a stout. Really odd fuggles + fennel seed + toffee aroma. Plenty of chocolate malt and a reasonable malt body, along with a very strong aniseed/fennel seed flavour that is a spicy sort of fennel-ouzo flavour rather than a fat licorice root taste. There’s also some sweet cake spice like cinnamon or allspice in there. Bewildering aftertaste of pepper, blackberry and fennel. Quite dry and light. Plenty of flavour certainly, and not totally similar to any other beer I’ve had. Just not an oud bruin. But pisses all over every other Monteiths beer.
Monteiths Oud Bruin;Greymouth, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Dark brown colour. Belgian yeast aroma. Fruity yeast notes in the initial flavour, followed by Belgian malts (slightly chocolatey), and slight cinnamon notes on the finish. All in all, it's well rounded and fairly smooth. Easily Monteith's best effort to date.
Circle Breweries Hemp Beer;Henderson, Auckland, New Zealand;Flavored - Other;Circle Breweries;Golden colour. Hemp seed aroma and slight hemp flavour. Clean and crisp. Overall though, it is fairly light and lacking in flavour.
Fordham & Dominion Maibock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Got this in a trade a while back but I do not know who sent it, but thank you. poured a amber color with a white head. aroma, some malts and toffee, yeast, grassy. flavor, about the same as aroma but with a hint of alcohol
Fordham & Dominion Maibock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;I’m kinda liking these Maibocks when I try them. Appearance and aroma were unnoteworthy. But this had a good taste balance. Sweet but not too sweet. Hoppy but not too hoppy. Tasted like apples. I’d try this again and give some patronage to my fellow Delawarians.
Fordham & Dominion Maibock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;From a 12 oz. bottle with a blurb on the back label, no freshness date, sampled at cellar temperature in a pilsener glass. Poured a clear golden hued tarnished orange with a frothy, rocky white head, good retention, settled in a thin sudsy lacing, minimal amount of ringed sticking. A grape and red plum fruity aroma with a light amount of spiciness and sweet bready malts. Tiny bubbles at the top, moderate carbonation overall, and a crisp, dry, smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel. Pleasant. but average tasting, sour grapes and dates, the fruitiness meshes with the alcohol to give the taste a mild acidity, grain bready with a hidden touch of sweet caramel, an soft earthy spice, herbal bitterness, and a dry sour fruity, grainy finish. Not a bad Maibock, I know my score reflects having tasted a much better Maibock at a brewpub last week, didn’t have the overall malty sweetness one would expect from a Maibock.
Fordham & Dominion Maibock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. Pours golden with white head that quickly diminishes with slight lace. Wheat aroma. Clean mellow taste that fills mouth with malt and slight bitter hops.

Fordham & Dominion Maibock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;bottle @ Newtown brewfest. Bottle was warm (as noted by other raters). Amber pour with heavy malt aroma. Very rough on the palate with a wide variety of flavors from herbs to grass to hops that didn’t seem to meld together very well. Should have been much better.
Fordham & Dominion Maibock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;bottle at Newtown Brewfest. Chilled on ice, but still was kinda warm when served. Pours a clear light amber with a fluffy white head which fades a bit. Aroma is a bit sugary sweet, almost artificial, caramel and light toasted malts but the intense nutty and bready malts werent there. Herbal hops in the flavor with more sugary sweetness and even apparent alcohol towards the end. This wasnt very good.
Fordham & Dominion Maibock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Sampled with Stegosaurus and Beerded_one at Newtown Beerfest. Pours a hazy gold with fizzy head. Sweet and grassy aroma. Same as in taste. Ehh it is what it is.

Light reddish gold like a Star Wars moon, thin off white head. Aroma of hops, chocolate and caramel hints.

Arom: Smörkola, sura frukter och kräftspad (!?). Gräs, krusbär, karamell och (åter) kräftspad i smaken. Mycket märklig APA. Mycket märklig öl överlag. Gott? Tja, jag vet faktiskt inte.
Max California Common Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Max Lager's;Looks just like the IPA, but the smell and flavor differ. Light fruit on the notes with a thin caramel in the flavor, but perhaps a little hoppy by the style standards. Clean malt in the finish.

Max California Common Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Max Lager's;Amber yellow with an okay head and medium body. Fruity, nutty, and carmel aroma. Good balance between malt and hops. Not overly hoppy which is a good thing with this beer. Clean aftertaste. Not like an Anchor Steam (the beer menu compares this brew to those steam beers in California). A good beer.
Max California Common Ale;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Max Lager's;Aroma was an interesting mix of whiskey, rock candy and must. Very smooth, somewhat wood/nutty, and not hoppy compared to the other heavily-hopped brews that Max Lagers serves up. A very bronze brew.

Tesoro;Mayaguez, Puerto Rico;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Compañía Cervecera de Puerto Rico;Yawn... I almost fell asleep in my glass.

Poured a crystal clear golden amber with a one-finger bright white foamy head that diminished slowly to a very thin collar that laced OK. Carbonation moderate, slow and fine to medium. Aroma of slightly sweet malt which is slightly sweeter than other Myanmar lagers; no obvious hops. Taste of slightly sweet malt that is slightly stronger than other Myanmar lagers; no real bitterness. Light body. Crisp and smooth with a short, sweet finish."
Troutbrook Summer Lager;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;I really wasn't into this stuff. I guess it's good, but I think you really have to want to like it. I'm not much for lagers in general, although I do like a good pilsener. This didn't really do it for me.
Troutbrook Summer Lager;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Great head and lace. The beer is naturally hazy. I detect a little bit of dyacetyl in the nose and on the palate. The butterscotch becomes much more noticeable as the beer warms. I guess having a summer brew a few days into fall is probably not a good idea, but the bottle does not have an age statement. Who knows when it was packaged.
Troutbrook Summer Lager;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;The more I drink this beer, the more I appreciate it.Fruity,spicy,and quite refreshing.
Troutbrook Summer Lager;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;A good summer brew. Light, but still has character.........................
Troutbrook Summer Lager;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Nice lemon flavor but a little watery. Had some aftertaste but overall a decent beer.
Troutbrook Summer Lager;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Clear straw. Foamy white head. Moderate carbonation. Toasted white bread aroma, grassy hops. Crisp yet full bodied with a toasted malt aspect, fresh mown hay and spicy hops. Clean and dry. Slight fruity yeastiness appears as it warms. Finishes well balanced with a touch more malt sweetness and increase in hop spiciness. A very good, non American Wheat, Summer brew.
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;INteresting, not so bitter but quite amber. Cloudy and with a graspy aftertaste. Strong and nice too.
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Dark amber color. Malty and hops aroma. Malt flavors with some roasted flavors. Hop finish. Great label. Please bring this beer back to bottles!!
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;On Nitro A: pours a yellowish copper color, with a great creamy white head that leads to outstanding lacing. S: big draws of citrus brought on by the hops. Small hints of sweetness, almost like butterscotch. Very clean and crisp. T: very smooth and very creamy. hints of oranges with subtle hop flavors. great sweetness delivered from the malts. Light flavor of creamy butterscotch. Absolutely delicious. M: Very creamy and smooth leaves the mouth craving for more. so many complex flavors, but it doesn’t shock the palate, it pleases it. extremely well-balanced. D: Warning: you can easily drink 8 pints of this rather quickly. It is so smooth. Great job Alan Pugsley
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a medium brown. The hops are overpowering for my tastes and make the beer pretty bitter overall. It mellowed a little bit as I worked my way through it, but the initial taste was very hoppy.
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Tap. Aromas of roasted, pine and some dried fruit with spices. Head is small, frothy, white with fair lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is clear reddish amber. Flavor starts faintly sweet and a little acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and moderately bitter. Palate is light to medium,watery with a lively carbonation and a lightly dry finish. A pretty good amber, but just about them same as every other middle of the road amber.
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Nitrogen draft at redlight redlight. I had this one as the Shipyard Nitro. Not a bad session beer. Pours amber with a tight white creamy head. Notes of caramel and very subtle hints of hop in the background. The flavor is smooth. Not very complex but a nice balance of sweet and bitter. Great creamy mouth-feel.
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Pours reddish brown with a tan head. Smells of sweet malt, some sweet citrus, earthy tea. Tastes earthy and tea like with some spicy hints on the finish.
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Medium brown head. Opaque black body with dark brown edges. Roasty licorice and coke aroma. Dry licorice, chocolate, and coffee taste with soy notes. Light body. Dry roasty soy and burnt grain aftertaste. It’s OK, I guess. (0.65l bottle, Systembolaget, Charlottenberg.)
Shipyard Winter Ale Special Brew;Portland, Maine, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Shipyard Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a dark amber body with a white head. Some berry, toffee, and butter malty character with some earth and caramel. Gone before you knew it.

Warm ruby, persistent fine tan head. Bright toasty cake aroma, a little lemon. Toffee, grape sweetness, some apparent alcohol. Butter, a touch of resiny hops in the finish. A very nice little wintery amber.
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Bottle. Poured clear amber color with a medium frothy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate sweet grainy aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met.
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;bottle at Our House in Allston. Best deal in Boston but not a particularly good beer. Some corn in the taste but nothing to write home about. SOlid cheap brew
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;"Like the previous rater I got this at Our House in Allston. I drank this out of the bottle because this is how Boston Bars like to do it. It is pretty much a crappy pale lager if you want to find the cheapest beer in the bar. It isn’t offensive; it is better than Lionshead; it is obviously not too good."
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Bottle @ Our House in Allston. Like the review below, great deal at @ $2 for a half liter. Better than most American macros, but not by much. Corn & barley tastes that do not excite but also do not repulse.
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;$2 bottle at Our House in Allston. Great value for $2. I’ve had this lager with and without a lime. Why? Because I’ve had it a million times so I need to change it up once in a while. This is a good drinking beer, not chugable because of its rich flavor. Certainly not the best beer available but certainly worth a try if you don’t want to spend a lot.
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Only a dollar at Colonial Spirits, in Acton. I was slighly scared to try this, especially considering the pencil-shaving aroma. I was pleasantly surprised. It’s more than drinkable. Tastes like it cost a dollar, but it wasn’t a dollar wasted.
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;"Ah, this takes me back to college. Nothing like a $2 Brubaker ""pounder."" Drinkable and not too light, fairly basic tasting. Wouldn’t go so far as to call it ""good,"" but it’s good for a night out and your wallet."
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Bottle. I was not given a glass for this magnificent beer, so I can not rate the color. I’ll just assume it looks like Coors Light. Aroma from the bottle is of skunky malt. Kind of like malt that had rotted in my gym socks (this could of course be the bottle and the nasty ice water it was soaking in). Taste is light and sweet with a little malt to be found. The greatest thing about this beer is it’s $2 for a 16oz bottle. I even got it for that price in downtown boston where a Bud will cost you $4. This is way better than Bud, and I’m kicking up it’s overall rating based on the price.
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Pours with a light white head that fades slowly, leaving a some lace. Light-medium carbonation. Clear light amber color, light-medium bodied, starts malty and sweet, finishes mellow with some crispness, good session beer. $1.05 for a 16 oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA.
Brubaker;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;16oz bottle. for $3... smells like macro swill, looks like macro swill...*takes sip*... tastes like macro swill...but hey, its cheap and the label is ghetto and I need it for my BU Pub Quest.

Golden City Legendary Red Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Golden City Brewery;can as a gift. This is a really clear beer with a bold color and a firm white head. Quite good looking. The aroma is nutty with caramel, a touch of wet hay/wet dog, and subtle hints at berries. The body is medium with carbonation levels right in the middle too. Sweet flavors of bread and toffee almonds come through. I was expecting an American red ale when I cracked this, but this is clearly European leaning. I get big Munich malt impressions. It finishes clean and semi-sweet. Not much hop character to speak of. It's all about the malt with flavors of nuts, biscuits, puffed rice, and toffee.
Golden City Legendary Red Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Golden City Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Poured reddish amber with an off white head. Aroma was caramel, sweet malt. Taste was bittersweet, caramel, toasted malt.

Golden City Legendary Red Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Golden City Brewery;On tap at the brewery, GABF week 2014. I did not know exactly what kind of beer this was while drinking it, but i did not think altbier. Mild malt aroma and flavor. Low carbonation, not too heavy on the palate making it easy to drink, but I thought more of a red ale than an alt.
Golden City Legendary Red Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Golden City Brewery;Cool looking can. Pours a hazy reddish brown with hardly any head. Got a bit of a green apple aroma/flavor problem. Ick. Pretty malty with a lingering bitter finish. Flawed.
Golden City Legendary Red Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Golden City Brewery;Bottle from the brewery. Pours a clear, deep ruby color with little to no head. Light aroma of some malt. But not much after that. Light roasted malt and caramel taste. Both flavor and aroma are kind of lacking. Not that great of a beer.

Golden City Cherry Bomber Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Golden City Brewery;"On tap at GCB as ""Cherry Bomber Inspired Ale"". A Kölsch + Cherries. Cloudy amber appearance with a small white head and light lacing. Fruity and sweet cherry flavor with light malts and a fruity finish. Not bad, just a fairly one-dimensional fruit beer."
Golden City Cherry Bomber Ale;Golden, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Golden City Brewery;Head is initially small, fizzy, off-white, fully diminishing. Body is dark reddish brown, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly malty (light bread, caramel), with a light note of cherry. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic.

Circle Breweries Old Thumper;Henderson, Auckland, New Zealand;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Circle Breweries;Light amber-orange colour. Fruity aroma and fairly bland fruity malt flavour. Slightly buttery.
Stolberg Black Brut Stout;Henderson, Auckland, New Zealand;Stout;Circle Breweries;Black in colour, small fluffy head. soft aroma of coffee. bitter coffe tatse but has no bdy or bite.
Stolberg Black Brut Stout;Henderson, Auckland, New Zealand;Stout;Circle Breweries;Malted chocolate aroma. Sweet oatie/chocolate flavour. Relatively thin bodied for a stout, but still well rounded with a coating mouthfeel. Quick, clean finish.
Stolberg Hooker Ale;Henderson, Auckland, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Circle Breweries;have to agree with eczy that this just tastes like speights gold with extra alcohol. no hops, hint of toffee and metho
Stolberg Hooker Ale;Henderson, Auckland, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Circle Breweries;"called just ""extra strong ale"" when i had it? dunno if a beer this useless justifies the hassle of entering a new beer. tastes of bland nutty malt and nought else apart from formaldehyde, like Speights with 2% more alc. bland. short on the palate, monotone on the palette, should be minimal stocks on the pallet."
Stolberg Hooker Ale;Henderson, Auckland, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Circle Breweries;nice gold colour with big spritzy head. little or no aroma. sweet almost brnady tatse
Stolberg Hooker Ale;Henderson, Auckland, New Zealand;Strong Ale - English;Circle Breweries;Pale, slightly cloudy, golden-yellow colour. Candy malt aroma. Sweet, sugary, Belgian-type malt flavour. I'm told by the brewer that this beer is lagered and it is reflected in its smoothness and rounded flavour. Basically a lagered tripel. Interesting concept, which I rather like.
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;On tap. Pours gold. Lemon, plum, sweet, sharp vinegar. Extremely clean and pretty tasty.
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;Pours a crystal clear, almost neon gold with no head even when forced. Moderate aromas of honey and wild flowers with a mild grain bite and an unidentifiable dank note. Flavours bring more of the savoury, basement dankness forward, accented by the honey floral notes from the aroma. Somewhat sweet and medium-full bodied. The sweetness lingers in the finish.
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;On tap in the beer garden at the brewpub. 4% ABV Deep golden with excellent clarity and a decent head. Feel: Crisp, with medium+ carbonation and a dry finish. Quite aromatic and fruity for style, and with high quality at that. The flavor is more average but certainly satisfying. Lasting, mildly bitter, hoppy aftertaste. O: Recommended, although not the most interesting beer from Mussel Inn.
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;New World Kiwi hops give it a citrus character that’s reminiscent of Cascade and Hallertau (orange gelatin candy, apricot nectar, lemon balm, pepper / spice, a little bit of cheese rind mustiness) while a quieter intrusion of Nelson / Motueka give it that burnt pineapple / papaya and green onion character. Malt sits in the background with a soft honey succulence. Body is savory and rich but malt texture is brash, which the rough carbonation amplifies. Medium+ bitterness, medium sweetness, prickly acids which combined with the harsh texture make a half-glass about all I can stand. Flavor and aroma-wise this might be a high 3 if the body were smoothed out. From draft.
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;The head is ok, body blond. It smells malty, sweet. The taste is malty, sweet, spicy. Sweet, less sour. Ok…
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;Appears to be a well made lager. Clear yellow poor with slight white head that disappears quickly. Slightly sweet. Refreshing.
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;"Pours golden and clear, thin dissipating head. Aromas of gooseberry, grass, tangelo and meringue. Initially full with loads of carbonation. Light, soft and slow to develop flavour. A tinge of bitterness and dries on the palate. Tails off herbally (roemary and chives) with freshly buttered toast. Not a full on flavour attack but pleasant. ""An easy drinking lawnmower beer"" quoth the brewer. Bang on."
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;The colour was golden amber with a moderate head. There was a crisp green hoppy aroma. The flavour had smooth ginger and biscuity malt, and medium bitter hops and dry yeasty finish. This beer had nicely balanced flavours with a crisp light bitter finish. A very pleasant beer without being outstanding.
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;330ml bottle. Doesn’t look too bad compared to most pale lagers. Thick merengue of white foam that leaves a good bead of lacing on the glass. Deep golden amber colour with a citrus hop aroma. A bit dry in the finish with some mild bitterness in the flavour. Overall this is pretty good for a pale lager.
Mussel Inn Golden Goose;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;The Mussel Inn;"330 ml bottle Aroma: Hoppy, floral; Appearance: golden brown with large head dissipating quickly leaving minimal lacing; Taste: surprisingly mild yeast with very little bitterness; Palate; medium to light body, trace of astringency, finishes quickly to a yeasty aftertaste; Overall: Not all the remarkable but a nice drop."
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;On tap at the brewery. Pours black. Chocolate, coffee, plum and fig, bit of toast, some bitter roast but not too much. Medium body. A well balanced easy to drink dark ale.
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;Dark brown, really nice dark malt complexity, dry finish with a toasty, chocolate note.
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;Small beige head dark pour aromas mild roast coffee chocolate hint of caramel flavours roast coffee liquorice note chocolate medium bitter milky note has some richness in it a fair sweetness finish a little down in taste but drinkable some okay bitter sweet backing but needed more oomph
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;"On tap in the beer garden at the brewpub. Deep and dark mahogany; clear with a decent head. Feel: Lightly crisp, with low (too low) carbonation and a semi-dry finish. A bit watery Aroma: a mix of lager and schwarzbier. The flavor is more average but certainly satisfying. Lasting, mildly bitter, hoppy aftertaste lacks dark roasted malt flavor. O: Not bad, but disappointing."
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;"As others have said, and as it says on the bottle, it’s not a porter it’s a dark beer and it is very nice... until the metallic/ tinny aftertaste kicks in. And if you let it sit, after a while the aroma changes from malt to malt-with-a-hint-of-vinyl, but if you give it a swirl, it’s back to malt again. That drags it down from ""very good"" to ""better than a macro"". Maybe my bottle wasn’t fresh."
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;Bottled. A pitch black beer with a lazing tan head. The aroma has notes of roasted malt, soy sauce, and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of roasted malt, soy sauce, and caramel, leading to a dry roasted finish.
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;The Mussel Inn are producing a bunch of competent beers, but they are not leaders, or trend setters, or making their own path, they’re just making a beer. I cried.
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;So fitting to call it a Dark Horse! First of all I wound never chose it out of the shelf if not with the specific intention to try it. Not an appealing presentation. But surprise: this is bloody good! This Dark Horse makes it ahead! Nice dark chocolate nose, so dark that it gets bitterer by the minute. Good sign. Hardly any mocha or coffee notes. That’s another point. I’d say this is much more of a chocolate stout, so strong the cocoa notes are, but never a sweet stout. Bitter and sweet are well balanced on the flavour. It is full bodied, taste is round and well packed with a chalky feel, perhaps the char having turned to ashes. Not bad at all! Extremely pleasant to drink. The Mussel Inn boys gave their recipe to the right people to brew it.
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;Bottled from South City New World, Christchurch, NZ. Sark colour, with big head. Chocolate nutty flavour. Medium-strong bitter finish.
Mussel Inn Dark Horse;Onekaka, New Zealand;Porter;The Mussel Inn;You can’t see through it and it has a mocha head that subsides slowly. Chocolate malt aromas, nutty roastiness. Similar in aroma to just about every other microbrew dark ale and a similar taste too. Could easily be mistaken for Invercargill Pitch Black. Nice enough, but not outstanding.
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;(Bottle) Average stout. Unfortunately alcohol is showing little too much in the taste and aroma could be stronger.
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;as below, the alcohol is so overwhelming on this one that it strangles everything else. it’s a little hard to see beyond the alcohol, although there certainly was a fairly nice stout below there. oh well.
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;Blood red black, with no noticeable head, but a lovely aroma of plums, chocolates, and alcohol. The flavour is dry bitter, nice to start, in spite of the coffee notes, but the 7% takes over everything, smothering the roasts and the licorish, feeling like there’s a lot more alcohol in the beer. I would have liked to see it more subtle and taste the stout better.
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;Pours very dark with rosy port-like notes. Little apparent head and is a sort of off-white. Smells of port, flowers, molasss, fresh coffee ad has flavour of that same port, toffee, pumpernickel and medicinal alcohol. The bitterness isn’t overpowering, rather complimentary to the lush winey flavours. It ought to have been served slightly warmer than it was, but that’s not a fault of the beer.
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;Sampled at Beervana. No tasting notes I’m afraid, and it was too long ago to remember specific details. I do remeber being reasonable Impressed though.
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;Bottle, available only at the brewery. Oily black pour, brief head with no lace. Sweet aroma of treacle, chocolate, and fig jam. Rich figgy flavour, sweet and fruity with some chocolate liqueur. I couldn’t find any burnt malt here. Sweet, full bodied, warm finish.
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;(Bottle 33 cl) Comes in a Danish beer bottle! Pours very dark brown with a vague tint of orange and a rough, beige head. Big aroma of nuts, wood and alcohol. Good, full, body, very low in carbonation with plenty of accents of dried fruit, nuts, wood and alcohol. Slightly burned in the finish. As most Mussel Inn beers this defies category, but I find Old Ale to be the closest style. 310108
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;Tasted 31/01/2008. Bottle direct from the brewery, courtesy of Papsoe. I see a garnet highlighted dark brown beer that’s so lowly carbonated it borders on lifeless. Looks like it would love to go through a beer engine, to turn the airy disappearing head into a thick foamy collar. Chocolate, sweet espresso, cola, liquer and a little lacquer greet the nose. In the mouth it is much of the same, like a chocolate liquer with coke. The finish is a little overwhelmingly lacquer-like. Great cask style carbonation and full weighty mouthfeel. Very nice strong mild recipe that hasn’t quite been executed right.
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;330 ml bottle from the pub. Pours afine black with warm brown tinges. Sweet aroma almost bourbon tinged with char notes. Beautiful full whipped cream head, almost like a cappichino. Lovely body, warm toffee with coffee & slightiest touch hop dry finish. Almost like caramello but with dark chocolate. Suprisingly easy to drink given it’s abv. Beautiful beer from a fine establishment
Mussel Inn Strong Ox;Onekaka, New Zealand;Stout;The Mussel Inn;Bottled. Near black, no head. Roasty and lightly grainy. Very dry and salty with medium body. The mouthfeel is a little bit coarse, but when it warms some coffee and chocolate shows up and covers that. Surprisingly low bitterness.
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;Bottle at the Jester’s House. I thought I had rated this already. Anyway, it is a nice and simple beer, cloudy golden colour, aroma of lemon, fruits and something sweet. Flavour is grassy but fresh, not too sharp, with lemon, grapefruit, some type of citrus sorbet, and a background of malt. Beer is crisp and full-bodied.
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;Bottle in Nelson, 11/6/2014. Listed at 7%. Pours a copper color, thin fizzy head, decent lacing. Aroma is straw malts, light honey caramel, nice citrus, tropical notes with slightly vinous hoppy grass notes. Taste is moderately bright citrus, spicy pine and grass, light toasted straw. Light, crisp body. Decent pale ale.
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;rating from backlog, sugary sweetness dominates, not an awful lot of flavour beyond that. okay.
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;Similar golden colour and head to the Golden Goose. Aroma is summery, coase grass, lemon meringue and spices. Flavours of ornage lobes, lemon twist that brins a twang of acid and then very softly bitter. The aftertaste is strong, spicy and lingering. It makes the act of drinking this beer secondary to the arrival of the flavour.
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;Pours a hazy amber with a small white diminishing head. Nice lacings. Sweet and very bitter. Heavy malt aromas of grain. Some alcohol notes. Bitter finish.
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;(Bottle 50 cl) Pours a slightly hazy golden with a creamy, off-whitehead leaving a neat, broad lacework. Aroma of fruit, diacetyl and alcohol. Quite full-bodied with a very soft and velvety mouthfeel, lots of fruit and a whiff of Belgian yeast. The finish is astringent and alcoholic. 310108
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;Tasted 31/01/2008. Direct from the brewery, courtesy of Papsoe. Cheers! Pours a brilliant pale rose gold with a just off-lacy white head. Sea spray dry hop character and spice on the nose. Some alcohol and ripe stonefruit in behind. Lucious malt sweetness in the mouth, carried by velvety full weight and soft carbonation. Justa little hop flavour anda very mild bitterness. Becomes a little too warming and phenolic in the finish. More Belgian than English, for me.
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;Tasted Jan 07 @ Brewpub. Bottle cond - Mid golden colour, slightly cloudy. Sweet butterscotch start with a mild hop dry finish. Soft carbonation - nice beer
Mussel Inn Pale Whale Ale;Onekaka, New Zealand;Pale Ale - Australia / NZ;The Mussel Inn;Bottled. Cloudy amber, very small head. Hoppy aroma of melon and mango. Medium sweet and near full bodied with soft mouthfeel. The bitterness is surprisingly low after all the hop aroma. A full sized ale displaying NZ hops, but perhaps not the most complex of their beers. Mussel Inn however rank as one of the most charming locations to have a beer anywhere.
Mussel Inn White Heron;Onekaka, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mussel Inn;On tap at the brewery. Pours slightly hazy light yellow. Bubblegum, peach, pepper, cereal, minerals. Spritzy body. Quaffable.
Mussel Inn White Heron;Onekaka, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mussel Inn;Draft. A yellow beer with a white head. The aroma has notes of straw and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, straw, and fruit, leading to a bitter finish.
Mussel Inn White Heron;Onekaka, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mussel Inn;What strikes me first and foremost is that it is clear. Not cloudy or with generous amounts of banana or clove. Instead you get a nosefull of sharp malt and aromatic lager if anything. Such an odd beer because there was no indication of the wheat malt unless this was a kristalweizen. Easily drinkable though.
Mussel Inn White Heron;Onekaka, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mussel Inn;"(On tap) In their own beer menu description this is called a ""Crystal Weizen"". Almost clear, pale golden with a small, white head leaving some lacing. Very delicate and sophisticated aroma from the Sauvin hops - I think I can actually smell some Sauvignon Blanc here - is that where the hops got their name from? Medium body with a dry malt base and a fairly bitter finish. 290108"
Mussel Inn White Heron;Onekaka, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Mussel Inn;500ml bottle @ the bar. Bottle conditioned. Pale straw gold. Marmalade and a touch of wheat on the nose. The flavours are balanced & very subtle. Buttery, vanilla with the wheat not too pushy. Deft.
Mussel Inn Heat Rash Chilli Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;The Mussel Inn;I was extremely lucky to have got a bottle where the chilli hadn’t been in for a long time, otherwise I would have handed my mouth back to its maker for a new one*. In ddition to the standard aromas there is a rush of capsicum and cayenne on the nose. It smells dangerous. It tastes dangerous too. There’s a rickly heat that starts on the tongue and speads downward. The aftertaste of the piquancy lasts for a good twenty minutes. Wow, just wow. *When I was five, my father was dryin cayenne peppers in his lounge and I was told not to touch them and so I was left alone in the house with orders not to touch something. Well, I touched them. And my face and my eyes and my mouth. In hindsight it was my first self-inflicted learning opportunity and it is only now that I’m at law school that I’m asking what father leaes a five year old in a house by himself all afternoon? Bastard.

Poured golden, with a white diminishing head and a chilli on top! Aromas of chilli, thats about it. Strong capsicum flavour, warming the mouth with a slight spicyness. Some hops are present with a malty background. Wierd but nice!
Mussel Inn Heat Rash Chilli Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;The Mussel Inn;Tasted 31/01/2008. Bottle direct from the brewery, courtesy of Papsoe. Pours gold with a slight haze, a disappearing head and a light lace. Green chilli and a little ginger dominate the nose, with an underlying note of lolly-like malt. Sweet malt and hot chilli dominate the mouth, and a low carbonation level really allows the chilli to really show its hand. My sinus tickles just reminiscing about this one. The best commercial chilli beer I’ve had thus far - but that’s not even close to saying I’d buy it for anything other than a laugh.
Mussel Inn Heat Rash Chilli Beer;Onekaka, New Zealand;Flavored - Chili / Peppers;The Mussel Inn;(Bottle 33 cl) Pours a hazy golden with a small, off-white head. Very peppery aroma.

Mussel Inn Monkey Puzzle;Onekaka, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;The Mussel Inn;An interesting beer that tasted like a cross between the advertised Belgian strong ale and a regular double/imperial IPA.

Mussel Inn Monkey Puzzle;Onekaka, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;The Mussel Inn;On tap at Meow in Wellington. A big 10% beer like we brew in America. Finally found a big beer in New Zealand. This beer has a rather mild aroma but in all fairness it should have been served in a snifter instead of a half pint. Flavor is malty with a nice sweetness balance. Alcohol is present and almost has a barrel aged bourbon flavor even though I don’t believe it us barrel aged. Color is deep amber and poured clear and not hazed. Enjoyable!
Mussel Inn Monkey Puzzle;Onekaka, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;The Mussel Inn;Monkey Puzzle? More like muddle puddle to look at. Not that I wish to denigrate the efforts of the fine people at the Mussel Inn, but this was not a good looking beer. It was good smelling though with aromas of marmalade, carob (I hate carob), cocoa and stewed apricots. This was evident in the flavour, of which there was shitloads, along with the distinct warming alcohols that let you know that you’d better not be contemplating driving after this one. The lingering finish was interrupted by my learned off-sider who wanted me to try their heat rash chilli beer. Ah well, I’ll just have to try again tomorrow.
Mussel Inn Monkey Puzzle;Onekaka, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;The Mussel Inn;Bottle from beerstore.co.nz. Bright orange in colour with thin white head, which disappeared quickly. Big malt aroma. Spicey nutmeg/honey flavour that lingers in mouth for ages.
Mussel Inn Monkey Puzzle;Onekaka, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;The Mussel Inn;On tap at Beervana 2008. Pours cloudy amber. Aroma is yeasty with some hop & sweetness. Explodes with flavours, sweet beginnings, then some milk chocolate leading into caramel, hops remain throughout in the background. The bitterness breaks through the sweetness to make this a really balanced strong flavoured dangerously drinkable beer.

La céréale est plus présente en bouche, surtout en finale, et les saveurs d’abricots semblent moins fausses. Ce n’est pas une très grande réussite, mais ça se boit très bien à 30 degrés Celsius.

5 Seasons Dunkelweizen;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;5 Seasons Brewing Company;This was called Morans dunkelweizen at the Alpharetta location (10/30/08).

Hook Norton Haymaker (Bottle);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hook Norton Brewery;Amber and slightly cloudy, with very little head. The aroma is pretty powerful: deep and sweet and malty, with notes of red apple and whiskey, along with a hint of brown bread. Bitterness is (just about) assertive enough, lingering nicely in the finish and aftertaste. There is also a neat little dry edge to the flavour. All in all, this beer could be close to fantastic and I'm hard pushed to tell what's missing and why I'm not uber-excited - probably something to do with overall balance. But it's not a huge gripe and I would certainly buy this one again.

Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;Had a bottle from Adam. Absolutely outstanding IIPA. Nice mellow flavor without overly hoppy aftertaste.
Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;Originally reviewed: 10/20/09. Poured into my conical pint glass. Pours a very cloudy copper gold with a big 2-finger off-white head resting on top. This sticks around a good bit, and leaves plenty of sticky lace. Smells of peppery spices mixed with a sharp twang. Not a big citrus or piney scent, very subtle. The feel of this one is crisp and clean, but it sips well. Slight creamy quality to it makes it a pleasure to drink. The spices I got in the nose come out in the flavor as well. Definitely some big time bitterness going on here, but it’s of the spicy variety. Dull black pepper start to this, that finishes more mellow and grainy. The semi-sweet citrus that I enjoy in IPAs is absent in this beer, but it’s still decent. It’s a different take on the style, and I commend them for it. I wouldn’t want many of these at a time as the spicy nature would wear on me, but I’d have it again.
Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;aroma is lemon, lighty grainy sweetness, clean pale malt. appearance is full head that reduces to near belgian cotton candy, with absolutely huge lacing, good carb, lightly hazed gold. flavor is buried pine and balanced lemon/clean pale malts. light maltiness without even bare caramel and equally as simple but powerful enough hopping.
Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;12 oz bottle. Is this really a winter seasonal? If so, I probably should not be rating this because it does taste a bit stale. What is interesting about this beer is I really can’t detect an aroma or flavor profile to write about. It is pretty much without either. There is a malt backbone and maybe some hints of citrus. But, even though it is a light bodied beer with some lively carbonation, there is a hop bitterness in the finish that I am able to give props to. Another than that, not a very good IPA.
Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Thick, cloudy orange-tan color with a respectable head on it. Lots of earthy hoppy citrus flavor up front, followed by a nice toasty malt balanced, watery finish. Solid soapy/astringent bitterness. Walking the line between medium and full bodied, it remains pretty sessionable while still being quite flavorful. A respectable IPA.
Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle at Lunar Brewing Co.. Poured a hazy, orange/amber with a light orange tint to the off white, foamy head, leaving some nice ribbons of lacing. The aroma was light with floral and citrus notes. The flavor added an astringent bitterness that over shadowed any good malt presence. Light bodied, drinkable, but unimpressive.
Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;Hazy pour, light amber or dark gold, large white head, abundant sticky lace. Soapy hops bitterness, way more bitterness than aromatic qualities, malts have a worty, fresh oatmeal quality to them, but also a lactic staleness. There are some nice fruit qualities, citrus, apricot. Medium body, palate is both soft and lively. Disappointed: there’s a good beer trying to get out of here, but it didn’t make it.
Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;12oz bottle. yike this is bad. rarely if ever say that but this one’s a mess. smells like hop extract, no hop flavor just bitterness, and it tastes like crap. pass on it.
Harbor City Full Tilt IPA;Port Washington, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Harbor City Brewing Company;Had on tap at a restaurant in Madison. The beer was okay, but the aroma was all pee and the flavor was much too bitter.

Quarryman Tangle Foot;Berea, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;Probably the best real ESB I’ve had outside of England. Crisp, caramel color and just the right aroma. Do I sense Styrian Goldings? Perhaps a bit of EKG in the nose?
Quarryman Tangle Foot;Berea, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;medium to light brown color. nice, slightly thick body. this started off well, the malt and hop were battling it out, but at the end, i was left with an odd, somewhat metallic hop flavor.
Quarryman Pale Ale;Berea, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;From my long lost notes. On tap at the Quarryman, July, 2003. Served in a pint glass. Arrived at the table gold with a thin white head. Moderate carbonation. Light indistinct aroma. Flavor was pretty standard fare for a pale ale. Nothing special.
Quarryman Sodog IPA;Berea, Ohio, United States;IPA;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;This is an amazingly palatable beer with just-right bitterness, citrus notes, and a soft, quenching mouthfeel. Finish is dry and bitter just like it should be. This is an iconic beer and a damn good one, at that.
Quarryman Maple Porter;Berea, Ohio, United States;Porter;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;very good & tasty! Nice body & authority. sweet but not too. Good with pizza!
Quarryman Maple Porter;Berea, Ohio, United States;Porter;Quarryman Taverne & Brewery;yum. thick and oh, so sweet. the maple syrup really comes thru strong. just enough hops at the end to keep it from getting cloying, but I probably still wouldn't want more than 2 of these in a row.
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Bottle from old backlog notes. Pours a clear amber color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have a basic malt profile, caramel, doughy bread, light fruit, herbal, thin and watery.
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Aroma and flavor is sweetish malts, mild tea and not quite enough hops/bitterness.
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);A bit of a milestone beer for me since this is the 1500 beer rating from the US. I picked this beer because it isn’t the first beer I ever tried, but it is the first beer I ever truly enjoyed, when I had my first experiences with beer at the age of 21. I know. I started the beer thing late. Pours a clear copper color. Appropriately. Super smooth, easy drinking. Light body. I’ve always enjoyed this beer, and after a 2 year hiatus of trying this, I still enjoy it. Probably my favorite Red Hook brew, though a lot of that is owed to sentimental value.
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass and a mug at different times and there was barely any difference between the two glasses. The appearance was a nice hazy but clear amber color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated gently into the beer leaving some light slightly clingy lacing. The smell had some light sweet caramel malts. The taste took those malts and added a gentle crisp hop bitterness. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat smooth. Overall, not a bad beer just not generally a go to for me.
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);The body has a dark golden almost coppery color with good clarity. On top an aggressive pour produced a tall foamy white head. It has good retention and makes some sticky lacing on the glass. There is a sweet candy like malts with notes of brown sugar and some herbal hops of in the distance. It has a candy like character with hints of caramel, brown sugar and white bread. Hop bitterness is mild and adds some spicy/herbal notes to the mix. The hops come out a little more towards the finish and give some more balance to the sweet malt up front. It has a medium body, soft carbonation and a smooth texture.
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);"Appearance: no surprise, it is a copper colored ale. Pours about a 1 1/2"" head that dissipates rapidly leaving moderate lacing. Moderate carbonation. Aroma: mild aroma, smell of toasted grains and sweet malt Mouthfeel: mouthfeel is watery and carbonated. Sweetness predominates but there is some mild hop to balance it. Finish is semi-dry. Flavor: flavor is consistent throughout with a blend of malt and hops. Overall: I really enjoy Copperhook and recommend it if you like session ales, Copper/Red ales, or if your palate runs more towards malt than hops."
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);355ml bottle. Pretty standard fare, this. Went down easy, pleasant taste, refreshing. Much like their pils, this was a good mealtime table beverage, rather than a sensory experience. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Starts tasty and finishes to weakness.

Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Bottle. This is a pretty generic amber ale without a lot going for it. Fine for partys and cookouts.
Redhook CopperHook Spring Ale;Woodinville, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Redhook Brewery (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Pours a decent medium amber I wouldn’t call it copper. Aroma is that of cooked tomatoes barely registers and aroma. Taste has a slight bubblegum aspect if you really cycle some air through it while in your mouth. All around almost flavourless with a hint of bitter aftertaste... but not much. Fades to nothing after swallowing. Overall would be good to chug after a hard days work. Nothing offensive, but nothing worth praise either.
Bluegrass White Wedding Ale;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Draft at the Keg Liquors Fest of Ale. I was really pleased that David, the brewmaster at BBC brought this beer back out again. Pours a cloudy yellow with a full white head. Excellent lacing. The aroma is full of yeast and wheat. The flavor is excellent, with the coriander really coming through. A truly authentic version of this style.

Long sweet finish with some dried fruits and molasses. Maybe a touch of bitterness in the far back. It probably has it’s use, but I can’t see what it is. Still, it’s a flavorful one, but almost sickingly sweet. (081213)

Saranac Light;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Strictly from memory. This was a decent shot at a light lager, but fell short on everything as usual. However, it had street credit from that kayaker on the label.

Saranac Light;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Appearance: clear, honey gold color, kind of pretty and appealing, head is a treat for the eye, too, bubbly, snow white, leaving a little lace, slowly simmering. After that, it’s all downhill. Nose is nothing, though I searched and searched, my nostril aflared...nothing bad, anyway... As for taste; a tiny hop drizzle appears for 1/1,000,000th of 1 second that fades away...body doesn’t exist...in fact, it stands as the very hallmark of negligibility! There are small specs of flavor here and there, very small, and not enough to merit the term ""flavorful"" as it appears on the label. I don’t understand the existence of this type of beer, though the majority of Americans seem to take them to their collective bosom. It’s even more mysterious when a small brewery or a craft brewer farts one of these things out."
Saranac Light;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle: Light straw colored with a large white head. Almost no aroma, and a barely discernable malt flavoring in the taste. Very watered down....just like I’d expect from a pale lager. I guess it’s better than coors or bud.
Saranac Light;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;why would anyone really make a LIGHT beer, or, for that matter, and why would they rate it?? It is ok, much better then standard lights, but, maybe next week it will low carb crap also.
Saranac Light;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Pours straw colored, with good head. Flavor is watery, with some sweetness. Finish is slightly astringent. Not bad for a light. This light is far better than Bud, Coors, and Millers regular beers.

Saranac Light;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Not too bad of a light beer, but still watery. There is some actual malt flavor in there, and there are no foul off-flavors that are so common in many of the macro-brewed lites. Still pales in comparison to Sam Adams Light.

Faiseurs de Bière Cromlech;Goumoens-la-Ville, Switzerland;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Faiseurs de Bière;Bottled ((9.4 % ABV) Thanks Bov! Bottle cap mentions Oct 2006). Hazy ambery brown colour with mediumsized head, that turns into a small one quite quickly. Aroma is strong plum, toffee, fruits, alcohol and mild woodenness. As it turns warmer the aroma goes a bit oxidized. Flavour is wood, bread, spices, yeast and ends in a very smooth toffeeish raisiny way. Warming up it turns toffeeish all the way through. The finish is quite much plumpudding mixed with wood, nectar and raisins. Quite crisp carbonation makes this one a rather slow-to-drink beer.
Faiseurs de Bière Cromlech;Goumoens-la-Ville, Switzerland;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Faiseurs de Bière;Hazy amber colored, ultra fast dying head. Sharp in the aroma. Malt, toffee, fruit and some alcohol present. Fruit and anise flavor with a sharp citrus note and some orange and pineapple also. Good taste but not very balanced. Hides the high ABV well.

Bardo El Jefe Hefeweizen;Amissville, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);Strong aroma of esthers (banana). Fuller bodied then typical. No detectable hops and very wheaty. Interesting beer but not for me.
Bardo El Jefe Hefeweizen;Amissville, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);This was one of the first hefes I ever tried, and it gave me my first experience with the banana flavor the style carries. Unfortunately, this one's so strong on the banana that i've never had any desire for a refill. Nevertheless, it's a beer I've certainly enjoyed in a single serving.
Bardo Vincent Black Shadow Beer;Amissville, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);"argo0 sums it up perfectly, a ""repro of a standard american macro"". Need I say more?"
Bardo Vincent Black Shadow Beer;Amissville, Virginia, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);Good repro of a standard american macro. I've never understood why microbreweries have felt any compulsion to attempt to duplicate that which the regular swill-drinker can find anywhere. Guess it's so the beer snobs don't have to leave their friends behind when they go out for the good stuff. Bleah!
Bardo Marion Berry Lambic;Amissville, Virginia, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);Average and watery, with some berry and big chunks of yeast. hazy red pour with puffy head and lacing. Light tangy finish. Tap at waterfront palace.
Bardo Marion Berry Lambic;Amissville, Virginia, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);Ahh, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. My wife and I went on one of our first dates at Bardo back in 1997. Only weeks before that, however, that’s where I watched my Jayhawks take a beat down from Arizona, the eventual tournament winner. I was devastated. I also vaguely remember drinking beer there. This one, though, I remember quite well. Partially because the name was so damn brilliant. Partially because the beer was gloriously delicious the first time I had it. Partially because when I went back for the next batch it was so disgustingly awful. I guess that’s what happens when you play with wild yeast -- sometimes you win and sometimes you lose, particularly when the people involved probably had no idea what they were doing. The first batch -- the delicious one -- was a God’s-honest-truth lambic: earthy, complex, yeasty, tart. And with just the right amount of fruit. The second time, well, who knows what they had done. It basically tasted like alcoholic Kool-Aid -- no tasty, tarty funk, just sweet fake fruit. Maybe this is why Bardo didn’t make it? Seemed like they had some serious quality control issues. My ratings are for the good version. That’s how I want to remember Marion Berry.
Bardo Marion Berry Lambic;Amissville, Virginia, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);It seems as if they had trouble with this one. The beer was almost like an 'ade'. Too fruity with no other flavors detected. It smelled kind of nice though.

Bardo Dillons Extra Special Bitter;Amissville, Virginia, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bardo Brewing (Amissville);A forgettable ESB. Bardo did much better with the american style ales. Very weak aroma and flavor. Low carbonation but not pulled from a firkins as it should be. Of course back in the days when this was available it was impossible to find beer on cask in the states.
Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Draft at Dremo’s. Poured out a reddish brown, with red highlights at the edges. Off white head, somewhat soapy. Aromas are of roasted malts, more a weak stout than a brown ale. Flavors are of roasted malts, yeasty bread, some biscuit malts. Hops are present, but subdued. Thin body and mouthfeel. Hid the alcohol well.

Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Draft at Dremos. Dark brownish color, with small creamy head. Aromas of roasted nuts with a hint of chocolate. Perhaps like most SBC beers they can be hit or miss, I thought this one was really great.
Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Bottle... Cloudy, burnt orange ale with a small, frothy, off-white head. Good retention. Roasted notes of pecans, chocolate and maple syrup in the nose. Also, a bit phenolic (bandage). Thin, lightly acidic, gently bitter flavor. Terrific balance, but bland. Light-bodied with a fairly crisp finish. Thanks to growler for sharing the bottle!
Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Tap at SB Co. - Rusty brown, thin white creamy head. Soft floral nose with roasty, nutty, and chocolate undertones. Flavor was similar with earthy hop notes to boot. Light to medium bodied, light carbonation, drying, nutty, mild chocolate finish. Drinkable, but nothing special...
Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Gosh, I’m going to go against the grain. Hazy, moderate nut brown color, another beer of theirs that comes out undercarbonated, though it just so happens that I don’t think that’s a problem--it’s nice relief from most American beers in bars (including brewpubs) that are way too overcarbonated. I liked the basic flavor components, nutty, some suggestion of hops peeking through, caramel, and candy. Quite satisfying. (on tap at Dr. Dremos, Arlington, VA)
Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Brown. Nose is quite sweet. Good malts, caramel and peat, some molasses as well. Mildly hoppy at the end.
Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Light brown and opaque. Aroma is very sweet molasses. Flavor is molasses, raisins, and a hint of chocolate.
Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Setting: Served on tap at Dr. Dremo’s in a pint glass. Appearance: Clear medium brown topped by a smallish light tan head that dissipates to a scanty film and wee ring after a few sips. No lacing at all. Aroma: Light bready malts, faint whiffs of anise and candi sugars. Flavor: Sweetish caramel malts with a modicum of hoppy bitterness. Mild toasted malt flavors, too. Palate: Light to medium in body with short-lived aftertastes. Overall: Eh, this ain’t too bad, but there are better beers available at the place where you can get this, among them Brooklyn’s Brown Ale.
Dr. Dremos James Brown Ale;Alexandria, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Shenandoah Brewing Company;Slightly hazy brown colour with a thin tan head! Aroma of soap, strong nuts and a fair amount of malt! Tastes of malt, nuts and a fair amount of sugars. Aftertaste shows some bananas and subtle maltiness with predominiant malt. Overall, a better than average brown-impressive for someone who doesn't like the style! I bought this twelve ounce bottle at Shenandoah Brewing Company in Alexandria, Virginia and sampled it on 21-November-2003.

Aspen Meadow Nut Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Had on 8/18/2000. Aroma is a lightly roasted malt scent. Color is a deep golden brown with good carbonation and head. Taste is crisp and nutty. Starting with a light body that goes down with a crisp feel. Finish is a clean roasted malt flavor backed by a light bitterness. Its a nice little Brown Ale.

Aspen Meadow Nut Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"Clear copper, thin white head. Graham cracker aroma, pus some mild understated hints of plum.

Aspen Meadow Nut Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Thin brown color with a small, fleeting head. Yeasty aroma. Flavor is cola-like sweet carbonic acid tang, thin body. Below average.
Aspen Meadow Nut Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Not too great. Poured dark brown with minimal head which evaporated almost as fast as I could pour the bottle. Slight lacing along the way. Aroma was just barely there. I thought it was lacking in carbonation. Flavors which included some maltiness were very slight and a watery body. I don't like this anywhere near as much as Aspen's Red or Pale Ale. A dissappointment to say the least. I'll drink the rest of the sixpack, but won't buy another of this one
Aspen Meadow Nut Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Deep brown with a very light tan head. Malty caramel aromas with a nuttiness. Flavors of caramel and a little nutty. A bad metallic flavor and grainy. I would not drink this one again.
Aspen Meadow Nut Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Tastes slightly nutty with a very noticable sweet, vanilla-like flavor. It's not bad but really doesn't seem enough like a beer to me.

Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;Dusted chocolate aroma. Dark chocolate on palate. Well balanced. Very impressed. Beer has obviously improved since 2005.
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;Bottle -- Small, creamy light brown head with a bit of retention and lacing. Vary dark brew with active carconation when seen with a strong light behind it. Aroma of caramel and dark chocolate with a bit of a roasted edge. Palate is fairly thin but with a bit of creaminess and quite a lot of carbonation. More roasted, if not burnt, flavours in the taste. Almost really good.
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;"Dark, but not opaque, with a reasonably sized, frothy, lasting head that left some lace. Aroma contains some roasted grain notes rounded out with atouch of toffee. Very dry roasted bitterness which isn’t well integrated at all, but is otherwise ok. The palate is where all of Holgate’s beer have let me down so far (all in bottle). This one is fizzy like soda water, and it froths up as soon as it hits the mouth. It’s thin bodied, and the fizz creates an overly aggressive bite on the tongue. Admittedly it’s probably the worst time of the year to drink this beer, but it took a bit of an effort. Maybe they don’t bottle well, or they were too hot during travel - maybe I’ll give them another chance one day ;-)"
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;"Reading some of the ratings I was prepared for a gusher and that is what I got. Poured into a large chalice to take the exorbitant flurry of bubbles that rose a 2"" dense tan head that formed, lasted and laced rings down the glass. The body of beer a deep cola brown and almost opaque. Overall an impressive looking beer once it settled. Dry chocolate and vinous red-wine aroma with a little herbal and grassy hops. A little biting in carbonation in the mouth at first but this waned quickly and became quite smooth once it warmed to room temperature. Cocoa powder, roasted grain and the doughy, bready yeast found in most Holgate beers, with a light vinous and almost puckering note in the back that borderlined on astringent, Finish is reasonably long and dry with a mix of cocoa and dark malts. Very simple, and yet easily sessionable winter ale. It would be nice if the amps were turned up a little but otherwise it wasn’t that bad a drop. Quite nice. (33cL, age unknown)"
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;330 ml bottle. Very dark brown, almost black beer. Deep herbal and musty aroma. Coffee and chocolate mingle with dusty yeast. Flavour is quite thin though, toffee, coffee, and chicory. Slightly herbal.
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;A pretty good beer. I was surprised to find it scored so low. Poured out a dark brown with a small white head. Great roasted aroma and flavour. With some coacoa and a nice hit of hops on the finish. I got faint hints of dark frutiness as well. One fo the better beers I’ve had since arriving in Australia.
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;"A nice little winter warmer. Dark brown with a very large foamy head (had to break up the pour into quarters while waiting for the head to settle). Cozy aromas of roasted malt, woodsmoke, and coffee. The palate delivers the same. Looking at other reviewers comments, there seems to be a problem with overcarbonation, but I didn’t find this to be the case-- probably because I ""deflated"" it during the pour."
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;Bottled. Opening this bottle was a mess. It sprayed itself all over my room and my computer, leaving less than half the beer in the bottle. What was left poured hazily nut browned and very lively. It was roasty and nutty with some Belgian style almondy yeast characetr. It was well balanced with medium sweetenss and medium bitterness. Besides the fiasco upon opening the beer, it was a quite enjoyable experience.
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;Hopelessly over-carbonated Australian strong ale. Shame because there may be a decent beer lurking under those suds. Poured a cloudy bottle-conditioned teak colour with a surging tan head. Looks extremely frisky for a winter ale, which raises doubts before I’ve sniffed or tasted. Clumpy lace. Porter-like sweet aroma of dry cocoa powder and chocolate. God this is fizzy. First mouthful is all foam. I guess you’d call the mouthfeel lively and it’s all wrong for the style. Flavour also porter-like - dominated by dark malt, with a dry chocolatey finish.
Holgate Brewhouse Winter Ale;Woodend, VIC, Australia;Porter;Holgate Brewhouse;Lovely alcohol/smoky/coffee aroma promised so much. Kind of tasted like a thin porter, bit of chocolate maltyness but not a lot else, has a slight warming effect but there really is nothing special.
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;Dull copper coloured body with a small head and some lacing. Cascade hops very light in taste and a little bit oily. Decent looking brewbar now they just need some decent brews to go along with it.
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;Slightly cloudy gold colour, pineapple aroma, with resiny, pine flavour, dry malt, with a thin finish. Seems like consistency is a problem for this brewer.
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;Draught at AIBA, Melbourne. Clear deep golden, small creamy head. Grapefruit aroma. Dry, really hoppy and salty with clean, hard, primitive malt profile and a strikingly bitter, near inky finish. A brave but rather unrefined example of the style.
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;I had this with a great steak at the Gunn Island Pub. It was great and I feel that it will impress some of you beer afficinados if you can get to it. It had good colour, aroma and palate and tasted a little bit too hoppy. I will buy it again definately.
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;"I’ve had this a few times previously and it was never very good (including one phenolic infection), but this time it was pretty good. Aroma is malty like vanilla ice cream with caramel topping. Flavour is caramel malty, with quite a solid bitterness. Certainly not enough hop flavour or aroma to be an IPA but pretty nice nonetheless. (7/4/7/3/13) RR: Has dropped the ""Cut Snake"" from its name. Vaguely like an APA but mostly just thin, metallic and soulless. Vague lambic quality. My mate asked why a beer like this would taste so much like VB - I couldn’t really answer him. Nothing like the last time I had it. Looking at my previous rating I’d say the time it was good was the anomaly, so I’m adjusting the numbers accordingly."
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;Dryish. Pleasant cow manure aroma. Perhaps too watery with some adjuncts. Typical Aussie pale.
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;every brewery seems to be trying to make one of these nowadays - little creatures more or less. plenty of cascade in there and soft in a dull way. still, a pleasant antidote to metallic lagers
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;Consumed at Kiribilli hotel (under the Sydney Harbour Bridge on the north side). A good IPA with presentable hop presence. The aroma was slightly cardboardy and agreeably herbaceaous on warming. At least they are trying to brew a traditional beer.
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;At AIBA 2003. Nice amber body with floral hop aroma. Thick and sweet with a sour citrus finish in which some alcohol was evident. Not much real bitterness but I liked it.
Gunn Island Cutsnake Pale Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;IPA;Gunn Island Brewbar;I would have to agree with duff on all his points. This beer could be anyone of 100 run of the mill beers out there at the moment
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;Proper amber body with a poor head. Boring caramel once again also grainy but nothing in it to really turn you on.
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;Draught at AIBA, Melbourne. Brownish amber, small head. Peach is obviuos in the nose. Sweet with clean, straightforward mouthfeel and low hop rate. A pretty mediocre ale that passes by unnoticed at a beer festival.
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;Now known as simply Gunn Island Amber Ale. Fairly dark with decent head retention. Berries and toast aroma - quite plain. Burnt toast flavour and not much of anything else. A touch of roast. Boring as batshit. Pale ale with food colouring? (I must’ve been in a bad mood when I rated these)
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;Not bad. A hint of smoked malt and beef. Englishy hops, decent balance. One of the better beers at nfob.
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;nfob03. this had the orange mango cordial aroma that i like in amber ales. quite a dark amber, thin body, sweet aftertaste
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;This ABV is always a bit of an enigma. It is great as a basis for a good beer provided the beer is going to have a fine balance of hops and malt. I agree with the commercial description but for the lack of comment on bitterness. Look, in Australia we need to support this effort.
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;At AIBA 2003. A darker brow brew lacking aroma, mallty, nutty and fairly bitter in flavour. Quite watery though.
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;Beautiful color and pour. Tastes of toffee and malts, with subtle floral notes. Excellent micro brewery drop!
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;This is a beer made better by the fantastic brewpub it comes from. Lots of malt, unsurprisingly.
Gunn Island Ducks Nuts Amber Ale;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;Had a nice flowery to fruity aroma, flavour was malty but not bitter in aftertaste. Wish they bottled the stuff.
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;Red and orange in body with an off-white head. Much better head poured but hardly lasting and less lacing, some caramel in the taste followed by light lemon hops, none of the advertised spice. Not lager offensive.
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;Draught at AIBA, Melbourne. Amber colour, small head. Strawberry aroma. The mouthfeel is primitively clean and hard. There’s notes of peach and only low bitterness. I couldn’t find much that caught my interest in this beer.
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;"Now known simply as ""Red Lager"". Nice fiery red colour. Head retention is OK. Sweaty yeast aroma with a fair dose of fruitiness and grassy hop. Seems like a couple more weeks of lagering would clear it up nicely. Firm Melanoidin maltiness, not sweet, with hop flavour at the end. Firm bitterness. Alcohol is evident. Seems quite bock-like. A bit rough but actually quite likeable."
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;On tap, aroma was just noticeable floral hop and a tiny amount of roastiness. Looks clear red/orange, nothing wrong with how it looks. Fairly mild toffee & a bit grainy giving way to a bitter aftertaste. Quite watery though refreshing.
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;Very polite Ale. To me it was little Belhaven-y. Some tartan underpants: I don't understand what style this is.
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;nfob03. looks pretty orange for a red beer. for all the effort that the commercial description suggests that they put in, this still tastes very extracty, it's unfizzy and dull and tastes of porridge. but it is smooth and drinkable
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;At AIBA 2003. A dark amber beer. Very swwet aroma and flavour without much hop contribution. I must agree with the others though, extra points for quick drinkability.
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;Sweet and Peachy is the best way to describe this beer. Very easy to drink, low on the hops as well.
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;I found this to be my favorite of the lot in their stable. Nice full flavour and I agree with duff, easy to drink....by the pint.
Gunn Island Shot Fox Red Beer;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gunn Island Brewbar;Pretty tame. Not much aroma (perhaps a bit of sweetish malt aroma), a bit sweet at the start, and finishes very quickly, little or no hop presence, easy to drink.
Gunn Island Mothers Milk;Middle Park , Victoria, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Gunn Island Brewbar;Pretty flavourless and edgy, bit of spice, but pretty below average. probably my least favourite of there brews.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Bottle- Pours a dark amber color with a decent tan head that fades to some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, nuts and a hint of caramel sweetness. Taste of roasted malt with some caramel sweetness and a bit of nut flavor in the background. Mild bitterness and a clean finish. Medium body, smooth with a decent balance. Fairly average brown ale but still good for a couple.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;From a 330ml bottle on 14/8/2011.Pours a very cloudly dark amber with almost no head. Has quite a distinct caramel toffee malt aroma. More caramel and toffee sweetness is evident in the flavour, but the most prominent feature is a strong almost burnt, roasty bitterness. Reading the other reviews on here makes me wonder whether I’m drinking the same beer. A good ale with quite a bit of character.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Tap. Nutty, brown sugar on the nose. Thin to medium mouth feel. Good caramal/ nut body with a soft finish. Good easy drinker.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Bottle from Warners at the Bay. Pours a clear copper/brown with a small beige head. Aroma was a light roasted caramel and toffee. Taste was a slightly hop and nut combo, with a light roasted flavour. Not very impressive, but drinkable i suppose.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Thick brown colour, with a small beige head that dissapears quickly. Roasted toffee elements to the aroma, which follow through to the flavour. Roasted flavour lasts to the after taste. Plesant beer.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Bottle. Pours copper with a large fluffy beige head that settles to an inch. High bead. Very modest aroma of a little cereal and caramel. Taste has some crystal malt sweetness and a fair bit of spicy hop bitterness. Spicy finish. The malt’s a little simple and subdued and there’s too much carbonation, but it’s OK.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Lovely mahogony color. Huge head. Filled the whole glass very quickly. Not much on the aroma front. Perhaps a little malt but not much else. Tasted of a little malt and a little yeast though overall very bland. Good mouthfell. A little fizzy and some malt sweetness. OK . A bit lacking with not much happening at all.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Big frothy head tinge of fawn in it decent carbonation red brown colour ale,aroma caramel,toffee fruit hoppy.Flavour caramel mild toffee hoppy bitter fruity taste of pear and apple,well put together ale finish good malt and hop tastes,bitter sweet.
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Melbourne, Australia Bottled Brown sugar malltiness - some roast notes but mostly sweet Bitterness too low
Jamieson Brown Ale;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Brown Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Little aroma at all. Minimal head that dissipated almost immediately. Strong malty flavours which are balanced well by the bitterness. A decent session beer.
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Good on them for doing a beer of this style. Wouldn’t it ihave been great if it actually tasted like the style. murky, mudy stagnant, this has more in commmon with a pond than beer. Evrything about the beer is unexciting
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;"Wow, people really beat the crap out of this beer! I quite liked it, thought it my favourite out of the Jamieson selections that I tried. Pours a dark brown with medium head that doesn’t last very long. Roasty malt aroma with some fruity tones, all of which carry over on the palate. No real criticism from me, I quite liked it. I agree that it doesn’t really fit what I might expect of a ""dark wheat"", but good nontheless."
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;I don’t know why they bother to make this beer and a brown ale, very similar they are. Sweet malt, aroma of carbon dioxide (overcarbonated). No character.
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;apart from a slightly flat mouth feel, this beer is quite nice with great burnt malts and enough bitternes to balance but not overpower.
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;"I think this is now called the Mountain Ale? Medium chocolate brown, pours a good fizzy head early but settles fairly quickly. Sweet chocolate malt on the nose. Pretty good in the mouth; more chocolate malts round the profile out nicely. Fizzy finish. Lacks a bit of seriousness but a fairly decent effort. A much lighter beer than the ’old’ version and IMHO a better drink."
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;I normally like wheat beers, but I wouldn’t classify this as such. Very little taste and head retention was extremnely poor. Not bad, but not great.
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Bottled whilst at Paddy’s Brewpub, Flemington, Australia. Thoughts on this beer retained for rating purposes…[Thought to self] Spiesy what do you think of this beer? [Noted replies to self] ‘Not much, it sucked’ The gathering: duff, eczematic, motelpogo, Spiesy, Sully and late arrival Linc.
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;"awful. clear brown. syruppy, incredibly sweet and not wheaty at all, with a thin, dirty extract tang. ugh. rer8: this was under the name of ""jamieson mountain ale"" but i think is the same beer cause it said it was a ""dark wheat beer"" in the label blurb. so i didnt even get a new rating out of this, damn. the best i can say about this beer is that it’s not infected. murky red-brown, almost completely aroma-less but what there is is dust, POR, thin toast. taste is strawberry jam on burnt toast then an extremely quick nothing-dry finish with some sourness."
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Dark brown colour with a light brown head, retention low and little lacing. Smooth chocolate taste but not real full flavours. Aroma is malty caramel.
Jamieson Dark Wheat;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;Wheat Ale;Jamieson Brewery;Pours clear brown with amber tinges. Sudsy off white head, ok retention. Med-high carbonation. Caramel dominates aroma, with some roast malt there too. Medium mouthfeel, reasonably smooth start though finish a little thin. Pretty bland and innofensive taste. Sweet malty start with a clean choc malt finish. No yeastiness, no flavours I normally associate with a hefe. Alright beer though.
Bells Hotel Summer Lager;South Melbourne, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bells Hotel and Brewery;like an aussie attempt at a south-east asian lager. quite ricy and dry and golden. some sulphur in the aroma is a bit of a worry
Bells Hotel Summer Lager;South Melbourne, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bells Hotel and Brewery;like a bad heineken attempt. odd sulfur stench like it hasnt been lagered enough, or at all. yellow, very sweet, slightly grainy.
Bells Hotel Summer Lager;South Melbourne, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bells Hotel and Brewery;Pretty bland lager, i guess this one is meant to appeal to a wide range of people, not a stand out, no real malt or hop character, no body.
Bells Hotel Real Ale;South Melbourne, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bells Hotel and Brewery;Light passionfruity aroma. Tea red coloured. Lots of hoppy notes but I think their was some malt showing through.
Bells Hotel Real Ale;South Melbourne, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bells Hotel and Brewery;At AIBA 2003. Cloudy bronze with fresh hoppy aroma. Some malt at first but mostly has a big bitter hoppy kick at the end.
Bells Hotel Real Ale;South Melbourne, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bells Hotel and Brewery;Big hoppy and malty nose, very zesty, citrusy and fruity, nice malt middle, and very satisfying hop finish, this beer really agreed with me.
Bells Hotel Best Bitter;South Melbourne, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bells Hotel and Brewery;a closer approximation to a bitter than their other one. slightly funny metallic/citric tang but drinkable enough
Bells Hotel Best Bitter;South Melbourne, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bells Hotel and Brewery;syruppy, fruity like one of those cream cheeses with chunks of apricot in em. showed some promise but was too tangy.
Bells Hotel Best Bitter;South Melbourne, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bells Hotel and Brewery;A nice little bitter, very nice bitterness and maltiness, not as goo as their real ale, but still a decent little brew. Thumbs up.
Bells Hotel Irish Stout;South Melbourne, Australia;Stout - Dry;Bells Hotel and Brewery;There is a real need for the brew team to lok at the definition of a stout. No hint of roastiness in the flavour and there is such a soft mouthfeel that it is merely a dark beer of questionable substance.
Bells Hotel Irish Stout;South Melbourne, Australia;Stout - Dry;Bells Hotel and Brewery;not very stout like. dark purple, not particularly roasty and quite thin. had a decent lingering thin head. otherwise pretty funny - hints of orange and garbage juice
Bells Hotel Irish Stout;South Melbourne, Australia;Stout - Dry;Bells Hotel and Brewery;damn, i hate disagreeing with duff but i'm going to have to again. this wasn't even close to black, more like dark red. watery, flabby, thin mouthfeel, with vague burnt flavour overwhelmed by banana/celery/DMS with off cordial aftertaste. tasted a bit off, like another of their beers. maybe after the grand final wasn't the best time to try em.
Bells Hotel Irish Stout;South Melbourne, Australia;Stout - Dry;Bells Hotel and Brewery;I actually had this again about 6 months ago and totally forgot to re-rate it. It was definitley not as good as i had remembered. Much thinner this time. Sweetish, with some burnt roastyness in the finish, still not totally bad. Drinkable.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;Pours dark amber with a quickly fading head. Nose shows DMS, soft sweet malt, cidery notes and faint nutty malt. Better flavours. More prominent nutty malt and some spicy hops. Still a faint cidery note though. Body feels a bit watery.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;330 ml bottle Nice golden colors good aroma can taste hoppy flavour although not overpowering ok not great
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;From a 330ml bottle on 16/4/2011. Pours a murky golden orange colour, with lots of yeast sediment floating about. The aroma is fruity and yeasty. Goes down quite nicely, with citrus fruits combining with caramel malt. Has a pretty decent dash of hops at the end. A pretty good English pale.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;330ml bottle. Big fluffy dirty san dcoloured head a top a hazy light copper base. Floral hop aromas and a big bang of flavour hits the mouth, hops again. Balance is spot on and the finish is how you want it.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;Bottle 330ml. Not bad. Aroma is floral, with a hint of caramel. Sweet taste, with light bitterness. Oily palate, and thin-to-medium body. Yellow, with a frothy white head.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;My favourite of the buckleys variety, deep gold appearance with residual cloudyness present. Fruity ale displaying some tart in the finish. Decent.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;Original?- maybe ordinary.Straw coloured body, poor head, fruity hop taste but still pretty boring, it is an ale but that is about all, doughy aroma, sour soft grapefruit taste. Looking at previous ratings I must have got a crook batch.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;Looks great in the glass, big white head with very good retention and lacing. Small floral aroma. As said before, carbonation is spot on, the dry malty flavours come though nicely, combined with a light bitterness and a very very clean finish. Great hop profile, one of the best Victorian beers i’ve tasted.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;Amber colour, light malty aroma with some orange character. Orange zest and grapefruit flavours compliment a light malty palate, a distinct acidity makes for an unusually clean, refreshing finish. A little light on the body but not bad overall.
Buckley's Original Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Yarra Flats Brewery;Much better than previous efforts. Genuine english pale ale / bitter traits here with a very good creamy structure. Indeed, had I only smelt and not tasted I would have unreservedly picked this as English. Slighlt metallic ping in the back palate. The best of the house.
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;330 mil bottle malty aroma dark amber sort of a malty beer its ok but would not buy again
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;Pours dark amber with a small off-white head. Nose shows spices, some nutty malt, subtle sweet malt and corn-like DMS notes. Pretty restrained. Restrained flavours too. Some bready malt and grainy notes alongside faint spicy hops. Body feels watery.
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;Bottle 330ml, present from my gf. Interesting malty nose. Aroma is vinous, with nuts, and floral hints. Taste is sweet, with average length. Palate is oily, and medium bodied. Amber, with a frothy head.
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;330ml bottle. Deep fluffy dirty white head that rises like bread in an oven. Ruby copper flecked cloudy beer that looks good. Biscuity caramel aroma that gets your attention. Full of flavour and fills the mouth and then leaves a lingering warmth on the palate. Yet another good effort from the boys at Yarra Flats.
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;"Like the worst kind of home brew. Rancid in such a familiarly unsettling and seemingly unsterile way that as you grimace with displeasure, it makes you think ""oh well, at least it’s free"", and then you remember that amazingly it so isn’t."
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;Bottled, Amber colouring throughout the body, fizzy light head. Bitterness strongly felt through the palate along with a slight nutty flavour reminiscent of a heavier beer variety (ie. Amber Ale). Decent locally grown beer, still slightly rough though.
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;Medium amber body with a slight off-white head, hardly lasting. Caramel aroma along with hops, fuggles & tettnanger show up in the taste, resin, like it better than the bells hotel bitter but it is still one-dimensional, almost like an IPA.
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;Pours a deep cloudy copper, with a large fluffy off white head. Poor lacing. Pretty typical aroma, but a bit yeasty. Fuggles are evident in the palate, plenty of earthy flavours and a hint of friutiness. Also some nice (slightly sweet) maltiness. Not too bad really
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;Pours a pretty good foam head with good form and decent lacing. Dark orange, almost light brown in colour. Good aroma lift but a fraction too citric and metallic for my liking. A little sweet citrus in the palate and does firm up at the back with some bitterness, but that citrus does thins out the flavour out somewhat.. Better than previous bottles &#402.3&#41.
Buckley's Bitter Ale;Healesville, Victoria, Australia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Yarra Flats Brewery;Aroma: hoppy, some sweetness and a bit lagery. Appearance: cloudy brown with a hint of orange. Small bubbly head. Flavour: some sweet malt with strong hop bitterness. A touch of grapefruit also noticeable.
Masthead Tawny Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Masthead Brewery;Looks pretty good like most dark beers but that's about it. Sugary aroma, faint simple burnt malt taste & a dry finish.
Masthead Tawny Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Masthead Brewery;Nice looking dark amber ale, a bit reddish, smells nicely malty, slightly roasted nice foamy head. Tastes is very roasted, almost too roasted for my taste. Still it's a good beer that i'll be drinking again when i can. Not great, but drinkable.
Masthead Tawny Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Masthead Brewery;Dark amber-red clear with medium size lasting pale beige head and some sporadic lace. Faint light roast malt aroma becoming sweeter as it warms. Medium sweet roast malt flavours with hint of toffee and coffee. Mild dry faint bitter finish. A touch on the thin side otherwise quite drinkable.
Masthead Tawny Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Masthead Brewery;According to my beer stained tasting notes this is 5.2%. Fairly malty,reasonable flavour. I'd drink it again.
Masthead Tawny Ale;Sanctuary Cove, Queensland, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Masthead Brewery;Ok, but a tad bit sugary like the rest of their brews, probably the best though.
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;12-Nov05 (Scottish Chiefs Brewery) - Very light fruit malt aroma. Clear amber colour with lowish head but good sheet lacing. Nice easy fruit flavour. Hoppy malt fruit finish but a bit thin.
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;Hop malt aroma with a hint of flowers. Clear amber colour with poor head and lacing. Light malt flavour with hops.
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;pretty much identical to the pale ale in appearance. its a lot sweeter though which equals i liked it better. not too interesting but some nice golden syrup flavour and minimal hops. quite ok. on tap at the labour in vain in melbourne.
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;Sampled AIBA 2004. Golden colour rather than amber. Light malt aroma and only slightly bitter. A beer to appeal to the mainstream palate that, as you see by my numbers, is decidedly average.
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;malty aroma, light golden amber colouration, malty with fruity hop sweetness, light bitterness.
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;Easily my least favourite Steampacket beer, and quite inconsistent, though there was one time I really enjoyed it. Caramelly, fruity aroma. Caramel malt sweetness, then a bit of metal, sourness and bitterness. Similar to Squire's Amber which I really don't like.
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;Not too interesting. An attempt at a flat inoffensive english ale that succeeded.
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;nfob03. pretty boring, bright orange, faint toffee, watery, not very exciting
Fitzroy Amber Ale;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;A decent little amber ale, well balanced, lightish, caramelly, slightly roasted, pretty good.

Fitzroy Porter;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;Kiwifruit! What an odd aroma for a porter. Chocolatey flavour balanced by a distinct acidic cleanliness. Very odd but very tasty nonetheless.
Fitzroy Porter;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;Served too cold at the nfob. Fruit salad and some seasame seeds hidden under cold water like shower water on menopause and don't think that isn't related to a pause with the men.
Fitzroy Porter;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;nfob03. i tasted a lot of tamarind in this. pitch black, pretty fruity, some instant coffee
Fitzroy Porter;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;(Also known as Stoker Ale) Tasted at the Cornish Arms in Brunswick, Vic. Quite clear, dark brown colour with thin, white head. Beautiful dark fruit (cherry/sultana), dark malt aroma with malty, chocolate flavour. Not much hop character but enough balancing bitterness.
Fitzroy Porter;Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia;Porter;Steampacket/Fitzroy Brewery;Pretty good little porter, lots of flavour, roasty chocolate and coffee flavours with a hints of berries.

Hanby Cascade;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Cask in Blackfriars. Aroma is biscuity sweet malts, notes of cascade lime character, grassy and gets floural as it growns. Taste is similar almost a slight candy sugar hint from the sweetness. Could do with double the cascade hops to be honest.
Hanby Cascade;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Cask conditioned - handpump - Brunswick Derby. A copper coloured beer with an off-white head. The aroma is orangey but there’s a disturbing phemolic edge. The taste is fruity and hoppy but a bit sweet. Certainly not much notes of cascade. A bit disappointing but manageable.
Hanby Cascade;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Cask handpull at Ship & Mitre, Liverpool. Copper/gold colour with thin beige head. I was expecting this to have lots of Cascade hops. Well it doesn’t. It might have a sprinkling though as it has some earhty citrus hops. These combine with a pleasant golden malty base beer. It’s fine, quite attractive, subtle hop finish. Quite good really as it had to win over my desire for huge Cascade hops.
Hanby Cascade;Wem, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wem Brewing;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. This was quite unusual: a dark golden beer with a small, off-white head. A curious sweet, spicy aroma, perhaps honeysuckle. Taste not so good: very sweet, slightly artificial cough candy taste with some incense wafting around somewhere. Virtually no bitterness.

Exe Valley Spring Beer;Exeter, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Exe Valley Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at Reading Beer Festival on 28 April 2011. Another clean and quite restrained golden ale. By which I mean it could benefit from upping the Cascade levels and reducing the good old Fuggles and Goldings. This sort of beer really needs a bit more zing than Fuggles & Goldings provide.

Marston's Double Drop (5%);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Aug 2008: Clear 500ml bottle drank at my brother-in-laws house well before the Best before date. Poured into a handled half litre glass mug from the JW Augustiner Munich tap house. Amber, copper colour with a white head that tried to stay around but failed and fell away to a wispy covering after about a minute. The aroma wasn’t very heavy, some sweet malted barley and hops, but not a great deal of either. Typical English Ale flavours, nothing to get excited about, even if it is ’Double Dropped’. The mouthfeel and texture of the beer was again ordinary and just like most British Bitters you can get cheap in any supermarket.

Marston's Double Drop (5%);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Marston's;Light amber-orange color. Quite heavily carbonated, with a nice, fine head. Strong aroma of hops and sulfur comes out immediately upon pouring-it is fruity, citrusy, a touch sweet. Very malty flavor, caramel. Quite sweet. But there is good hops in the taste from the beginning, and they come to predominate towards the finish and after. It is highly carbonated, light bodied. Lots of hops indeed. The finish has a touch or caramel malt but is mostly hoppy, and last a pretty long time. A nice beer, not completely original, but good.

CooperSmiths Columbine Kölsch;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;From May 2008 From my notes of April 19, 2008 I was in the mood for something light yet tasty so I ordered one, let's see how it fares: Nice clear golden colour with a 2 finger head of foam. Some lacing and the head retention was good. The nose is very light but I did get a malty smell but not much more.

Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;"From Dec 2006 2004 Vintage Poured from 12oz bottle(room temp) a clear reddish gold with a large head of foam that eases back some but remains as a solid layer throughout the session. Oh, and there's plenty of lacing. The smell has a huge nose of caramel malt with some hoppiness in the background. The taste is very sweet up front. Nice caramel and butterscotch followed closely by some some hop bitterness and a good sour fruit bitterness. Very complex and very warming! A good one to drink on this cold snowy day. The finish is semi sweet and something that ends the flavours in a positive way. A great sipper, I doubt I could drink another one of these right away but that's not saying anything negative about it. I want to stretch this glass out. ;^) Bottom line: I've held on to this bottle for a while now and it's quite the treat. I got a 2005 bottle waiting for me..maybe later today. Thanks to Nutbrown for providing both bottles in a past trade!"
Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;Bottle, rated February 2016. Hazy red with off white head. Roma of raisins and dates. Sweet flavour of Daim chocolate. Ummmm....
Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;"Bottled in 2005, embibed 2014.(bottle #42 of 500). Exquisite. Pours hazy chestnut with visible particulate. Probably could have been decanted. Bottle foamed on opening. Big fluffy head that subsided to thin layer of what looked like cream. Nose - big but soft, complex; chocolate, dried dark fruit, plum pudding. Flavor - follows the aroma and add licorice, the real licorice, and cream. Palate - beautifully textured on the tongue without being syrupy. Flavors start creamy and builds to the more robust flavors, then becomes an ethereal but lingering reminder of what came before. Phenomenal that a nine - ten year old brew has so much character."
Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;Bottle at a tasting in 2011 from notes. Pours a hazy orange/golden color with a small white head. The aroma and flavor has sweet caramel and brown sugar, a hint of tobacco, earthy notes and a slight hint of oxidation that promoted sherry notes. The alcohol is very well hidden which adds a point. This is the only time I’ve seen this beer, but would be interested in another taste.
Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;2011 vintage, 12 oz. bottle, sent from javit (thanks a lot, Adam). Pours a beautiful dark mahogany with a small beige head. Nose is very malty, with dark fruits, caramel malts, some mild candied sugar, and an herbal note. Flavour has lots of caramel malt sweetness, some toffee, feint dark fruits and loads of booze - there is definitely a big boozy burn on the finish, along with lots of sweetness. Somehow the sweetness is contained by the intense heat, almost making two wrongs a right, except that the heat is too much. Low complexity, dominated mostly by caramel sweetness and booze. Perhaps age would settle this, though older reviews seemed to indicate the same thing, so I couldn’t be bothered waiting. Decent sipper.
Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;Unclear amber body with a small offwhite head.

Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;Tiny sample from bottle after a long tasting. This one had a reputation of being past it’s prime but It was still worth a go. Pours hazy brown orange. Small beige head and light lace. Aromas and taste were strong vanilla, slight oxidized rust, bread, apples, and spice. Plenty of carbonation. Not bad just overshadowed by the others brews that night.
Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;Pours unclear amber in color with a decent light tan head. The aroma is light sweet malts typical of the style with a bit of the booziness there at the end. The flavor is not as huge as expected overwhelming in booze or sweet malts, the alcohol may have settled a bit over the year. It is palatable for sure with an ABV of 11.
Southampton Old Herb;Southampton, New York, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Southampton Publick House;Jeff pulled this beauty out of his cellar late night. 2006 vintage poured into a Stone IRS tulip. Pours a flat honey brown. It is completely translucent in clarity. Nose is hops, honey, and malt. Taste is rather pleasant, perfumery hops, smooth malts, and some caramel. Smooth mouthfeel, light booze, and a moderate finish. Nice barley wine for the age, would like to see what this guy tastes like fresh.

Valhalla Thors Wild Wheat;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Valhalla Microbrewery & Restaurant;This is one of my favorite wheat beers. The aroma is one of sweet malt and bananas. The flavor is all wheat with hints of fruit. But it is by no means a fruit type beer. I ty to stop in and have one when I'm in downtown Pittsburgh during the summer months. It is a very refreshing and very enjoyable beer. If you like wheats, this is a must try if you're in Pittsburgh.

J.T. Whitneys Triple Treat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Cloudy gold pour, small white head, no lace. Faint honey aroma. Flavor begins with a honeyed sweetness. The cereal backbone is very husky, and taste could go either way on whether that’s a good thing or not, a bit of an off sourness on the finish. Medium bodied, somewhat coarse mouthfeel from the carbonation.

J.T. Whitneys Triple Treat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;A little dissapointing feature from J.T. Whitney: pours a straw yellow colour with a small, thin white head. Aroma is a little odd- aromas of corn, stale hops and grain. Taste is off dry, tart midpalate finishes slightly watery.
J.T. Whitneys Triple Treat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;"Served on draught at the Wisconsin Micro-brewers Beerfest in Chilton, Wisconsin. Pours a clear golden pale blonde brew with a fast dissolving white head that dissipates clean. Aroma is very light with just a hint of crystal grain malt, a touch of citrus hops and some dry herbs. Taste is light bodied, a multi-personality grain flavor with some carbonation and citrus zest character. Finish is semi-dry, crisp and then disappears to a clean cut flavor. I would not mind trying this as a trivial beer, for a ""What am I?"" drinking session."
J.T. Whitneys Triple Treat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Sample @ brewery. Grainy aroma pale to say the least. Yellow body to the beer. Odd flavor for this one couldn’t even decide what it was. Well they had it on the beer list as a beer so you have to try it.
J.T. Whitneys Triple Treat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap It was hard to pick up anything from the golden colored body other than a vague sense of grains. There was a light carbonation but otherwise not much was happening in my glass. The taste was a bit more active with a combination of grains (primarily the barley), malt and not much else. A slight bitterness left itself on my tongue for a second before leaving virtually no trace. Overall this was decent and enjoyable but there was nothing about it that either stood out or made me want to try it again.
J.T. Whitneys Triple Treat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a Vitamin B-fueled fluorescent urine yellow with a little bit of white head. Funky veggies, random sweet malt, and corn in the nose. Flavor was of about the same stuff add some grains and a light bitterness. Tacky and unsatisfying on the palate... kinda felt like garbage juice slowly working its way over the tongue. This just wasn’t good on any front. Blech.
J.T. Whitneys Triple Treat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;Very light yellow color, no aroma to speak of light malt taste,slighter sweeter than a macro,but not bold enough to be anything more than a refresher. wheat and rye didn’t come through at all

Nodding Head BPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - Belgian;Nodding Head Brewery;Draft at Khyber Pass. Cloudy orange copper with a slim fizzy/foamy off-white lace that left a few splatters of lace. Juicy malty earthy citrus hop brew. Blood oranges. Passionfruit. Chanterelles. Mangos. Autumn leaves. Tangerine peels. Oak resins. Green tomatoes. Starfruit. Medium caramel malts are paired quite well here with the Cascade hops. Missed this when it was made at the original brewery years ago. I think it is brewed out of PBC at the moment.
Nodding Head BPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - Belgian;Nodding Head Brewery;Well-balanced and nice enough. Amber pour with ok head and lacing. Soft citrus, lots of surprising roast for something so light in colour. Light florals. Tap at brewpub.

Nodding Head Pilsener;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nodding Head Brewery;Golden color with a small white head. Rather bland aroma, but flowery hops were noticed. Overall the taste was balanced with sweet malts, and nice grassy hops. An overhopped, though enjoyable pilsener.
Nodding Head Pilsener;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nodding Head Brewery;Yuck. Clear yellow with a ring of head. Musty, dirty, Saaz aroma, with some hints of grape fruitiness. Aggressive attack on the palate. When I put it in the mouth I didn't want to swallow because I could sense what would come next: a hint of hops, lingering bitterness, and a mildly astringent aftereffect that sapped enjoyment from it. Nicely carbonated, at least. (on tap at brewpub)
Nodding Head Pilsener;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nodding Head Brewery;Light gold. Gives up its head fairly quickly. Fresh aroma. Nice spiciness. Usually I like a soft mouth feel but for a pilsener I could use something a bit more crisp.
Nodding Head Pilsener;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nodding Head Brewery;Light golden with a nice Saaz-type nose. Fruity and malty, much fruitier than I expect from a pilsner. Decent.
Nodding Head Pilsener;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nodding Head Brewery;Not nuts about this. It''s got a sweet bready flavor, and it''s nowhere near clean enough.

Nodding Head Pilsener;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Nodding Head Brewery;Hoppy, almost fruity nose. Nice light yellow with good head. Light carb, with nice body. Nicely hopped, bit sweet, clean finish. A bit too sweet for a pils, but very good.
Red Star Locomotive Breath;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Red Star Agave Grille;Golden color with a small head and not much carbonation.

Red Star Locomotive Breath;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Red Star Agave Grille;This was not one of the better offerings at the Red Star. Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a pale golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma was light, dry and vaguely hoppy. The texture was a bit thin and the flavor dry with a sharp hop bite that was vaguely spicy. There was a dry sharp hop aftertaste as well.
Red Star Locomotive Breath;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Red Star Agave Grille;Weak malty aroma. Golden amber color with small head. Moderate carb, watery. Hoppy and somewhat sweet with bitter after. It was OK, but I don't care if I have it again.

Thin lighter brown head. Leaves pretty good lace. Medium-plus body. Smooth, king of soft carbonation. Lightly dry in the finish. I know it’s a chocolate stout, but this is just too sweet for me.

Rocky River Oompa Loompa Chocolate Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Flavored;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);on tap at RRBC, this one had me the most excited without doing any prior research, its your average stout color but its ligther body coupled with very good carbonation makes this a treat, not much chocolate flavor mostly coffee dominated but i suspect the addition of the chocolate aids in the smooth taste.
Rocky River Oompa Loompa Chocolate Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Flavored;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Note: I got this beer on tap during Brew Week in Athens, Ohio. Pours a very dark brown with a caramel head. Smells more of a coffee roast than chocolate. It has a medium sweetness with a carbonated soda feel. I like that this stout has a refreshing quality due to the soda-like palate but it loses it’s complexity in doing so I think.
Rocky River Oompa Loompa Chocolate Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout - Flavored;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap at the brewub. God but somewhat overated stout. Still good flaour for sessionable rated abv. Three eigths of retained mocha head on dark brown body. Lots of chocolate, very chocolately in fact. Some licorice, 31 ibu.Above average mouthfeel.

Rocky River Northern Lights German Helles Alt;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Wow, this is one hoppy alt. The best way to describe the effect of thids beer is to let a very nice IPA mellow for a wee bit. You notice the hops but they don’t take over. I’ll post a better review when time and sobriety allow. Good beer to all those who are concerned though.
Rocky River Northern Lights German Helles Alt;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Goodbar beer club. Nose is slightly chocolate, rye, piney hops, resin, maybe a little orange. Flavor is iced tea, malt. Very hoppy for an alt. Bitter caramel finish.

Very soft, no aftertaste, very little taste overall. Traces of apple and water. Dry empty aftertaste. Definitely among the better happoshus, which doesn’t say much. (0.35l can.)
Kirin Gokunama;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Can. Light yellow colour. Quite waterish aroma of some maltish thing, hoppish and metal, which comes again in the flavour with a very waterish mouthfeel. Then again, this is not real beer according to Japanese law, its a happushu........sheiyt!
Kirin Gokunama;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Harsh ratings are indeed in order--this one tasted, in short, like a super-sweet ""Miller High Life"". But in more detail: aroma was of sweet malt and corn, the flavors were similarly malty and corn-laden. This was an extremely watery brew, easy to consume rapidly, but such a pace is necessary, as this one is certainly not anything to savor. Perhaps the only redeeming quailty is the 5.5% abv, though I seemed to get a headache soon after taking the first sip."
Kirin Gokunama;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);maybe its just because i’ve been drinking taiwan beer daily, but i got this one on special at 7-11 and it tastes mighty fine. those are some harsh ratings preceding me.

Kirin Gokunama;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Can in Kyoto, Japan. Almost clear yellow with a diminishing white head. A light, somewhat tangy, weak flavor but interesting on palate which I would describe as almost sticky.

Kirin Gokunama;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);A decent beer. Had this one in Nagoya, Japan. It’s not that special in flavor, but the text on the can makes it well worth the experience.
Kirin Gokunama;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);I did enjoy trying all these Japanese beers but there just isn't much to them. Just Japanese versions of Bud and Miller.
Bäre-Bräu Bäre-Chrone;Bern, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bäre-Bräu;Cloudy golden coloured. Exotic mango aroma. A very complex and nice pilsener. Sweet notes of honey are well balanced with bitter hop notes. Also rather spicy and grassy.
Bäre-Bräu Bäre-Chrone;Bern, Switzerland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bäre-Bräu;"[Bottled - around 1½ years old] The aroma is very nicely hoppy and grassy - very fresh. The color is an unclear orange and it has a small disappearing head. The flavor is very complex; slighly sour, grassy, hoppy, and sweet honey. An OK beer - but probably better fresh from tap. Thanks a lot to Alex (fiulijn) for bringing this to a sampling session."

A delight. 37 IBU Bottle 2 years old, 2004-01-28, 8-4-8-4-14 Cloudy blond color. Delicate hop; cheesy nose. Dry, bitter taste, quite similar sensation as an Orval (the old hops…).

Harboe Lakseøl;Skælskør, Denmark;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Harboes Bryggeri;A Danish lager without special traits. Light in color and taste. For each sold beer it takes 0,25 DKK to Salmon Foundation, which works to bring wild salmon back in the Danish streams. For that reason I will give an extra point.

Harboe Pinse Bryg;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle from Netto in Århus. Pours a darkish gold with a fast vanishing head and a cereal aroma. Malty body, light hoppiness, faint spice notes, slight bitterness in the aftertaste, a bit too gassy and sweet, otherwise it would be a decent lager.
Harboe Pinse Bryg;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;"Bottle. Clear yellow, with a small white head. Malty sweet, sort of adjuncty, bit cardboardish. Not very enjoyable; Harboe’s regular pilsener is better if you’re looking for a cheap summer beer."
Harboe Pinse Bryg;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;Bottle from Netto. Clear gold, not much of an aroma. Nice taste, though, as a thirst-quencher this is passable. Malty, a little hoppy bite.
Harboe Pinse Bryg;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;330 ml bottle, from NETTO. ABV is 5.7%. Golden colour, large to medium white head. The aroma has first some sweetish malts and grassy and herbal hops, and is better than I feared - then the usual Harboe notes of wet cardboard set in. The flavour is first sugary sweeet, then I get a hint of grassy hops, before the finish with dust and cardboard. Sure, my expectations were low, but I suppose Harboe would be capable of making an even worse show of it. At least the beer was cheap ...
Harboe Pinse Bryg;Skælskør, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harboes Bryggeri;A nice mixture of ascorbic acid and glucose syrup, which makes this otherwise ok lagers to once sugar watery beer.

Hook Norton Golden Jubilee;Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Hook Norton Brewery;Cask Conditioned at The Peyton Arms, Stoke Lyne, Oxon. Brown red beer with thin head. Sharp, acidic cidery beer with a tinny background. Tastes like a rushed attempt to get a beer out for the celebrations, could have done with storing. (from notes)
Hook Norton Golden Jubilee;Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Hook Norton Brewery;Dark brown/ Red in colour, very small head, typical English ale. Very boring beer to celebrate the queens jubilee.
Hook Norton Golden Jubilee;Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Hook Norton Brewery;"What a curious beer. Quickly dissipating head on top of a nice dark ale (I expected, as in other breweries' Jubilee beers that it would be more ""Golden""- quasi lager). Rich aroma, albeit slightly metallic. Flavor packed a punch: first flavor was a protruding smokiness in the early finish that really surprised me. That mellowed, but the bitterness remained, and as I went through the pint, the sweetness (initially a nice contrast) became a bit annoying. Good body, but provided mostly by the carbonation. Once that was gone, this was less satisfying. (Bottle, albeit purchased at the brewery...rated the night of the concluding Jubilee celebrations, with a toast to the Queen)."
Hook Norton Golden Jubilee;Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Hook Norton Brewery;Tried cask conditioned. This beer was brewed especially for the Golden Jubilee, in June 2002. The beer is a dark brown, with strong bitter flavours with a heavy body. It’s surprising that Hook Norton would brew a beer dark beer, similar to an old ale for this summer event. I should imagine this wouldn’t be bad in colder weather, however.

Worthington Ale/Draught/Creamflow;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Molson Coors UK (Molson Coors);From the old notebook with beers of my youth. This was ubiquitous, in pubs also. As with all ‘creamy’ bitters of this era it was basically a beery water with a hint of hop, but this one had a touch of more caramel toffee malt than some. Still crap though.

Shenyang Snowflake Beer;originally Shenyang, now various locations, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;China Resources Snow Breweries (CR Beer - Heineken);A very pale low-alcohol (2.5%) beer. A white, slightly frothy head. Very light with a very slight aroma of hops. The taste is of extremely mild sweetish malts without any bitterness. A very light beer with little flavour.

Shenyang Snowflake Beer;originally Shenyang, now various locations, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;China Resources Snow Breweries (CR Beer - Heineken);This beer is the most variable of the Chinese beers. Sometimes it passes as a half-decent pale lager, while in the worst times it can deliver an instant gag in a bottle, thick, soapy and metallic. Avoid it in cans - in them this brew tastes HEAVILY metallic.
Shenyang Snowflake Beer;originally Shenyang, now various locations, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;China Resources Snow Breweries (CR Beer - Heineken);It's good to see there are other Chinese beers out there besides Tsingtao. Anyway, this was watery, fizzy and crisp. A predictable asian beer, but the label is cool, so I recommend it.
Cheshire Cat Tom Cat Brown Ale;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Draught. Medium amber. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel), moderately hoppy (grapefruit).

Cheshire Cat Arrogant Brit;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;What can I say about this beer, it was so low-key. In a bad way. It smelled and tasted like cereal. Color was an amber-reddish hue and the head was practically non-existent. That could have been due to a bad growler fill as there was lots of space at the top. This was a boring beer and made me mad that I drove across town to get a growler. I swear their beers used to be better or my palate has changed. Either way, I did not enjoy this beer.

Light malty and hops taste. Sweet malt and flowery if you really want to know. Watery mouthfeel. Ends bitter and sour. I could see how a bitter drinker may like this, but to me it was weak, watery and not exciting in any way. Of course, I remember meeting a fellow GABF'er (that sounds obscene!) in an elevator, he asked me my favorite beers and than gasped in horror when I told him. He only really likes traditional English Pale Ales; Mild ones and then ran from me. Heh heh. Scaring people is cool."
Cheshire Cat Arrogant Brit;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Draught. Light amber. Aroma is moderately malty (light bread), lightly hoppy (flowers), with a light note of peach and toffee. Flavor is lightly sweet, lightly bitter, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly bitter, lightly acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. A very pleasant and delicate British bitter. Very quaffable. A little more alcohol than a typical English bitter.
Cheshire Cat Tabby Porter;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Porter;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Dark and clear with red hues. Low, smooth carbonation. Sweet and chewy with a bit of roast. Finish is wet and lingering with notes of chocolate and hints -- hints I say -- of fruit.
Cheshire Cat Tabby Porter;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Porter;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;On tap GABF '02: Hmmm...Chocolate. D'oh! Flat. Wuhoo! Clear dark brown with a nice head. D'ohh! Boring light porter taste. Better than the sum of its parts.
Cheshire Cat Tabby Porter;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Porter;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Draught. Dark brown to black. Aroma is moderately malty (light bread, roasted grain, dark chocolate, mild coffee), with a note of raisin. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Needs more bitterness to balance it, but it's pleasant.
Cheshire Cat Katzenbier;Arvada, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Cheshire Cat Brewpub & Restaurant;Draught. Medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (light bread, cereal), lightly hoppy (flowers), lightly yeasty (dough). Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is moderately acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Marketed as a German wheat, but the lack of clove/banana esters puts this one in the more lackluster American wheat category for me. The acidity is of the rather dull/unfresh variety, not the zesty and refreshing type, so this may have been an old keg.
Golden City IPA;Golden, Colorado, United States;IPA;Golden City Brewery;Dark golden with a clean white foam. Skunky hop aroma. Fantastic hop flavor ,very clean taste, and finishes bitter. Extremely drinkable. Thinker
Golden City IPA;Golden, Colorado, United States;IPA;Golden City Brewery;Had on draft at the tiny brewery. A great little joint in a cool town. Bright golden with aroma of sweet fruit and floral hops.

Rock Bottom Pittsburgh High Level Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;On tap at the Rock Bottom in Pittsburgh. Nice big creamy head like chocolate mousse. Great to look at. Not quiteopaque but almost. Very lovely appearance. Creamy aroma of whipped cream! Makes me attracted to this brew before I even taste it. Some roasted stout or porter attributes in the flavor. Stronger than the other rock bottom brews I’ve had. Has a slight alky bite to it that is absent in their other beers. Good example of a dark beer, dark in taste but not offensive. Friendly yet impressive. Good beer. Much better than Saranac Brown ale and is almost as good as east end fat gary. This is much darker than most other brown ales I’ve tasted. Not too sure if this is in the correct style.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh High Level Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Dark brown, thin white head. Smelt of oats, floral hops and sweet caramel. thin, watery mouthfeel, but a nice smooth, nutty flavor with a mild hops profile. Not too bad, but nothing stellar.

Aroma of malt, nuts, and caramal. Flavor mostly same, malt, hints of caramal and nuts, and a slight hop bite in the aftertaste. Carbonation was good. Brew easy to drink, but the body is watery.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh High Level Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Seemed to me more a stout than a a brown ale. Poured very dark brownish black color with small offwhite head. Roasty malty nutty aroma with a very roasted malt flavor. Smooth finish. Pretty good beer.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh High Level Brown;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;I am generally not overly into brown ales. This draft poured a dark brown color with a small tan head. The aroma was sweet and malty with a hint of chocolate. The flavor is initially sharp and bitter but some coffee, chocolate and roasted malt flavors come on as the beer lingers. Pretty good for a brown.
Black Rock Koelsch;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Black Rock Brewing Company;Excellent Koelsch beer, on the lighter side as far as body goes, nice white head, good hop character, very well balanced, great brew

Black Rock Koelsch;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Black Rock Brewing Company;A very nice beer, brewed for the masses, but I do think it's a little low on the hop flavor and aroma. Terry brews some excellent beers, and this is one of them, but he's capable of much more given a broader palatte.
Black Rock Koelsch;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Black Rock Brewing Company;Sweet vapory, citrus aroma. Very light in color, almost clear with nice head. Smooth, watery palate. Watery taste, some hops - reminded me more of a light beer than a Koelsch.
Black Rock Belgian Saison;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Black Rock Brewing Company;not too bad... I was expecting something spicier... more like a belgian version of a pale ale instead of a saison... perhaps some extra candy sugar and some darker sacchrified malts would help
Black Rock Belgian Saison;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Black Rock Brewing Company;Decent, cloudy, not much flavor, like a watered down belgian................

Aroma I was really picking up the spices, but more like ""holiday"" spices. Maybe it was the cardimom? Hard to get past the spices for me. Was picking up the same thing in the flavor.

Fegley's Brew Works Stumbling Monk;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap at the BBW, this was the best beer out of the sampler, the spices come out in the aroma, with hints of the yeast and fruits. The body was a golden color and the head sat on top for the entire time it took me to drink the other 5 beers and the length of this one. Nutmeg and spices come out stong, and the back of the taste is an excellent blend of malts and hops. Body was very smooth and clean, somewhere in the middle of medium and full. I thought this was excellent.

Moerenburg Meibok;Tilburg, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bierbrouwerij Moerenburg;Tasted the 2002 version. Strange beer for a Meibok which is normally golden coloured and with about 6.5% alcohol.

Arôme malté léger caramel avec une brève note houblonnée et une moutarde qui est pour moi indétectable. Profile reste bien belge avec une moutarde faiblarde, fini grains, sec au palais avec un léger côté houblonné citronné. L’alcool malgré ces 6.5% se développe bien et réchauffe en fin de bouche. Tout comme l’avis du reste de notre table cette version est en manque de moutarde, l’ancienne mettait cette dernière plus à profit.

Golden beer with collossal amounts of floaties, gee this is really lumpy yeast. Stable, dense and oily head - from the mustard seeds?

Baladin Nora 7% Orange gold with a thick light beige head that does not linger for long. The aroma is reminiscent of a Belgian Wit with orange peel, ginger and chewy wheat (Kamut?). Full bodied, raspy carbonation and a big sweet orange marmalade flavor then ginger in the finish. Tangy sweet orange marmalade is a flavor I really wasn’t expecting, fun though I find the carbonation a touch abrasive.

Houston Peter's Well (Bottle);Hillingtonton Park, Glasgow, Scotland;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Houston;"500ml Bottle from Aldi Supermarket, Scotland (£1.99): Subtle earthy malts & sweetness, vanilla & butterscotch with background fruits, burnt sugar & hints of floral too but the sweetness seems to dominate with a little help from the light malts & touches of bitterness. Very light & clear amber, almost watery with a 0.5cm head that’s foamy & frothy before disappearing almost completely. Citrus & lemon initially, sweetness follows with vanilla too. The aftertaste is very strange with some smoky flavours coming through that aren’t all that dissimilar to that of a rauchbier. This one was all over the place really & other than the sweetness at the start it wasn’t a good one at all. Light to light-medium in body, it’s a fairly smooth beer with a slight citrus tang and the smoky/sweet aftertaste was weird to say the least, with a lingering & smoky feel right at the end as well. Another beer I picked up in Aldi that was a little all over the place, this one with a poor beer but had a pleasant smell; the taste definitely let this one down in a big way."

Fast schon glaubt man amerikanischen Aromahopfen zu finden, aber als Spezial-Zutat wurde stattdessen Buchweizen hinzugegeben. Der erwartete Brotgeschmack blieb aber aus. Ein wirklich interessantes, fruchtiges Bier."

Aroma is chocolate, vinegar and a little of the savoury cheese notes that I usually dislike of the style. Flavour is savoury caramel with almost some Cola fruitiness and a clean finish. Essentially ordered in panic at a restaurant, and it’s not a style I’m fond of, but much better than it could have been.

Schloss Eggenberg Dunkel;Vorchdorf, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg;Seems that this isn’t retired anymore. Bought a bottle a few days ago in a supermarket in Vorchdorf, near the brewery. Dark red to brown, clear body, with a big, frothy, beige head, that isn’t very stable. Aroma of roasted malt, caramel, nuts, red and dark berries and also some metallic notes. Taste with about the same aromas, but sweeter, with the fruity and caramel notes more present and with metallic notes again. Mouthfeel is medium, slick, with a low carbonation and it finishes sweet and slightly roasty-bitter. Firstly, the metallic notes aren’t really pleasant, but at least they disappear more and more the more this beer warms up. Otherwise this is an average Dunkel, that isn’t bad, but, as many other beers of this style, too sweet for my liking. Overall decent, but not as good as I expected.
Schloss Eggenberg Dunkel;Vorchdorf, Austria;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauerei Schloss Eggenberg;Drunk from bottle in Schloetgen, Austria. Very dark and quite sweet beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Definitely the best dunkel I had while in Europe and one that I wouldn’t mind drinking again.

Mussel Inn Red Herring;Onekaka, New Zealand;Smoked - Other;The Mussel Inn;Ah yes, but is it better than a slap in the face with a wet fish? On the brownish side of amber with a persistent collar of off-white head. I didn’t get a great deal of smoke on the nose but I did get redwood, a faint whisp of aromatic woodsmoke, biscuity amber malt and lashings of dehydrated apricots and guavas. The more it sat, the more smoke started to make itself known - cunning blighter. The smoke became more prevalent in the mouth among the initially prickly carbonation and smooth oily texture. It’s like sticking your head in the chimney of a fireplace once you’ve been burning copper beech or native timbers (not that I countenance burning New Zealand native timber when there’s perfectly good furniture to be made and obviously once the fire has died out). This beer wasn’t an overt smoky monster but was subtle, elegant and heartwarming. This is a beer to enjoy beside a fire while the elements rage outside and your labrador lies with his chin on your sock-clad feet. I’d even venture there may be a pipe involved somehow. By the way, it is better than a slap in the face with a wet fish.

Lighthouse Brewery Classic Stout;Nelson, New Zealand;Stout;Lighthouse Brewery (NZ);This was a pint enjoyed in the excellent company of Geoff, Pip, Jeremy, Hazel and Mike at the Old Bank Tavern in Redwood among a few other pints and a few other luminaries. In such a situation it was hard not to enjoy this beer. It appeared as dark as proverbial with a collar of temporary cocoa coloured head. I think it would probably gain a great deal from handpull, but gas-flow was was the way it came. Once it had sat for a while to come up to temperature, the aroma was of ground cocoa beans, some plummy dark fruits and freshly ground coffee. These aromas are all winners in my book and were prominent in the flavour profile along with some darker grains. This contributed to a lengthy finish that is still undergoing changes on my tongue around forty five minutes after the last of my glass was drained. Still dusty cocoa and dehydrated coffee: this is a pint worth paying attention to and stood up well after the hoppy pale ales that had preceded it. Even if I hadn’t been in such good company, I think this beer would have kept me appropriately occupied.

Port Townsend Bitter End India Pale Ale;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;IPA;Port Townsend Brewing Company;"22 oz. bottle from Hayduke. We shared it via facebook chat. We had difficulty identifying it. Our bottles don’t say ""Bitter End"" but neither does the bottle in the photo here. This bottle had a little yeast in the bottom so I rolled it some. Due to the yeast it was hazy and golden orange with a nice lightly orange hued foam that never quite left. The nose was light with pine and floral hops and caramel. Nice but bigger would have been better. I get a powdery feel which is rare for an IPA. There are citrus, pine, and floral hop notes. That caramel, too. This is generally understated and quite pleasant. The hops didn’t taste real fresh so this bottle might have a bit of age on it. I like it"

Port Townsend Boatyard Bitter;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - English;Port Townsend Brewing Company;English pales are becoming some of my favorites, and this one is archetypical of the style.

Port Townsend Brown Porter;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Porter;Port Townsend Brewing Company;April 16th, 2010 - Port Townsend is another one of those small breweries that works with a skilled distributor. Amongst the big boys, my QFC always had room for the little guys, which gave me the opportunity to enjoy a surprisingly well brewed porter. Their version doesn’t prop up any foam, and has all the trappings of your typical dark brown beer, but the aroma is sweet, creamy and has that agricultural smell of rich, dark soil, still clinging to vegetables at the farmer’s market. Delving into the flavor reveals even more - sweet yet savory, with dried raisins and plums, a brief aftertaste, and a little but of a dusty, dry grainy finish. Solid, well weighted on the tongue and balanced, this is an excellent porter, and one where I really have to...go against the grain...of the Ratebeer community.
Port Townsend Brown Porter;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Porter;Port Townsend Brewing Company;This was a dark red pour with a robust tan head and a lot of lacing. Nose of roast malts with coffee aromas. Medium body. Flavor was on the mild side but was very tasty and the finish shows some nuts. Quite drinkable brew.
Port Townsend Brown Porter;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Porter;Port Townsend Brewing Company;From Hayduke. We shared it via facebook chat. 22 oz. bottle. This poured dark with plenty of red and a nice thick tan head that never quite left. A bit of lacing. The nose was soft coffee. This was poured right out of the refrigerator and was too cold. Warmer temperatures did nice things to it. In the end this was much like a Pale Ale but with some nuts and coffee. The commercial description uses the word intense but that is not the case. There are subtle notes, though. Vanilla among them. If this is a porter it is a very light one. It is quite different and enjoyable.
Port Townsend Brown Porter;Port Townsend, Washington, United States;Porter;Port Townsend Brewing Company;Black with woody brown lacing. Aroma of chocolate, smoke, watery coffee, slight butter, slight lime, peanut brittle. Taste is roasty and a bit sour- lemonlime, smoky.

Hetzel Frauendorfer Premium Landbier;Bad Staffelstein-Frauendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Hetzel;Bottle, best by May 7, 2016: Hazed amber. Quick eggshell head. Dirty nose of peanuts, paint, hay, fennel seed, wax and floral hops. Pointy carbonation and flimsy in body. Caramelly and sweet with papery malt and chalky yeast bitterness. Quite unclean, as its considerably dough and fruity. DMS also finds its way into the mix alongside a gummy candy slickness and stewed peach character which exacerbates the excessive level of sugars. Despite the poor attenuation, the center is somehow stark and hollow. Generic papery malt finish shows wet hay, chalk, and faint nuttiness. A very generic and dirty lager. Nein danke!

Seems to be the same beer: now labeled as Scotch Ale / 8%, but the description is the same. Reddish to light brown color with a creamy tan head. Smokey, almost burnt taste. Some sweetness as well. Kind of odd and didn't quite work for me.
Sprecher Pipers Scotch Ale;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Sprecher Brewing Company;Not as hearty and bready as some of the true Scotch Ales I had. On the thinner side as far as caramel malt and flavor...though I tasted a decent amount of liquid smoke. Seemed only about 5-6%, so was surprised it was over 8% ABV. A nice enjoyable beer...which I used as a dinner pairing.
Sprecher Pipers Scotch Ale;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Sprecher Brewing Company;One of Sprechers better beers. good body and no lingering aftertaste, Smokey and rich. But nothing impressive.
Sprecher Pipers Scotch Ale;Glendale, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Sprecher Brewing Company;Fruity esters of smokiness. Apple like flavors with lots of smokiness. Nose carrries all these parts as well. Lots of body. Overall this doesn't work together. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Smuttynose Big A IPA;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Smuttynose Brewing Company;Bottle pour, they say you remember your first and this heavy IPA is no exception. Really intense pine tar and sap notes, thick, almost chewy. A bat to the mouth bitter.

Pour it hazy orange color with big white head. Aroma candy, old orange rotten feel. Taste odd, orange, old batch, tingling in my throat, slick feel, light body, average carbonation, abrupt finish, not so fresh unfotunately.
Smuttynose Big A IPA;Hampton, New Hampshire, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Smuttynose Brewing Company;From Sept 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with NutBrown. Thanks Alan! Served at cellar temp: It pours a clear gold with a 2 finger head of billowy foam. The smell is a big dose of grapefruit and piney hops with some caramel malt lingering in the background. Nice nose indeed. The taste has the big notes of grapefruit and pine up front but the caramel malt I noted in the nose has an even more solid presence in the taste. Is it perfectly balanced? No, but it certainly isn't one dimensional and that's a plus when it comes to how drinkable this DIPA is for me and the alcohol *does* give me some warming for sure but it isn't all encompassing and doesn't stop me from enjoying this drop. I can also taste some other fruit, maybe mango and tangerine? Nice. Mouthfeel is on the thick side..very substantial and I'm liking that muchly. The carbonation is on the low side of medium and it finishes pleasingly bitter. Btw, head retention is great and there's plenty of sticky lacing. Also, with the second pour, the brew became hazy. Bottom line: A very good DIPA here that doesn't go overboard with the hops thanks to a good malt backbone. I enjoyed my session with this bottle and I think you will too.

Rubia cristalina con abundante espuma jabonosa con retención aceptable. Cuerpo ligero, aguada y con mucho gas. Aroma escaso a cereal y sabor en la línea, aunque con matices de mantequilla, maíz y un toque metálico algo artificial. Postgusto ligeramente amargo y seco. No está mal como curiosidad.

Morrells Grumpy Cow;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Marston's;Cask Conditioned at The North Arms, Wroxton, Oxon. Pale brown with no head. Flat as a pancake, no condition whatsoever and this was a fresh barrel. Thin watery insipid beer, an absolute stinker.
Morrells Grumpy Cow;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Marston's;Light color and consistency. Large bubbles forming on side of glass made it look like 7-Up. Not a bad bitter flavor, but a bit weak. Similarly, rather watery but not bad by comparison to many beers in this style. Some sweetness, for one moment it reminded me of taffy. (on tap, Bookbinders Arms, Jericho, Oxford)
Hampshire Ironside;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;Tasted this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in June 2007. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear reddish amber in colour with a thick white head. Slight malt note in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a digestive biscuit note with boiled redcurrant jam in the mouth. Strong metallic tang of bitter hop resins impart a dry note to the aftertaste. Finish is slightly malty with tart redcurrant fruit present in the mouth. An ok session bitter.
Hampshire Ironside;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;April 2008 Amber beer. Light palate. Hoppy and a little bit fruity. Dry finish.

Hampshire Ironside;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;[on cask at Nag’s Head, Reading] Deep amber/orange with a slight but lasting white head. Surprisingly rich - flavours are malt, leaves, some earthiness, a bit of sweet rhubarb crumble and maybe a hint of honey leaving a rather sweet, almost sticky palatte - there’s not a lot of bitterness here. The stickiness made it taste like a stronger beer than its ABV suggested - in fact, reminded me a little of Fullers ESB. Not bad at all for a bitter.
Hampshire Ironside;Romsey, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hampshire Brewery;"Bottle 500ml from Tesco’s, New Milton. Bottle conditioned. Pours a slightly hazy amber colour with a small white head. Not a heavy aroma, but what there was was a kind of fruity/hoppy. Medium bodied; quite bitter in taste, with some fruits coming through as well. The bitterness lingers on for a while – can’t say I particularly noticed the dryness."

Gustav Werner Alt Amber Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. More orange beer, slight aroma of rotten fruit.
Gustav Werner Alt Amber Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. I really hope that a typical macro drinker does not use this package as their first foray into trying new beers, because these brews will surely send them screaming back to the comforts of BudMillerCoors. Pours a murky orange (again) color with a thin off-white head. Vague aroma of sour apples. Flavor is bitingly sour with a dry, slightly hoppy finish. I am hoping these beers are at least doing some good in cleaning our my drainpipes."
Gustav Werner Alt Amber Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cold Spring Brewery;I must agree with my fellow beer raters. This does taste like shit. Compared to all the European beers i have tried this is not even close to an old european beer.
Gustav Werner Alt Amber Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cold Spring Brewery;"Alright, So your actually telling me that this stuff goes by the name of gusatv. So already I've checked my sack at the door, and now I'M supposed to tell all the people round the world how i really enjoyed the texture of this paste like brew, and how I really thought that it had a robust, old european flavor, well fuck no, this was some shit, Brock tried to plead his case that this one was , actually no he didn;t, we were in complet compliance that this was shit. period.."
Gustav Werner Alt Amber Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cold Spring Brewery;Absolute shee-ot!!! I can not believe that this swill is actually considered beer! This beer puts the suc in sucks balls! The icemane and myself JUST suffered through this beer and were bitter, very bitter. It had no taste and was strangely reminiscent of Scholz beer, hmmmm...almost as if scholz was made by the same brewer. Anyway before bying this beer just lick a random guy's sweaty nut sack and it will taste better!
Wurch & Warnke Bohemian Style Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Cold Spring Brewery;From old tasting notes. Just read the previous reviews. They speak the truth. A horribly tasteless mess.

I have to sample all 12, as my wife got this for me and with her not liking ratebeer as it is, I want her to think she did good. The thought counts.
Wurch & Warnke Bohemian Style Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Cold Spring Brewery;"A novel idea. ""12 greatest beers of the world"". But, no, let's make a batch of amber, a batch of pale, a batch of brown and bottle it and put different labels on it. OK, not quite true, but The differences between these beers, even though said to be different styles was scary. Yellow color with a white fizzy head. Acidic and bland."
Wurch & Warnke Bohemian Style Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Cold Spring Brewery;"The straw that broke the camels back! I could not finish the 18 beers from the two Gluek Sams Club gift packs. This was pure chemical water collected at the runoff spout of a chemical and biological weapons storage plant. It actually burned going down, erupting an old volcano of acid reflux. I, honestly, have to take several days off from drinking because of this. It's nearly midnight on a Sunday night and I'm drinking ""Wurch & Warnke"" sitting 6 feet away from a freshly tapped keg of 2003 Oberon. They have meetings for this type of behavior."
Wurch & Warnke Bohemian Style Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. Again - just plain bad. I don''t particularly like pilsners anyway - but this might be teh worst one ever.
Wurch & Warnke Bohemian Style Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. I am not usually a fan of this style anyway, so having a pale imitation like this didn''t help much. Pours an orangish-yellow color (I have noticed all the Old European brews have been some type of orange so far) with a thin off-white head. Mild hops aroma. Flavor is both watered-down and sour, with a somewhat dry finish. Avoid."
Wurch & Warnke Bohemian Style Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Cold Spring Brewery;This beer isn't the worst I have had. In fact I think it is much better than other dirt cheap competitors such as pabst or busch, or something of the like. I don't necessarily reccomend this beer, but I would prefer it to other generic beers for the monetarily challenged.
Wurch & Warnke Bohemian Style Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Cold Spring Brewery;Well, for starters yall could change the name from wurch and warnke to fuck and fucking suck. This was a ruthless voyage, seroiusly. Here's the worst part, It was 16 onces , not twelve. Well hot damn, someone had to finish this shit so it would actually show up as a rating, so i split a 16 with brock, and no that is not a sexual reference.
Wurch & Warnke Bohemian Style Pilsner;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Cold Spring Brewery;Well to almost any veteran beer drinker a pilsner is shit. This beer stands out in its shittiness but hey. Its overpriced, terrible, and if you see OLD EUROPEAN BREWING you know its the same as Scholz. And it does lick asss!!!

New Holland Dragon's Milk;Holland, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;New Holland Brewing Company;Bottle. From November, 2018. Black. Brown head, two fingers, decent retention. Difficult to see the carbonation through the darkness. Almost creamy texture with delicate fizz. Aroma is strange: vanilla -but not bourbon-, barrel -strange, maybe old barrel but does not have a lot of character, altough it's tasty-, background of caramel. Taste is the same. Soft sweetness. Soft bitterness at the end. Alcohol is well integrated. Feels like a 8% Stout. But also feels like a Strong Ale. Anyway, it's good.
New Holland Dragon's Milk;Holland, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;New Holland Brewing Company;By far this is my favorite beer. Goes great with wasabi or anything spicey.
New Holland Dragon's Milk;Holland, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;New Holland Brewing Company;One of the most overrated drinks I've ever been recommended. It's extremely bitter and sour.
New Holland Dragon's Milk;Holland, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;New Holland Brewing Company;New to craft beer and saw this was a must get in the stout category.

Dunham Castle Limited London Nutty Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. This is not nutty! Who is making these? This is terrible! I mean you can''t just call your beer a nutty brown ale if it tastes like freaking bud light.
Dunham Castle Limited London Nutty Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. This sampler has made my average sink like a stone over the weekend, and I am realizing it has been awhile since I have had so many bad beers in a row. It''s a nice change from the pursuit of good beer all the time to just sit back some weekend and drink an assload of subpar beer. Anyway this brew scores points for being the first Old European that wasn''t orange. Other ""red"" and ""brown"" beers in this line have been thoroughly orange. It''s still not a good beer but it is progress. Pours and amber color with minimal head. Weak malt aroma. Back to the sour flavor, this one particularly tannic. Another drain pour."
Dunham Castle Limited London Nutty Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;So once again, the mo, fo's from the scholz brewery make their presence.

Brock is in total agreance, i mean, fuckin A, Dunham Castle,... Is this a fucking mini golf course or what?
Dunham Castle Limited London Nutty Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Fuckin ridiculously terrible. I mean scholz can not let up in its pursuit of shitty beer. The iceman and i jUST drank this bee-otch and it is totally uninspired and absolutely lacking in taste and style. In fact the only thing this beer has going for it is it is brewed by frederick scholz and can be recognized immediately as the equivalent of licking a sweaty asshole after a cardio workout and without a shower. God damn this fuckin SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

St. Johnsbury Porter;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Cold Spring Brewery;Notes from ’98. Straight from the bottle. Good porter for the price. Slight roasted flavor. This was purchased in a 16oz. bottle I believe. It was not from the Beers of the world thing. I picked this up at Vons on Aero Dr.

St. Johnsbury Porter;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. This is not a porter - it is orange like just about every other beer in this pack and it tastes disgusting.
St. Johnsbury Porter;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. This beer is absolutely heinous. It was even lighter in color than the ""Stout"" I had before it. It looked like I was pouring a glass of Killian''s. Now that my ""12 Greatest Brews"" experience is over, what have I learned? I have learned that it is possible to make 12 different ""styles"" of beers look and taste startlingly similar. I have learned that I can pour out 180 out of 192 ounces of beer and not feel guilty. I always try to find the good in any non0-macro beer, but in this case Old Eurpoean needs to take one for the team and just go out of business already."
St. Johnsbury Porter;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Cold Spring Brewery;Since when does a porter look like a miller lite? This has no taste and barely an aroma. Crap. Cheap. I'd consider budweiser closer to a porter than this.
St. Johnsbury Porter;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Cold Spring Brewery;So they call this one st johnsbury, So all i can say after having this one is that st john's bury his face in my ass, cause this was fucking horrible. Seriosly, does anyone actually think that anything from the old eouropean brewery is actually any good. Dear lord, does history not repeat it self, is dust not dust, is shit not shit, is old european not the worst shit ever imaginable, i mean serousiouly, if they all told me back in the day to make a product that resembled shit and creeped the hell out of everyone I would have just said, Fuck, here's the recipe for st johnsbury. Brock and Funk, I know that yall have a taste for this flavor, but every once and a while we all take one for the team, we all make a SACracife, we all actually enjoy what were doin.
St. Johnsbury Porter;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Cold Spring Brewery;This is supposed to be a porter? I agree the old european brewery somehow found a way to make absolute shit shittier. But hey the iceman and I took one for the team and drank this swill. It tasted like a draft macro that someone poured dirty dish water in. If you drink this prepare yourself for one nasty beer shit come morning.
21st Amendment Hop Caen;San Leandro, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;21st Amendment Brewery;Big hop nose with subtle fruit tones(cherries?) and a red brown color. A sweetish roasted maltiness up front bursts into a huge hop bitterness. Full-bodied and smooth.
21st Amendment Hop Caen;San Leandro, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;21st Amendment Brewery;Big hoppy aroma, vine, herbal, grassy. Deep malts lightly roasty with caramel and hints of honey. Delicious!
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;From old tasting notes. Brewed by Colonial Brewing Company in Evansville, Indiana. Bright yellow gold color. Creamy white head. Mild sweet malt aroma. Soft, dryish malt flavor is lacking any wheat malt character. Light flavor and body leave you wanting something more.
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;WARNING, Not one of the 12 GREATEST BREW! I have to sample all 12, as my wife got this for me and with her not liking ratebeer as it is, I want her to think she did good. The thought counts. Worse
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;I think i made a mistake buying so many brews from these guys.Nice golden color small white head that faded quickly leaving little behind.The aroma was not great,Mildly wheaty with a slight fruit presence maybe some hops.The taste was nasty with the flavor emulating the aroma for the most part with a nasty sort of off taste coming through.Just not a good brew at all.I guess if you need a rating here it is but if your shooting for taste forget it,it’s just not there at all.Shame on ya Glueks for going where you shouldn’t.
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"A novel idea. ""12 greatest beers of the world"". But, no, let's make a batch of amber, a batch of pale, a batch of brown and bottle it and put different labels on it. OK, not quite true, but The differences between these beers, even though said to be different styles was scary. Yellow color with a white fizzy head. Acidic and bland."
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Dogbrick's rating is great. This should be banned from beer section at Sams Club. It would go better with the 60lb bags of dog food because that is what it smells like. You have to love the description about wheat beer need not be cloudy. I just drank about 6 ounces of this shit and I'm startring to get a little bit of heartburn and really annoyed.
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. Terrible macro tasting piss fizz. Really really bad.
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. You just know you are getting into trouble with a claim like that. Sure enough, not only was this not the best Wheat beer in the world, I doubt it was even the best Wheat beer at Wal-Mart. Pours an ugly fizzy yellow with a thin white head. A little hops in the aroma. Flavor was mostly sour with just enough hops to keep me from dumping the whole thing. As it stands I only dumped half."
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;I had this with the iceman and it was total shit. Totally macro-like swill that sucks from start to finish.
Bison Brand Original Wheat;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Wheat Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;So first off we have to address the fact that the word bison is used. In the world of the dead, the word bison is God. So is this gods beer, well , thats up for the bison to decide. So as i wait for his decision, i realize that a bison can not speak and therefore i will never know if i am set free, so lets all take this leftover donation money, buy some forties , get fucked up and pretend that this shit all makes some sort of sense, or not and just buy some 7 11 chilli dogs.
Draught House Weizenheimer;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Draught House Pub & Brewery;(Draught) Pours a cloudy maize body with a small white head. Aroma of orange peel, clove, vanilla, and banana. Flavor of clove, grapefruit, banana bread, and grass with a dry, bitter finish.
Draught House Weizenheimer;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Clouded orange color. Lemon slice that was dropped into this overpowers the aroma. Expected flavors of lemon with some edginess of wheat grain. Would have liked to try it without the fruit first.
Draught House Weizenheimer;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Draught House Pub & Brewery;6-1-08 tap Super cloudy thick glowing orange with a nice little white head. It has a hefeweizen funk to it in the nose but it is muted and a bit more balanced than some. Flavor is funky and wheaty and a hint of bananas are in there too. Nice thick mouthfeel with a medium carbonation. Overall, a nice beer.
Draught House Weizenheimer;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Pours yellowish orange and hazy with a small head. Smell is lighty spiced, yeasty and wheaty. Taste is bubble gummy, wheat and nice, with mild spicing. Actual, strong and noticeable hop presence really makes this unique. Semi rich body, tasty and refreshing. Great summer brew.
Draught House Weizenheimer;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Pours cloudy bright/straw yellow, small head. Smels like leather. Is this a recurring theme with Draught House? Flavor is of light wheat, and is naturally sweet. It tastes really good. Aftertaste is thick wheat and leathery. Good though.
Draught House Weizenheimer;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Hazy dark amber, creamy white head. Light nose of lemon, clove, and hints of bubblegum. Flavor was soft and fruity with more spiced bubblegum tones that round into a light bitterness. Light to medium bodied, light carbonation, fruity spiced finish. It was aiiight, but nothing special...

Draught House Weizenheimer;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Well, from what others have said I would say the body issue has been addressed as I felt it not to be watery in the least and also had quite a lot of flavor. The unfortunate aspect for me was that there seemed to be a slight tannic twinge in the finish that was stron enough to throw it off from being much more enjoyable. Still, not bad.
Draught House Weizenheimer;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Draught House Pub & Brewery;This is back on tap...and who cares. Not all that great...ion fact watery,weak and only slightly wheaty. Like bad micro hefe’s G-rat
Bölkstoff;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Flensburger Brauerei;0,33 l swing top bottle. Clear golden, big off white head. Grainy smell little bit citrus. Taste is more flat grainy, dry bitterness. Cardboardy in the aftertaste. Can not convince.
Bölkstoff;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Flensburger Brauerei;Clear golden with a thick white head. Citrus aroma. Taste has elements of fruit, some flower, a gentleman bitterness. Overall a standard Pils but with a little twist.
Bölkstoff;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Flensburger Brauerei;Lübeck 16/4 2019. 33 cl bottle with a swing cap like other beers from Flensburger Brewery. Figure from Werner Comics “fumping” a bottle on the label. Looks quite irritating (but my daughter thought the beer looked “cute” - not a guarantee for anything). Pours clear pale yellow with a big white head. Settles as frothy layer of foam clinging to the sides of the glass. Substantial Lacing. Aroma is sweet malts in abundance. Sweet, Bready, grainy malts. Light grassy notes with an acerbic touch. Light carbonation. Thin, watery texture with a Soft, foamy touch. Flavor is medium sweet followed by a stronger sour bitterness. Aftertaste bitter with a rough touch. Lingers for a bit. Not the most sophisticated of beers bi’ut not without it’s own rough charm.
Bölkstoff;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Flensburger Brauerei;Can. Pours clear yellow. Aroma is grains, müesli, lactic. Body is light, bitter, and not much else besides carbonation. Some malt body, with off flavours. Ugh.
Bölkstoff;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Flensburger Brauerei;A quite nice and easy drinkable pilsner. Nothing special, but nothing wrong either. Refreshing with some pork. Malty and herbal flavor. [Can from Sune – Holevannet 2018]
Bölkstoff;Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Flensburger Brauerei;Sampled from 0.33 l bottle from local 'toom', best before August 2019. Clear, golden with a medium large, frothy, almost stable, white head. Sweetish, slightly grassy-spicy aroma of grains and some straw. Just slightly sweet, moderately bitter, gently grassy-spicy taste of grains and straw, followed by a short, quite bitter, grassy-spicy and slightly metallic finish. Thin to medium body, slightly effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Not very good, as expected.

Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Drank at Brewery 2001. Always, always a bit too hot. High alcohol, and probably due to their space constraints a bit young.
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;They aimed for the middle and hit with amazing accuracy. Everything about this beer screams half-assed, from the weak aroma to the faint amber tint to the slippery palate, and ending up with the so-so flavor. This is a baseline for the style. It has no pizazz whatsoever.
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;2002 Vintage- amazingly smooth and well aged. All of the edges are removed- completely smoothed out. Almost too drinkable- all malt up front and the alochol is scarily removed. A teaser for sure.
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap at Bitter End. Batch 2002. Murky medium copper with some head and lacing. Smooth as silk. The hop bitterness has mellowed very nicel. Very balanced malt profile. Lots of body. Very warming as well. I’m glad they brought this out to try!
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;2003 Batch Aroma: dull, grain alcohol, some fruit and dirty socks Appearance: dark, woody brown, white head, some lacing Flavor: lots of dark wood, some peat/moss, earthiness, sweet berry flavor, cherry cough syrup Palate: smooth and bubbly, crisp, slightly dry bite, woody aftertaste
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;2003 vintage - sampled in Feb 2005. Plum colored with a very small head. Sharp aroma of plastic, dull grain alcohol and bleach? Metallic and full of chemical flavors... but there is a strong showing of decent plum and dark, sour cherries... abrasive and foul tasting at times with an acetone quality. Something happened to this one since 2003, and that something wasn’t good.
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had on tap at the B-Sides - Dark orange to amber colored pour with a generous amount of mocha colored foam - leads to good thick lacing. The aroma has a bit of a brandy essences to it with some molasses accents. Has some caramel, dates and raisins in the flavor with a bit of underlying smokiness. Not as much hops as I would expect in a Barley Wine though. Nice thick mouthfeel, overall, very decent.
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;2003 version. Medium brown color with excellent head of very small bubbles. The aroma is malty with some hops coming through. The flavor is incredible with oak, must, vanilla, fruit, and candy sweetness. Wow! Thanks for saving a keg guys.
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;2003: Poured hazy amber...smell is dark fruit and alcohol...taste is simple and delicate with light taste of dark fruits...finish is crisp and sweet with some alcohol...I never tried it before but I guess 2 years did it well...
Bitter End Bullethead Barleywine;Austin, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Agree that this tastes a bit under the alcohol strength for a BW, but for a bar, maybe that''s not such a bad idea. Not sure what the actual strength is, but it has all the other fine character needed. Malt and hops and a FINE mouth feel and nice aroma even for a stuffy head.
Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Had it on tap a few days after the fire, very sad indeed. Nice rich amber color. Had a refreshing citrusy smooth taste. Carbonation was on the low side, but I dont think that detracted from anything. A pleasant beer, especially after walking around in 100 degree Austin heat.
Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;On draught. Amber color with nice head & lacing. The aroma has a nice balanced hop and malt profile going. The flavor is very balanced as well. This batch might have more malt than I remember in the past but it is quite nice with the hops balancing nicely. Not your average pale ale. Quite drinkable. Great beer.
Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Tap. Smooth malty body with a thick velvet like mouthfeel. Very, very clean with a dry apple like finish. Slight cherry aftertaste. Excellent and enjoyable.

Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pour is golden amber with a thin off white head...smell is grassy and perfumey with lots of floral hops and malt accenting the whole aroma...taste is sweet at first and lots of pepper and hops going on toward the finish...nice...
Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This was a very good brew. At first I didn’t think there wa sa whole lot going on with this one. However as I sunk in I realized all the smoke in the bar was clogging out my olfactory senses. Great brew. Rich thick coper color. Head dissipates. Smells like fresh ground black pepper and fresh vegetables. I know kind of strange but excellent smelling. BRew tastes like ground pepper and lemon. Aftertaste is nice and dry like a good californie common. Excellent brew. grat
Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Deep copper color and a lightly sweet aroma. Candy-like, floral lager yeast profile. Body has a nice subtle caramel sweetness. A very nice steam beer.
Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"What style WON'T these guys at Bitter End tackle. A ""steam"" beer is truly uncommon, especially down in Austin, where everyone drinks a so-called ""bock"" called Shiner. This Mopac steam beer is true to style and is a reasonable facsimile of the famous Bay Area Anchor Steam. Hoppy and enjoyable."
Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"MoPac is short for Missouri-Pacific, and it represents a highway in Austin that has a railroad running along it. MoPac looks cool because of the ""Green Belt"", a nice wooded area with all kinds of parks and trails and stuff. Unfortunately Mopac Steam Engine beer didn't look as good. It has almost no head and I deducted another point because of the fact that despite it being served in an awesome looking Bitter End glass, it still looked kind of bad. I'm not sure what it was supposed to be, but it smelled and tasted just like a pale ale."
Bitter End Mopac Steam Engine;Austin, Texas, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;This beer reminded me of an average pale ale. Very little head, amber color. Somewhat hoppy with a decent malt balance. Very effervescent.
Bitter End ForceAle IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Is it ""force-ale"" or is it ""for-cale""? Hoppy, nice smell but off-balance flavor. Pale and bitter, blah."
Bitter End ForceAle IPA;Austin, Texas, United States;IPA;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pale orange color, little head. Reminded me a lot of a redhook IPA....tons of floral hops with little malt to back it up. Very bitter and a not very refreshing finish.
Jever Dark;Jever, Lower Saxony, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Friesisches Brauhaus zu Jever (Radeberger Gruppe);En øl der desværre ikke når samme højder som Jever pilsneren. Den mangler lidt skarphed som pilsneren og lidt fylde som mørk øl.

San Andreas Earthquake Porter;Hollister, California, United States;Porter;San Andreas Brewing;First of all, the color is way too light. I've had many brown ales this color...transparent medium brown. The aroma was of burnt peanuts, and slight hops bitterness. The flavor was exactly like a Butterfinger's candy bar (sweet peanut butter and chocolate)...it was actually quite enjoyable. The feel was watery and too thin.
San Andreas Earthquake Porter;Hollister, California, United States;Porter;San Andreas Brewing;Yes its better on tap. Great burnt nose nad taste, but way too thin.........
San Andreas Earthquake Porter;Hollister, California, United States;Porter;San Andreas Brewing;I don't know if my bottle was old, but this tasted like a watered down guiness. Stay away from this beer, unless the brewery is next to your house.
Draught House Bedhells Best Brown;Austin, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Nice looking, fairly unassming, but I don’t assume or presume to like brown ales much and the lean to being too sweet did nothing to win me over.

Fegley's Brew Works Kriekbier;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;OK, I really wanted to taste their cask conditioned peanut butter stout, but this was the funkiest that they had at the beer tasting. And funky it was, too. Great amber apricot color, not the brown or brownish red I expected from a kriek. Not as funky stinky as a lambic, but nicely sour, with a dry fruit offset, slighlt barnyard smell, good lambic finish. Lewis Thomas their brewer is very proud of the beer, and rightly so. But no one is allowed to like the smell of a lambic!

Sweet burnt caramel, cappuccino aroma. Bittersweet chocolate malt flavor. There is a hint of licorice and smokiness that lends to its complexity.creamy mouthfeel. A very good American stout.
Blue Ridge (MD) Steeple Stout;Easton, Maryland, United States;Stout;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);17-Apr-14 (12-oz bottle, 2005 release: Obtained in trade with hopscotch, thanks Eric!) Drank a lot of Steeple Stout in the 90s when I lived in DC, one of my favorites back then. It’s still pretty solid. The beer pours a black body with a short, dark-tan head, fading to a ring. The roasty, chocolaty aromas are very pleasant and enticing, smelling moderately sweet. It’s really tasty on the palate, with prominent flavors of dark chocolate bar and cocoa, with lesser notes of coffee, tobacco, grilled meat, and cola. Light-medium sweetness is nicely balanced by mild, roasty, cacao-like bitterness. The beer is full bodied, medium in carbonation, and soft, smooth, and creamy in mouthfeel. Overall, this is such a perfect stout for me. It’s a little sweet, a little bitter, and a lot delicious. And talk about beautiful cellaring capability, wow!
Blue Ridge (MD) Steeple Stout;Easton, Maryland, United States;Stout;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Pours dark brown with a light brown head. Smells of roasted malt, spice, some sweet chocolate hints. Tastes dry and earthy with a roasty finish.

Aroma of grapes, chocolate and light coffee. Medium to Full-bodied; Deep chocolate, coffee and roasted malt flavours throughout the taste. Aftertaste shorly follows with a pleasant sweetness, a good chocolate kick and somewhat of a bitter coffee taste. Overall, a damn good stout - no horrible tastes at all, just good ones! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Norm’s in Vienna, Virginia on 04-September-2005 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia."
Blue Ridge (MD) Steeple Stout;Easton, Maryland, United States;Stout;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Nice aroma, good color, ok taste. Full body with malt and a hint of caramel flavor. A bit on the tart side of things when it comes to taste.

Blue Ridge (MD) Steeple Stout;Easton, Maryland, United States;Stout;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Pours a medium black with a small head of tan bubbles. Smells or earthy malts, chocolate and coffee. Nothing out of the ordinary, just a very straight forward, drinking stout. Flavors are also of chocolate, balanced nicely with roasted malts and hops. Alcohol is just right, solid.
Blue Ridge (MD) Steeple Stout;Easton, Maryland, United States;Stout;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Good stout. Not too much alcohol, reminds me of an Australian stout like Sheaf, but with less molasses flavor. A very light body for such a nutty, chocolatey beer.
Jacob Rosenberger & Son Germanic Style Dark;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;From old tasting notes. Deep reddish brown. Tan head. Toasted malt nose . Malt flavor is thin and watery. Little hops to speak of. Nothing like the brews of Munich.
Jacob Rosenberger & Son Germanic Style Dark;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;WARNING, Not one of the 12 GREATEST BREW! I have to sample all 12, as my wife got this for me and with her not liking ratebeer as it is, I want her to think she did good. The thought counts.
Jacob Rosenberger & Son Germanic Style Dark;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;"A novel idea. ""12 greatest beers of the world"". But, no, let's make a batch of amber, a batch of pale, a batch of brown and bottle it and put different labels on it. OK, not quite true, but The differences between these beers, even though said to be different styles was scary. Light amber color with an off white fizzy head. Acidic and bland."
Jacob Rosenberger & Son Germanic Style Dark;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;As with the rest of the beers from this sampler pack - this was terrible. The first thing I noticed about this beer while pouring it was the dead gnat that poured into the glass. I wasn''t going to drink it, but Dogbrick insisted that I try it. yuck. Absolutely terrible. More orange crap.
Jacob Rosenberger & Son Germanic Style Dark;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;"Part of the ""12 Greatest Brews of the World"" sampler pack found at my local Wal-Mart. No matter what the label says, they refuse to be any other color than orange. This beer poured a dark orange with minimal head and lace (+ one insect). The gnat was the most interesting thing about this beer. Practically no aroma (maybe some malt) and I actually thought about putting more insects in the beer so it would actually taste different than all the other Old European brews I have tried so far. No such luck."
Jacob Rosenberger & Son Germanic Style Dark;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Wet cardboard, and again dark as 7-up!!! this isn't even beer!.............
Jacob Rosenberger & Son Germanic Style Dark;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Cold Spring Brewery;Probably the best of the self proclaimed 12 greatest beers. They are all absolutely horrible. I suppose i knew that when brock picked it up from of all places, Sams club. The thing about all 12 of these brews is that they all are supposed to be different flavors, but they all taste the same. And really, would the 12 greatest beers actually have twist off caps. The only good thing is that we were hammered when we rated them, so at least our ratings are interesting.

W smaku na poczatku likierowa slodycz, cos jakby porto i polewa czekoladowo-krowkowa na ciescie w ktorym jest mnostwo borowek i jagod. A wiec spora mieszanka ciemnych granatowych owocow, deserowa czekolada i uderzenie alkoholu szlachetnego. Po chwili po przelknieciu posmak slodyczy powoli ustepuje a alkohol blyskawicznie ustepuje tworzac rozgrzewajaca koncowke z lekka nute chmielowosci i palonego slodu. Bardzo zlozone i ciekawe piwo.

Titletown Boxcar Brown Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Titletown Brewing Company;"The brewer's new description of this seasonal reads: ""The Boxcar Brown Ale is a medium bodied ale with a deep brown color and a distinct bitterness. Not to be compared to an English Nut Brown Ale, such as Newcastle. The American Brown is an extremely young beer style developed in the 1970's by homebrewers with a love for hoppy ales. The Boxcar has a 5.4% ABV."" I can vouch for the bitterness, which dominated my impression of the beer, but I only had a sample. If the beer is still there when I next visit Titletown, I'll give a pint a try."

Bull & Bush Man Beer;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;July 3rd, 2015 - Enjoyed at Bull & Bush (a Denver institution in these heady days of breweries opening everywhere). A dark brew with a slight haze (owed in part to the chill) it also features a handsome head, with a bee-hive of bubbles going down a solid inch of the glass. The aroma is lightly malty, but the flavor is more signatory. Lots of bubble gum up front with raspberry and sweet grapefruits, followed by strawberry in the finish. The body is substantial enough to support the brew, too. Nice work from this lodestone of Denver's beer scene!
Bull & Bush Man Beer;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;"Enjoyed on tap at Aviators, Denver Airport. I honestly didn't expect an imperial English IPA when I read the name, but I also didn't ask. That's a ""just go for it"" kind of beer. A clean but dark caramel color pour. Thick tan cream cap head. A quite bitter earthy like constant on the flavor here. Bold and bitter hops jump out front. Bready, earthy malt with almost a spice to it in the finish. I could guess a little rye, but I think I'm wrong based on descriptions. Has that citrus peel like bitterness. Not too bad. It's before 9am and I'm on vacation. It's kinda hard for any beer to be bad at this point. Unique brew here. I enjoyed it."

Bull & Bush Man Beer;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;Bottle from Foothills Liquors. Malty IPA, almost close to an APA, malts dominate the hops. Amber pour with soft creamy head. Aroma leans on the malt bills, as does the taste. Not a hoppy IPA by any means. Yet, tasty in its own right. If you like English, this one’s for you.

Bull & Bush Man Beer;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;16.9 oz. bottle, consumed on 12-20-15. Bottled 9/15/15. Pours an effervescent, clear, dark bronze with a moderate to large amount of beige head. Pretty good lacing. Nice looking beer. Juicy, malty aroma features scents of cotton candy, mango, and mineral water. Malty, boozy taste. Sugary, fruit-juicy. Apricot, toffee, and caramel flavors. Bitter in the finish. Medium body. Smooth in the palate. Acceptable but forgettable palate effects. My guess is that this is past its prime at a little over 3 months old. It’s definitely not bad but probably would have been better a couple of months ago. Between lack of bite from aging hops, the juiciness of the hops that likely have been present from the beginning, and the maltiness of the beer by the standards of the style, the beer simply is sweeter than ideal. Note: Seeing after the fact that this is a British-style IPA makes me think that the flavor effects I’ve experienced were intended and not from fading hops. Regardless, the flavors aren’t great.
Bull & Bush Man Beer;Denver, Colorado, United States;IPA;Bull & Bush Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Pours hazy copper with a fizzy white head.

Bull & Bush The Tower ESB;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bull & Bush Brewery;Deep copper, clear. Light beige head persists well. Aroma: Light cereal note-not unpleasant, moderate caramel, light toffee, aroma hops not really apparent. Flavor: Buttery medium caramel, low pleasant fruity esters, earthy floral hops flavor enriches, Has perhaps a hint of chocolate malt here. Has typical elements of ESB in pretty good balance - no real complaints here. Bittering level is right - bitterness lingers in aftertaste as does slight spiciness (hops). Improves as it warms and malty qualities come forward. Definitely worth a repeat for me (I love British beers in general). BJCP
Bull & Bush The Tower ESB;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bull & Bush Brewery;Bottle. Pours a medium, well retained, ivory head over a slightly hazy medium amber (SRM 12) body.....nose is light cereal, mild toffee/caramel.....taste is moderate roasted grain, cereal, toast, biscuit, slight sweetness of a toffee.caramel, finishing with a moderately bitter, non American hop tone....mouth feel, medium body, minimal astringency. This is a fairly typical ESB, with all of the usual characteristics. It is a bit unclean. BJCP 8/3/14/4/7

Aroma is lightly malty (light bread), moderately hoppy (flowers), with notes of lemon and coriander. Flavor is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Quite light, as designed, but the aroma is fresh and pleasant, and the mouthfeel is quite nice.
Harrington's Ngahere Gold;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Standard longneck, lackluster label. Definitely a strong lager aroma - malty and akin to Baltic, Russian and Soviet Bloc beers that I've had. Clear and specimen colored. Boozy, bocky, medicinal. Slippery mouthfeel with a cough syrup finish. I don't have anything very positive to say about this brew. Pak N Save, Albany, Auckland.
Harrington's Ngahere Gold;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"330ml bottle. Pours pale gold with a bit of haze. Not much but some alcohol on the nose. Not enough of ""Nelson's finest hops"" in here, too mild for the ABV. Disappointing."

Harrington's Ngahere Gold;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Another poor effort from Harrington’s. The only differentiation from their other lagers is the higher alcohol, which is painfully obvious. Very bland.
Harrington's Ngahere Gold;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"It’s hard to be nice about a beer that is only and just about alcohol hidden by malt sweetness, and you can buy that for a bout 1/3 the price in cans from Germany if you wanted. This isn’t good, and I’m not even sue that the name of the beer isn’t a hat-tip to beer to get smashed by. Oh and the brewer just changed the style to ""Strong Lager"" say no more."
Harrington's Ngahere Gold;Christchurch, New Zealand;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Harrington's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml botte, from the comments an interesting history, far more malty than hoppy & hides the alcohol well, not too bad
75th Street Fountain City Amber;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;75th Street Brewery;On tap @ 75th Street. Brownish amber appearance with an off white head. Caramel, nuts, and amber malts in the nose. Pretty hoppy bitter, caramel malty flavor. I think the hops are a little overdone.
75th Street Fountain City Amber;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;75th Street Brewery;Tap at Blue Moose. Straight forward amber ale. Taste malt, little bit of silkiness in the end. Not too serious, but went nice with my burger.
75th Street Fountain City Amber;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;75th Street Brewery;Sampled on draft at 75th Street in KC. Pours clear, amber-brown with a thick white head and nice lacing. Aroma is one-dimensional: caramel malts. Flavor is slightly bitter with notes of plum. Good malt backbone. Quite clean and dry. Medium-bodied and lightly carboanted. A solid Irish-style ale.
75th Street Fountain City Amber;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;75th Street Brewery;Good amber ale. Nothing spectacular. They also serve this exact beer at Fenton’s and call it Fenton’s Aviator Amber Ale. It’s an average to above average amber ale with a little hoppiness to it. Slight citrus flavor to it makes it an enjoyable brew.
75th Street Fountain City Amber;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;75th Street Brewery;Very fine carbonation and head. Hazy orange-red color. Caramel malt aroma, with a tad of hops. Flavor is mostly sweet, caramel-apple maltiness, but there are some earthy hops for balance's sake. Light bodied. Some citrus and apricot are apparent here, too. Long finish. Very odd gaseous nasal passage-filling sensation, I suppose this is the carbonation? Most unusual effect.
Gick-Bräu Weisse;Burgkunstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gick-Bräu;Yeasty, herbal aroma with citrus. Sweetish, yeasty taste, with citrus and pear. A bit thin, but refreshing.

Schinner Altfranken Braunbier;Bayreuth, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Bürgerbräu Bayreuth;Pours - guess what - brown with a beig head. Malty aroma. Taste is also more on the malty end, goes along with some spice bute on a very mild scale, thus very drinkable when you're thirsty.

Sherwood Forest Archers Ale;Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sherwood Forest Brewers;Rated on 9-28-2010. This bottled beer pours a huge very fizzy beige head with a short retention, hazy amber body, suspended carbonation, and no lacing. The aroma is caramel malt, earthy, grassy, and herbal hops. The taste is earthy, grassy, caramel malt, and lightly bitter. The palate is tingly and this beer is medium bodied. This is a beer that I will not drink again as it lacks character, no WOW factor and the flavor was very bland.
Sherwood Forest Archers Ale;Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sherwood Forest Brewers;Another decent looking beer, but a bit of a let down after that. Aroma is flat, not much smell, but not funky either. Taste is malt with a bit of tang on the tail end (hops?). Slightly sweet and dry finish.
Sherwood Forest Archers Ale;Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sherwood Forest Brewers;Poured light amber with white head. Minimal hops, light to medium body, smooth malt taste. Drinkable beer
Sherwood Forest Archers Ale;Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sherwood Forest Brewers;12 oz. Dark brownish amber pour wih a tan head. Smell is traditional. Dominated by English yeast. HAs dark fruits, some mustiness, dustiness, slightly tart aroma. Malt and hops are mild and add a backing to the yeast. Th flavor tart and fruity, lots of berries, medium to low bitterness, yest is there but milder. Not bad, but perhaps a bit sweet and tangy.
Sherwood Forest Archers Ale;Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sherwood Forest Brewers;12 oz bottle pours a hazt brown with a fair off-white head and some lacing - looks liked iced tea. Aroma is full of wood, test, vegetables and hops -kind of weird, but not bad. Has a woody.nutty taste with a slightly bitter finish. Body is thin to medium. My rating would be higher if I took into account the bargain price of this one: about half of what others on the same shelf cost. The best $4.99 6-pack I’ve enjoyed in years.
Sherwood Forest Archers Ale;Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sherwood Forest Brewers;Pours cloudy tea-brown with an equally ice tea-like bit of foam on top. Scent is caramel, toffee, malt....bread. Taste is a slight bitter wood, caramel.....nutty More like a brown ale. Pretty tasty.
Sherwood Forest Archers Ale;Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sherwood Forest Brewers;"Hazy, deep amber and brown coloured body with a thick, rich, dense, long-lasting tan head. Aroma of soap, caramel, apricots, pears, apples, toffee, light hops and a bit of malt. Medium-bodied; Assertive pear, apple and fruity flavours with a hint of caramel, toffee and a bit of earthiness on the back end. Aftertaste shows some sweetness, a lot of earthy and bready malts with a little hit of low alpha acid hops with a faint bit of soap at the very end. Overall, an okay english pale with more emphasis on the complexity than the hops or malt, but the flavours match up fairly well, just the complexity in this seems to be a deterrent from a typical beer of this style. I sampled this 12 ounce bottle purchased from Oliver’s Beverage in Albany, New York on 18-November-2011 for US$2.15 sampled at home in Washington on 27-November-2011."
Sherwood Forest Archers Ale;Marlborough, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Ale - English;Sherwood Forest Brewers;Nice aroma of yeast, bread, wood, and a little caramel. Unfortunately, after a promising start the taste disappoints. Weak, watery, somewhat vegetal flavor. Probably OK with food, but doesn’t really stand out on its own.

Apollo Lys Weissbier;Copenhagen, Denmark;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bryggeriet Apollo;On tap at Sct Clemens. It ours a hazy yellow-orange body anda big, dense, off-white head. It’s lightly acidic on the nose, making me think it’s nit only the regular weissbier lemon showing up. Some wheat, but not much of the usual banana, cloves and bubble-gum. Lemony acidity on the flavour with some pale malts underneath. Quite tart on the palate, medium body and lightly effervescent. Lemony and orangey finish.

Rio Grande;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);The Canadian version of a cervesa/ corona style beer. The last time I had this little gem was I think the summer of 97. It was sold out everywhere at the time. I liked it better than Corona actually. My tasted have changed quite a bit since then.
Rio Grande;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Very sweet and bland in aroma and flavour. Clear golden with fizzy white fully diminishing head. Light, watery body with fair carbonation. Not offensive but very, very bland. Entered from notes.
Rio Grande;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);One of the worst beer i ever tasted. A la Corona style but not as good. Very pathetic stuff. Dont try it.
Rio Grande;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);"Travelling through Quebec on a hot summer day my wife and I stop off to buy some beer. There's a nice selection in the the store and my wife says ""oh this looks like Corona, let's get this"" So, yes, it does resemble Corona, but just not as good. Is this the same stuff sold in Ontario as Brava??"
Rio Grande;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);(Bottle) Remember it stating 4.9%ABV not that it would make this beer tast better. Pathetic beer. Much like the brewer - Lakeport. Who'd want another Corona knock-off...

Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Total shit. On this special occasion of reviewing this sewage i actually disgraced my glass by dumping in this garbage. Monster blinding white foamy head probally caused from 355ml of beer hitting the glass in less than a second. Smells bad, tastes bad and very empty - just like any other less than low quality S. American beer brewed in a plastic pail. Almost invisible in colour, this is a harsh stinky grainy beer that even a lemon or a pail of sand couldnt help. Unfourtunatly it’s drinkable, but barely AND I didn’t flush it - it’s not bad enough to be flushable. 138% unsatisfying. I’ve said too much. Total waste of money. Stupid bottle collection.
Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);From the beers of the world box. Do all these SABMiller Central and South American beers come from the same tanker truck and simply have different labels. As usual, light yellow, no head, and the aroma of corn. Watery mouthfeel. No flavor to speak of and a bland finish.
Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);12oz bottle from trader Joe’s. Yellow with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. Light, skunky and veggie aroma. The flavor is almost non-existent and a little off in general. Quite watery stufff. The bottom of the barrel for Central-American stuff. I’ve got the light version on deck though so...
Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Pours a banana yellow with a small, fizzy head. No aroma detectable. Flavor is almost non-existent. This must be the MGD of Latin America, judging by the fact that the absolute minimum of the lowest quality ingredients were used. Pass on this. Overall, poor+.
Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle out of the Beers of the World multi-pack from Cost Plus. Do all pale lagers from Central America taste the same? Gold in color with a slight bitter finish. This is what I would call a beach beer. Great on a warm summer day. I just rated Caballo and it tasted almost exaclty the same.
Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Has a poor aroma with very little to greet the nose and no hops or malt. The color is a very light yellow almost nonexistent and the head goes away as fast as you pour the beer and is white. Flavor is bland absent of any malt or hop charateristics.
Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);One of the burdens of RateBeer addiction is buying crap beer because, hey it might be a new country, then logging on and finding out that not only is not a new country, but you already had three crap beers from that stoopid country. Arriba is from the SABMiller production line in El Salvador that brought you Cantina and Cabana. Judging by the pictures here on RateBeer, they all come in the same Corona-inspired clear bottles and have fairly similar ABVs. A look at the brewer’s page confirms that the Cerveceria La Constancia spits out dozens of these lagers with vaguely exotic names, which means at some point in the future I’ll find myself buying Tocayo or Bareno or Caballo because hey, it might be a new country. Arriba, funnily enough is remarkably similar to Cantina and Cabana. It smells like the interior of a new car with lots of factory-fresh vinyl and three tyres on fire. The dog in the backseat has been for a swim and wet himself when he realised the car was on fire. There’s a sheep back there and it hasn’t been sheared in... oh... at least three years, so the lanolin is ripe. The beer tastes heaps better than it smells. So does toe-jam. It’s one of those malt-and-hop-free lagers that appeal to people who don’t much care for beer unless there’s something else in it to take away the bitter taste. Corona drinkers. Shandy drinkers. Fortunately, SABMiller has done most of the work for them. Good old SABMilller. I look forward to buying Carriba, Carena and Tocata in the near future. Soon as I’ve got rid of this nasty smell. (355ml bottle from Liquor on Parade, KIngsford. Best Before May 09 or ideally never)
Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Bottle: Clean, crisp, slightly hopped. Medium body and refreshing. Typical Pale Lager.

Arriba;San Salvador, El Salvador;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cerveceria La Constancia (AB InBev);Soon as I sighted the faux Corona bottle and gaudy pyramid on the front I suspected this would be bad. I was not disappointed. Tastes of corn fired cheap alcohol. Had no head at all. Difficult to discern any hops at all in this. I’ll even drink VB over this. Awful.

Cottage Southern Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask at the Eagle, Cambridge. Golden, clear. A bit of white head and loads of lacing. Smells of light orchard fruit, wildflowers and a bit if cleaning fluid. Taste is malty malty malty and sweet. Only a bitter-sour note in the watery short finish. An average and somewhat boring bitter.
Cottage Southern Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;On cask at Black Lion, Consall Forge. Pours amber with white head. Quite a malty session bitter, decent enough.
Cottage Southern Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Another ’samey’ beer from Cottage: they produce hundreds (or so it seems) of brews that look, smell and taste very similar, this sits nicely within that range. Nothing wrong with the beer, it just doesn’t need a new name every time they brew it! Maybe I’m being unkind, because I’ve had some great beers from this brewery over the years. Anyway, this is a bog standard session ale and more than OK in all aspects, slightly more hoppy than malty, a well practised blend that works well for the brewery.
Cottage Southern Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;"Cask at the Bird in Hand, Knowl Hill. A hazy pale amber pour with a loose white head; fruity aroma; very thin with a diluted fruit squash taste - so dilute in fact that it wasn’t possible to decide on what the fruit actually was; and a lacklustre biscuity finish. Not the best bitter."
Cottage Southern Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Copper amber in colour without a head. Has an easy drinking texture but lacks any character. Maybe the slightest of fruits in its aroma.
Cottage Southern Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask, The Crown, Nuneaton. Dusty gold, not much head. Heavily buttered aroma. Buttered sultana flavour, honey. The customary blandness. Very tired but drinkable.
Cottage Southern Bitter;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask conditioned handpump Great Eastern Brighton. A brown beer with an off-white puddle of head.

New York Harbor Amber Ale;Staten Island, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yankee Brewing Company;Old notes from 1999: Gold with a white head. This one is caramelly and sweet with some grassy hints and some fruity touches on the finish.

New York Harbor Amber Ale;Staten Island, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yankee Brewing Company;"Spot-on amber colour with a thin but soapy-large-bubbled off-white head. Aroma of light malt, a small amount of caramel and not much else...fairly light as well. Light-bodied; Taste of water with a bit of malt. Seriously, the taste is completely absent from this one. Aftertaste is nothing just like the inital taste. Overall, this one needs rework before they think they can sell a bunch of it. People will buy one or two, and thats it...because it isn't good. I bought this twelve ounce bottle from Beers of the World, but I would not reccomend you to do the same :-)."
New York Harbor Amber Ale;Staten Island, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yankee Brewing Company;Slightly stale vegetable aroma with tinges of metal. Very light copper appearance, thin head with thin lacing. Very thin and watery overall. Slight nutty flavor is about the only thing going for this. Metallic finish.
New York Harbor Amber Ale;Staten Island, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yankee Brewing Company;Green peanut, vegetable, lagerish aroma. Ding for the screwoff cap, label is lacking, true amber color. Peanutty, lightly sweet, not much bittering. A wee, wee bit of fruit. Yawn.
New York Harbor Amber Ale;Staten Island, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yankee Brewing Company;Found this in bottles while in Staten Island. Pours a very normal looking amber. Clear, with a light misting of white head. Aroma is slightly malty and sweet. Hops are mild and seem to compliment the malt well. Flavor is malty, with a bit of a doughy flavor. It was kind of wierd and unimpressive. Kind of dull and unassuming. Balance is great, body is light, and carbonation is mild to high, which is not my cup of tea. Made me burp like crazy.
New York Harbor Amber Ale;Staten Island, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yankee Brewing Company;Had this on tap at the Liberty Heights Tap Room in Brooklyn. Nice clean crisp Amber. Nothing wrong with it. Had worse. Had Better.
New York Harbor Amber Ale;Staten Island, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yankee Brewing Company;Extremely Hoppy ale, really quite bitter and fairly good . Must be drank on tap at a S.I. Yankees ballgame to be properly enjoyed. Nose is quite redolent of herbs as well. It's not guinness or harp but its still good. Not much head on the beer though.
Lobkowicz Bohemian Ranger;Vysoky Chlumec, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Vysoký Chlumec (Pivovary Lobkowicz);"Bottled: Impressive ruby red coloured. Light brownish head. What a nose. Sweets, hops, spices and chocolate lingers pleasantly in your nostrils. Makes you wan't to ""sniff"" forever. Flavour is not equally good. Some roastyness, bites of hops and some maltyness that transfer into a pleasant dry bitterness in the end. Some bite in the mouthfeel. This is a very good dunkel. One of the best bottled I've tried."
Lobkowicz Bohemian Ranger;Vysoky Chlumec, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Vysoký Chlumec (Pivovary Lobkowicz);"I agree with Austinpowers; this is a beer whose idiosyncracies are endearing. Malt out the wazoo, nice body as a result, but with a nice hint of Saaz. This kind of old-school Czech dark lager always makes me think of the Good Soldier Svejk, the Czech equivalent of Homer Simpson, and his beer-soaked exploits in the hinterlands of the Hapsburg Empire..."
Lobkowicz Bohemian Ranger;Vysoky Chlumec, Czech Republic;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Pivovar Vysoký Chlumec (Pivovary Lobkowicz);Oh yeah! Virtually no head, malty and a bit flat. I know that doesn't sound real good, but trust me. This beer makes my short list of really tasty dark lagers! Don't be afraid of the dark!
Taylors Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;"Very nice dark golden color, draft. Not much of aroma. Taste is lite sweetness and sligth bitter. Lite body. Slick and abrupt. Tastes soapy. Watered down beer. Description says intense hop palate; I think my tap water is more intense than this. Did they forget to add the hops?"
Taylors Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Lightly hazed, pale copper appearance. Citrussy aroma, fruity orange. Orange and lemony flavor, mild biscuity malt. Citrus and light greafruit in the finish.
Taylors Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Tap at brewpub. Nice clear copper color with a reasonable off-white head and some lacing. Mild malty aroma - not much else. Indistinct pale ale flavor, little bit of maltiness, little bit of hoppiness, thin and watery. Thin body and pleasant carbonation. This would definitely be a non-challenging, drink in quantity San Diego warm evening brew.
Taylors Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Taylor’s. Poured a medium orange color with a very small off white head. Ligh hops (citrus and maybe some flowers). No real flavors or aromas stand out. Watery body. Nothing special.
Taylors Pale Ale;San Diego, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;I'm sorry but...NOT A PALE ALE imo, grappish aroma with a pale color and small head, unpleasant acidic/bitter hop taste (what type of hops I do not know, but stay away), Just not a pale ale experience in the least
Taylors Amber;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at brewery in Mission Beach, CA: Amber color, light head/lacing. Nose of grassy hops, nutty caramel malt and diacetyl. The flavor is decent with some chewy body and a light bitterness. Dusty stale finish. Not good to drink either. Old lines?
Taylors Amber;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Lightly hazed reddish brown. Sweet fruity aroma. Light fruit palate, pretty sweet, touches of caramel. A fairly mild straightforward amber.
Taylors Amber;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;(Draft: Taylor’s Restaurant and Brewery in San Diego, CA) Just a few blocks from my home, and 1/2 a block from the beach, Taylor’s is still one of those places I rarely visit. But on this glorious Sunday afternoon, I’m sittin’ on the rooftop deck, enjoying the sunshine and crashing waves. Unfortunately, I’m can’t say I’m enjoying the beer nearly as much. This amber is moderately malty, lightly toasty, but with barely any sweetness. It’s tangy and fairly bitter, but not especially hoppy per se. The aroma is lightly malty and equally lightly hoppy. Medium amber color and slightly hazy in the sunshine. Light tan head is small, but the beer was served right to the top of the pint glass, so who knows how much head would normally be present if left to its own devices. I had to check to see if this was an amber ale or lager, because it surely tastes more like a lager to me, but nope, it’s an ale all right.
Taylors Amber;San Diego, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Slightly hazy copper color, long lasting off--white head with some lacing.

Taylors Nut Brown;San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Called James Brown Draft at brewery in Mission Beach, CA: Mahogany color, ruby edges, thick retentive head, very thick. The nose is dusty with some roast and oats in the taste. The flavor is lightly hoppy with a smooth creamy mouthfeel like nitro but it’s not. Best of the bunch.
Taylors Nut Brown;San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at brewpub. My favorite of the Taylors offerings. Dark brown, clear with mahogany highlight. Pleasing rasty malt aroma, almost porterish. Lots of flavor compared to other brews, roasty malts, good bitterness, hints of charcoal and chocolate. Nice smooth mouthfeel, medium to full body and pleasant carbonation.
Taylors Nut Brown;San Diego, California, United States;Brown Ale;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Nice brown color with a thin but disappearing head, slightly nutty aroma, Bitter but roasted nut flavor and a noticeable alcohol background, slightly hoppy finish
Taylors Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;I hate it when a brewer sasy their beer is a German Hefe, but it tastes like an American Wheat. Pour is cloudy gold with a decent white head. Aroma is all wheat. No banana, cloves, or yeast in the flavor. All wheat and honey. Blahhhh.
Taylors Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at brewery in Mission Beach, CA: Light hazy yellow, no head. Nose of rotten fruit and spoiled wheat. Smelling this conjures up the memory about how prone rye is to botulism. Ugh. The wheat is crap, the flavor is dirty with honey and wheat husk and all sorts of bad things. Wow, bad, couldn’t finish without gagging.
Taylors Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Clouded yellow appearance. Mildly spiced clove aroma. Fairly well spiced palate, clove and white pepper, not much else though.

Taylors Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Taylor’s. Poured a medium, hazy yellow with a small white head. Subtle aromas and tastes of fruits and spices. Thin body.
Taylors Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled at the Pizza Port Strong Ale Fest 2003. Light gold color, Medium head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. A medium bodied Hefeweizen. This is more like a pilsner than a hefe, as there was no real banana and clove thing going. But it is a big bold pilsner at that. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. Nicely balanced. Smooth taste. Wish more people would make this kind of pilsner/hefe. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter
Taylors Hefeweizen;San Diego, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Cloudy/Tang-like appearance...Orange juice/wheaty flavor, orange soda-like aftertaste, One of the best at Terrific Pacific and I hate Hefeweizens, so...That's not saying too much
Taylors Strawberry Blonde;San Diego, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylors Restaurant & Brewery;Artificial strawberry aroma, golden color with a lasting white head, flavor very similiar to freezer burnt strawberry ice cream...ending in a bitter hoppy finish
La Rulles Brune;Rulles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles;Tap at Hoppy Corner, Paris, 13th November 18. Pours a brown see through beer.

La Rulles Brune;Rulles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles;From the 75cl bottle. Pours brown with a frothy beige head. Earthy, smoky aroma. Peat. Moor. Smoke. Taste is bittersweet, rich, earthy, malty. Body is medium. Balanced carbonation. Right up my alley.
La Rulles Brune;Rulles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles;Robe brun rouge, un peu voilée par de fins flocons de levure, très jolie mousse brunâtre, un peu visqueuse et assez durable. Nez original, notes boisées et vineuses qui se mêlent au malt, du fruit sec (noisette, pruneau, une pointe d'olive !). En bouche c'est assez corpulent sans être vraiment sucré : le boisé et le toasté viennent vite, pour équilibrer l'ensemble, qui devient facilement buvable. Comme une dubbel en plus léger, avec des arômes particuliers, dont cette olive qui ressort pas mal au nez. C'est plutôt agréable, manque peut-être un poil de richesse.
La Rulles Brune;Rulles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles;Mooi biertje van een vriend bij de bierkoning voor me verjaardag. Alleen kwam er tot mijn schrik achter dat deze ook nog dezelfde maand gedronken moest worden. Oftewel perfect gerijpt :-) Eerste indruk mooie lichte stout. Licht geurend naar koffie. Proef koffie, chocolade, notig. Vrij soepel maar redelijk moutig en een romige koffie kraag die zo fijntjes in van die mooie laagjes aan je glas blijft plakken. Fantastische donkere kleur met bezinksel wat eigenlijk ook wel bij dit type bier hoort en zeker naar deze perfecte rijpings periode. lol Vol van smaak en redelijk bitter, droog maar echt wel een mooie koffie boost. Het soepele geeft deze stout wat frisheid en ergens zelfs iets van doordrinkbaarheid. Maar waarom staat deze jongen als Belgian Ale??? Fact check: Volgens Wikipedia een Belgisch bier van hoge gisting dan nog zou ik hem meer stouterig beoordelen en dit alles met maar 6,5%. Proefglas 7-4-8-4-16
La Rulles Brune;Rulles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles;"29 April 2018, at Zythos Bierfestival. Deputy Taster: Anke. Hazy dark brown with a lasting, foamy, tan head; lots of lacing. Aroma of caramel, herbs, yeast, raisin, licorice, roasted nuts, cinnamon, coffee with a cookie. It tastes light to medium malty sweet, some raisin & licorice, and light to medium roasted bitter, bit nutty. Not too dry, toasty, herbal hop finish. Medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation. Pleasantly surprised by this brewery; you get so much at only 6.5%."
La Rulles Brune;Rulles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;Brasserie Artisanale de Rulles;Bottiglia 75 cL, casa. Colore bruno molto scuro, con lievi riflessi rubino. Schiuma marrone chiaro, soffice, persistente e irregolare. Aromi classici e molto delicati: pane, canditi e lievito. In bocca ha un corpo fantastico, con il malto protagonista. Dolce ma non troppo (al punto giusto). Lievi sentori tostati. É anche molto fresca e l'alcol non è per nulla invadente. Luppolo quasi assente. Ho trovato questa birra molto più dissetante che altre birre nello stesso stile.

Lindens Bebop Blonde;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;On tap: About average. Lots of carbonation, head quickly diminshing. Pale, golden color. Reasonably bitter. Watery. The brewery has a nice atmosphere.
Lindens Bebop Blonde;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Draught. Body is light yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie), lightly hoppy (perfume, herbs), with a light note of honey. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Lindens Bebop Blonde;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;"I'm always curious to try ""Blondes"" because the style is so wildly interpreted. You get anything from an ""American Standard Lager"" to a hoppy ""Pilsner."" This one was decently flavored; a little rich and somewhat hopped with bitterness. Not bad, but not too good either."
Lindens Bebop Blonde;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;You already know what this is - Linden's nod to the unitiated. Predictable sweet carboardy mash with a grandfather's beery aroma.
Lindens Honey Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Nice cloudy orange appearance and some fruity-citrus action, but mostly bland, boring fare.
Lindens Acoustic Amber Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;"Cracker-like malt. Dry, bread-like, puckering bitterness in the finish. Sounds bad, but I actually enjoyed it a little in a sick sorta way. Yeah, I tasted the ""charred almonds,"" as hennes writes, now that I think about it. Nice observation."
Lindens Acoustic Amber Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lindens Brewing Company;Now we're getting somewhere. The first three, lighter Linden's brews are rather weak, but this one has a good roast nuttiness, like slightly charred almonds, and decent hop edges. A big upgrade from its three ugly stepsisters.
Stone Ruination IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;14-OCT-2019, draft @Stone Brewing Escondido. Clear, dark golden, low, white head. Very very bitter. Dank, piney. Citrus, malt. Sweet, oily, bitter. Good.
Stone Ruination IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;Pours hazy amber with a huge white head. Aroma of tropical fruit notes and sweet malt. Taste has sharp hop bite on the tongue, pine and resin. Palate has sweet tropical notes overlaying the pine bite. Really good.
Stone Ruination IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;Au nez c’est frais, ça appelle les agrumes. Belle robe jaune orangée assez limpide (pour une DIPA), avec un col mousseux persistant. En bouche, l’amertume est forte et boisée, elle enrobe tout avec une longueur très juste. Les saveurs évoquent plutôt les fruits blancs, pêchés et litchis avec des arrières goût un brin résineux. Bien rond, bien fort, superbe équilibre, très bonne dipa
Stone Ruination IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;From the backlog, on tap. Pours hazy yellow orange, white head. Citrus, pine resin, rind, melon, orange, light booze. One of the OGs!
Stone Ruination IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;bottle from lcbo. Looking forward to this. I’m tiring of fruit injected lactose bombs & a big older school bitter blast sounds appealing. Frothy soap style suds across the golden. Dank, resin hop bomb as bitter as a republican on Martin Luther King day. I like that (the bitterness, not the racist). The hops fill the mouth with a nice relentless edge. Close to punishing finish. Love it. Sure, the bitterness drowns nuance of flavour & aroma but it’s a nice change up from the current fads.
Stone Ruination IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;Can 33cl. Golden with a foamy white head. Citrus aroma, buxus, pine and more hops. Nice rich taste. Firm bitter and a long finish. Really nice beer.

Stone Ruination IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;One of the hoppiest, bitterest, IPAs out there. Major floral and grapefruit hops in this one. Still has some malty caramel flavors in the end, but hops is the theme here for sure. Appearance is not as orange as some other IPAs, but not not one of those pale yellow one either....somewhere in between. I prefer my IPAs just a tad less bitter, but if looking for a hop bomb, this could be the one. Not sure if it's quite a double IPA though.
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;GABF '03. Golden color with floral hop nose. Thin pale head. Hoppy taste but nothing more. Could use a bit more malt.
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium amber. Aroma is moderately hoppy (orange/apricot, grapefruit, resin), lightly malty (cookie), light note of alcohol. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Competent American-style IPA...reasonable malt backbone, and better balanced than your average AmerIPA (though still pretty citric), but still doesn't quite have what it takes to rock my world.
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;Sweet candyish malts and hops intertwine - the hops are kind of raw and earthy, bitter, yes, but vegetabley. I like this a lot. Body kind of thick, but clear. Thanks Ringo!
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;I was never that impressed with Linden's brewpub offerings (I live a just a few miles from the pub). They recently went of business, and this was their first (and last) bottled beer. Too bad, because this is pretty damn good!
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;GABF 2003: Clear orange color, hoppy pine aroma. Full bodied and thick. Ends bitter with a long hoppy aftertaste.
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;Medium gold hue. Floral hop aroma. Good basic IPA aroma and flavor, not overdone. Sugar sweetness, with only mild bitterness, and a slight scotch like flavor.
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;Excellent sweet/hoppy aroma. Amber in color. Flavor is very good with a nice level of hoppiness mixed with a sweeter floral flavor. The beer feels good in the mouth - a good IPA.
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;The beer is slightly hazy in appearance, with a lingering head, and a nice sweet/hoppy smell. The initial flavor is bittersweet, followed by a strongly hop-bitter middle, and a pleasant finish. a very strong palate, overall the taste is bittter and sweet, a good IPA
Lindens 8-Track IPA;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;IPA;Lindens Brewing Company;Good. Tending toward the sweet side but a solid effort. I'm warming to this brewery now after a few lackluster earlier samplings.
Lindens Encore Abbey;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lindens Brewing Company;Dark brown. Mild soapy and floral aroma. Big banana flavor up front, good body with a syrup-tasting plum finish. Rich.
Lindens Encore Abbey;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lindens Brewing Company;A floral smell, hint of bannanas and cinnamon. Three is a strong bannana flavor, and a bit too much sugar. seems to be trying too hard to cover the alcohol.
Lindens Encore Abbey;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lindens Brewing Company;Very appealing aroma that is sweet and fruity. Appearance is a nice dark amber color. Flavor is slightly malted with a definite nutty/fruity flavor. The palate is full and the beer feels good on the tongue. I've only tried one other Abbey (New Belgium), but I definitely like this one.
Lindens Encore Abbey;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lindens Brewing Company;"Golden-orange; surprisingly light in color. Slightly hazy, almost clear. No head to speak of. Peculiar, strange, atypical, astringent, bitter, overly carbonated, and sour in many wrong ways. Seemed very undone and green to me. Did I catch them at a bad time... or bad batch?"
Lindens Encore Abbey;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lindens Brewing Company;With New Belgium just down the road this is an audacious entry, and they do fine. The beer is big on cinnamon and and more sharply sugary than I like, but it has a nice round malty body and masks alcohol with the best of them.
Lindens Big Band;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lindens Brewing Company;Tasted 10-7-2002, The main thing I remember about this beer was that it had an amazing aroma, almost exactly like a rose, it was incredible. The taste was also very good. Super beer all around.
Lindens Big Band;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lindens Brewing Company;Medium to dark ruby color. Boring at first, somewhat sickly, goes to cherries and honey and strawberries, and then finally a bit cloying before and unexpectedly wet finish full of cherries and honey. I can feel the alcohol in my nose. Nice, but nose my ideal barley wine.
Lindens Big Band;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lindens Brewing Company;A slightly bitter smell, a sweet cherry/berry flavoring. The palate was too thin though. overall it lacked a lot in body.
Lindens Big Band;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lindens Brewing Company;Sweet aroma dominated by a cherry/vanilla smell. Appearance is coppery in color. Flavor is mostly berries but with a definite alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is average.
Lindens Big Band;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lindens Brewing Company;"A ruby-red orange with obnoxiously thick cream puff lacing. Aroma of the usual plus almonds, bubblegum and watermelons; not exactly what I was expecting. Flavor is indeed a big apricot bomb plus a helping pears, along with medicinal/gauze flavors. Faint flowers and cherry cough syrup round out the swallow. This has little body for a barley, yet somehow manages to coat your mouth with its overwhelming sweetness."
Lindens Big Band;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lindens Brewing Company;Clear copper with frothy lace. Super-sweet and sugary-smelling nose. Dried fruit flavors exuded. Very smooth nectar with a heavy mouthfeel. Intensely flavored and rich. One of Linden's best, that I tried.
Lindens Big Band;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Lindens Brewing Company;Huge rasberry nose and flavour. Huge. I mean, this thing is malt infused razbry juice with interesting edges from hops, smoke, and alocohol. Very smooth, too, as the commercial description suggests. Aphrodiasiac? Well, you'll have to ask brownalegirl about that ...
Big Horn Mantis Belgian Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);Taking a stab at the abbey style - I suppose living in the shadow cast by NB's success, many western brewpubs will take this shot. Mantis is a decent effort, lighter and easier to deal with than most beers of the type - kind of a belgian lite, but with enough spicy character to keep me interested.
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;Urdålig, vem vill dricka denna kombination som smakar så urvattnat dåligt och tråkigt.
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;Certainly better than the Spendrups pale lager, but still nothin exceptional. It has a copper tone and more body, aroma and aftertaste is short.
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;Golden-brown with a low head. Malty aroma of caramel, nuts and corn. The flavour is sweet, metallic and a bit sour.
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;Can, 500ml, 2000-08-08, don’t bye this horrible mix. Why should you want to mix a ale with a lager?
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;500 ml can. A small beige head upon a clear, deep copper colored body. Modest aroma of nutty malts and cream-caramel. Whiffs of dark dried fruits. Much of the same in the flavor, with mild bittering hops and some notes of honey and fruity acidity in addition. Dry and acidulous mouthfeel. Light-bodied with short bitterish end.
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;0,5l can from a system bolaget in Stockholm. very good experiment from Spendrups. The lightness though a bit watery and delicious hops with caramel and beautiful dark amber colour: I want more of this.
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;Bottle. Pours a dark amber colour with a white head. Thin on the nose. Some caramel and bread. Flavour is a bit sweet and malty. Just a hint of bitterness. I did not enjoy this one all that much.
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;This mix between an ale and a lager has a dark amber color and an OK head. The aroma has notes of caramel and a bit of fruit. The flavour is a bit weak with notes of caramel, light fruit and citrus and the finish is unbalanced with too heavy grapefruit notes. 1920
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;50cl bottle at Botulfs on August 21, just found it on here today after much searching. Clear copper with a small head. So-so malts with some caramel, and a little hop balance. Nothing exciting, but drinkable, and good compared to the other Spendrups beers Ive had sinse. What I really want to know is where can I get a Spendrups scotch ale? I’m thinking that if you took the Spendrups lager out, you could have a solid beer.
Fifty Fifty;Grängesberg, Sweden;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Spendrups Bryggeri;50 cl. can. Pours an amber colour with a short head. Aroma of caramel and toasted malt. The flavour is a bit sweet with caramel, toasted malt and some fuitiness. Toastish finish.

Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;(Can 50 cl) 5,5% ABV in my version. Beautiful, fully golden brew with a small head. Nice full body and a clearly marked bitterness, but not overly bitter. A decent strong lager. 240901
Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;5.5%, 550 ml can. I couldn’t say I didn’t like it: it was quite full-bodied, juicy and slightly alcoholic, but this alcohol bitterness served very well in the palate.
Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;Canned. Blue Tiger turned Blue Zebra. Swedish fotballers started out as zebras but acted like tigers on the pitch in the second half. The aftertaste in that game wasn’t as sour as this beer. Sweden-Italy 1-1. Yihaa!
Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;Blond beer with a small head. Weak aroma.The taste is light malty and a bit sweet. The finish is neutral. Tasteless name and the same goes for the design of the can.
Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;Golden colour. Small bubbly head. Sweet malty aroma. Notes of corn and pear. Very sweet malty flavour. Notes of rotten apples/pear. Suddenly I expected a worm would come out of the dark hole of the can. It just tasted so sweet and nasty.
Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;Canned. Aka as Blue Zebra. An international standard lager. A bit sweetish and malty.
Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;My beer was named Blue Zebra, but I guess it is the same. Or at least very similar, why would Spendrups shock us and suddenly change anything else but the cans when they make different beers. This ons is very sweey and sugary. Flavor is very sweet as well, and I think there wasa touch of glue(!?) in it.
Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;Boring lager with an unpleasant bitterness and some notes of green apples...
Blue Tiger;Grängesberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Spendrups Bryggeri;Pale golden coloured cheaply made lager. Grainy aroma. Thin and sharp, rather sweet with low bitterness. Substandard.
Giron;Gällivare, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Gellivare Bryggeri;Pale yellow. Dry, medium bitterness. Neutral but with some apple aroma......
Jahki Dálvi;Gällivare, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gellivare Bryggeri;Golden brown with small creamy head. Caramel aroma. There is a slightly sweet start, some spice and a bitter, well balanced finish.
Jahki Dálvi;Gällivare, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gellivare Bryggeri;Pale amber. There is a hint of grassy hop aroma in the nose. Some toffeeish malt character. Not overly bitter finish. Considering the harshness of the winters in Northern Lapland you'd really expect the winter version to be something like World Wide Stout. I wish it was...
Jahki Dálvi;Gällivare, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gellivare Bryggeri;Also Jahki Vinter: Crystal clear dark amber with a medium size and lasting white head and some light lace too. Mild caramel and antiseptic alcohol with hints of fruit and spices aroma. Light body with mild bitter and faint sour palate at the start. Interesting honey, caramel and roasted smokey flavours drift in and out while tasting. Looks adequately carbonated but taste is relatively flat. Middle, finish and aftertaste are a tad bland spoiling what is otherwise quite a pleasant beer..
Jahki Dálvi;Gällivare, Sweden;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Gellivare Bryggeri;The character of this beer change with the seasons. Somtimes somewhat malty and sometimes somwhat hoppy. But basicly it's pretty much the same.

Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Cactus/Lime;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Bottle. Pale green colour without any head. Aroma and flavour of malt, lime and cactus is suppose.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Cactus/Lime;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Extremely sweet in taste. It says beer on the bottle, but this is not beer. Maybe I would have liked it better if my expectations had been different. For some reason I thought it would be remotely similar to beer. It is not.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Cactus/Lime;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Bottled. Pale poisonous green colour, no head to talk about. Artificial lime aroma, cactus maybe closer to the aroma... Flavour is quite the same, extreme sweetness with cactus and lime... refreshing drink while cold, but beer... naaah, rather lemonade...
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Cactus/Lime;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;"Bottled (BB 08/2006) I wanted to celebrate my 200th Swedish rating with something special. And this is it. Pale green, disappearing head. Artificial aroma of lime and sugar. Very sweet and sugary, artificial ""cactus"" flavor. Nothing to do with beer, no taste of malts nor hops. Sugary lemonade."
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Cactus/Lime;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;The aroma is fresh with notes of lime - somewhat artificial. The color is clear green with no head. The flavor is also somewhat artificial with lime notes. A very refreshing drink - but nothing a beer geek will go crazy about.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Cactus/Lime;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Dangerous light green colour. If it did not say on the bottle, I would not have noticed that this was a beer.
Kopparbergs Mixed Malt Cactus/Lime;Kopparberg, Sweden;Flavored - Fruit;Kopparbergs Bryggeri;Chernobyl inpsired bright turquoise/green colour, no head. Offensive bubblegum aroma, ridiculously sweet. Liquid candy for kids. Bears not much resemblance to beer, which is probably a good thing considering that this brewery has no clue how to make beer.
Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Tap at Fitger’s on Nov. 17, 2011. Red amber pour with a fluffy cream head. Aroma and taste are very mild caramel and bread. A bit watery.
Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;I love mild. I’ve had some great ones (especially in England). The problem here is that it is too mild--it feels like fluffy water, with a very hollow flavor, like vanilla ice cream whip (the fake ice cream) that doesn’t really melt even when it gets warm. It keeps a light foam head. Not worth the effort. (on tap at brewpub)
Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at the Fitgers Brewhouse in Duluth, MN, pours a coppery brown, almost Irish red, brew with a creamy off white head. Aroma is very light malt, some peat, farm barn mustiness, and a little raisined dark fruit. Taste is slightly sour/bitter, light body and quite watery. Finish is light and dry. Almost falling into the lawnmower beer territory.
Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Dark amber color with faint creamy head. Malty nose, faintly sweet with a raisin character. Slightly bitter malty body that didn’t have a lot going on - watery.

Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Dark brown color with a very creamy Guinness-like head. Just a hint of malt in the aroma. Very earthy and grainy taste. Bitter finish.
Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;Clear dark brown topped witha full finger of super creamy and fine light chocolate head. Aroma of grass, earth, sheep barn, peat and oats. Interesting flavor complex as it warms on the tongue. Eart and grass continues, but backed off by strong diacetyls in the form of rich fresh buttermilk. This fades into a toasty burnt hazlenut profile. Combine all of this with a rindy and musty Cashel Blue cheese in the back ground. This is all riding on a waterfall of rich and bold roasted oats. Watery, lightly carbonated, and light on the alcohol, but very drinkable and smooth, with a smack of hoppy bitterness.
Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;"Salt air aroma, which is fitting. Held up to light, a dark reddish hue is apparent. Head and body similar in appearance to Guinness. Smooth flavor; like the nitro injected Guinness. As advertised, dark in color, but light in body. Drinkable but not all that special."
Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;good for a mild beer...used to work there...good flavor and seeing it get made was cool
Fitgers Mariner Mild;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Mild Ale;Fitgers Brewhouse;First real mild I have had the opportunity to sample, and I'm impressed. Light on the tongue, virtually no hop presence but there is an extremely nice maltiness here. Hints of roasty grains, as well as liquorice and of nuts. This is a high quality beer.
Fitgers Big Boat Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at Republic, pours a deep dark mahogany with a small beige head. Aroma brings out a nice dry oat character upfront, with lightly toasted malt. Flavour is along the same lines, with oats, toasted malt and some earthy, chalky notes. Missing a little sweetness and roast to achieve better depth. Okay.
Fitgers Big Boat Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fitgers Brewhouse;Really nice sweet stout. Deep and chocolatey. More than a little roasty coffee character. Jess and I tried at the brewery in 2018 on our way to Northern Lights.

Fitgers Big Boat Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fitgers Brewhouse;Draft. Black/brown pour, creamy lighter tan colored head. Creamy thicker body for not too big of a stout, cocoa and roasted malt flavors, hint of dark fruit.
Fitgers Big Boat Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fitgers Brewhouse;On draught at Fitger’s. APPEARANCE- Jet black, light nougat colored head with great lacing. NOSE- deep notes of coffee with a smidge of malty sweetness. FLAVOR- coffee blasts into my mouth my with every sip. Roasty malts prevail as the coffee fades into the distance. After suggestion, I taste a bit of dark chocolate residuals in my mouth.
Fitgers Big Boat Oatmeal Stout;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Fitgers Brewhouse;"Growler poured a cl;ear dark reddish brown with a small lasting tan head. Aromas of bakers cocoa, roasted malt, light earthiness and light coffee. Palate was light to medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of roasted malt, bakers cocoa, light coffee and light earthiness with a smooth dry lingering cocoa finish."

Fitgers Farmhouse Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fitgers Brewhouse;"Sold as ""Farmhouse Saison."" On tap at Tycoons, Duluth. Copper color. Lots of coriander and black pepper. This is dry, and even drier in the finish. I also pick up some lemongrass, but i do not think there is actually any in this beer."
Fitgers Farmhouse Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours very hazy yellow with white head into snifter on tap, aroma has notes of bubblegum, barn, sweet fruity citrus, some slight earth. Taste is a bit odd, has sweet notes of fruit and citrus with a slight spice from the yeast, but then stays sweet without the dryness coming in but still has a slight bitterness. Good, but a bit left to be desired.
Fitgers Farmhouse Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fitgers Brewhouse;Golden apricot pour with a milky appearance. Pineapple, coriander and bananas on a nose with a sharp, zesty gin edge. A light, fruity flavor is obscured by a mild cloud of aerosol. Packs a punch even in a small amount. This evolves a bit into more of floral shampoo quality. Grapefruit and cantaloupe notes beside, definitely struggling with a weird IPA identity. Palate is too wet and creamy, with a very bitter bite. No discernable farmhouse qualities for all these hops to play with. Might have been interesting.
Fitgers Farmhouse Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fitgers Brewhouse;On tap at brewery. What a nice suprise this one is. Pours Gold/yellow with a small white head. Nice floral, grassy hop aroma with just a bit of farmhouse funk. Taste is mostly the same, but with a light pepper and coriander spice. This was good.
Fitgers Farmhouse Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fitgers Brewhouse;Pours a clear golden color with about half an inch layer of white foam. The foam quickly settles down to a ring and thin film. A little bit of lace. Good aroma of spice. The taste is of sweet, smooth, malt - with wheat and honey. There is a moderate floral hop presence. And lots of spice throughout. Finishes with a dry spicy coriander and a very subtle alcohol bite. You really notice the spicy saison yeast (I’m guessing WL 550) in this beer. Lightly carbonated and medium body. The spicyness really sticks with you in the aftertaste - very nice. Very drinkable - but watch it - its not a lightweight beer by any means.
Fitgers Farmhouse Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fitgers Brewhouse;Sample, then glass, at the brewpub. Pale golden, opaque and cloudy, swirling yellow starts...the ring of foam lasts indefinitely...soft sweet inviting nose, with ginger and coriander competing gently amidst an orangepeel center...sweet and yeasty initially on the tongue, a sour citrusy backbone is interrupted as it warms by light touches of oregano and tarragon...at the finish, citrusy acid and pepper win over the earthy malts and it goes on, and on, and on....
Fitgers Farmhouse Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fitgers Brewhouse;Cloudy Gold Coloring with Good White Creamy Head. Grassy Saison Aroma. Lightly Hoppy. Upon First Experiencing This Brew on The Tongue...It Tasted Like a Saison...With Many Grassy, Floral Flavors...And After Consuming This Pint, Coriander Became the Dominant Flavor and Made the Grassy Saison Notes Disappear. Light Hoppy Bite to it...Dry Ending But Balanced Overall. You Have to Enjoy the Flavors of a Saison, But Very Enjoyable and Presumably VERY Enjoyable in the Summer over the Winter.
Fitgers Farmhouse Ale;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fitgers Brewhouse;I thought that this was a pleasant beer with nice hops good maltiness and quite a bit of buttery quality. Not sure about the stylistic description. It didn't seem to have any of the yeasty bite that I enjoy from saisons. (Perhaps I was served the pale ale? I did enjoy the beer quite a bit, I'm just not sure it was the saison.)
Fitgers El Nino Double Hopped IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;My ultimate favorite IPA. Fresh. Hoppy. Tastes perfect. Haven't been able to top it's flavor anywhere. Best IPA so far and I've tasted many. I'm 30 yrs old so... ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Fitgers El Nino Double Hopped IPA;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Fitgers Brewhouse;"Draft at the brewery. This is a ruddy-looking beer and starts like many D/IIPAs; overall it’s drinkable, but side by side with their flagship pale ale, I prefer the pale ... this has a nutty aspect that takes over that didn’t tickle my palate in the right way.

Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Originally rated May 2006. Lakeport Light is $24 for 24 bottle (before deposit and taxes). It pours a normal golden lager colour with a white foamy head that dissipates fast enough. One bubble at a time carbonation and very mild soapy lace. Decent aromas, found in a normal lager (5% ABV). Watery mouthfeel. Starts off with some light malt flavour and very slim corn comes out in the aftertaste. An unexpensive, unoffensive light brew, and great for the hockey playoffs.
Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);typical light beer, little flavour, goes down pretty easy, would drink if nothing else was around
Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Tall cans, and 6packs readily available at LCBO or Beer Store locations. Cannot really imagine why anybody would ever buy this stuff, basically just watered down Lakeport which is already like drinking carbonated water. No real smell, look, or taste to it. I guess the one thing it has going for it is that theres nothing noticably offensive about it. It’s just... nothing.
Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);"473 mL Can. Pale straw body with a large fizzy white head that settles to a foamy layer leaving some lace. Aroma is corn husk, wet hay, and musty basement. Corn dominates in the flavor along with corn husk, hay, eau de Hamilton Harbor, little to no aftertaste, and an unpleasant bitter phenolic / chemical / skunky finish. ""Premium Light Beer"", eh! I can’t bait my hook with that; I’ll leave the rest of my pint to the carps that live in Hamilton Harbor."
Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);lets cap the night with a horrible beer! jesus christ who can possibly drink this and claim they like it!?!??!!?? awful!1 tastes of water infused with beer flavoring
Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);473ml can from the LCBO. One asks, ’why’? I would answer, ’I know not...’. Anyways, pours a very pale, excessively effervescent yellow with a large frothy head. Smells like industrialized corn, cooked vegetables, all the usual Lakeport horribleness. The flavour is surprising in that it actually defies expectations of crap and takes it to a whole new level (a lower one). Sour, tart, salty, overly fizzy, generally very unpleasant. Good God. Even for Lakeport drinkers this stuff is pathetic. I don’t even think my sink drain liked it.
Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);[1208-20080318] 473mL can. Corny grain field grass aroma with a hint of light floral hay. Clear, pale orange yellow body with a medium-lasting foamy white head. Watery crushed corn flavour. Watery light body, tinge of astringency. Not horrible for a light but not exactly enjoyable either.
Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Bottle. Light gold. Faint grain and cheap malt aroma and flavour. Over-carbonated palate dominates the experience, leading to a watery and mild bitter finish. Not hideous, and works only as a last resort.
Lakeport Light;Hamilton, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lakeport (Labatt - AB InBev);Bottle. Pours a bubbly pale gold with an average size somewhat-lasting white head -- doesn’t look too bad for a cheap Ontario Pale Lager. Aroma’s corny and sweet along with some grain but there is a hint of hops there, it’s not great but I’ve smelt much worse. Flavour’s mild, there’s not much there, some corn, grain and just a hint of hops -- it’s inoffensive but also quite dull. Not something I’d ever drink, I like flavour in my beer, but If you have to drink some buck-a-beer Light beer then you might as well get this, it’s better then some of the other contenders out there.
Ansells Mild (Cask);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Carlsberg UK;Cask, The Salmon, Leicester. Dark brown, red with a thin head.

Ansells Mild (Cask);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Carlsberg UK;Cask-conditioned at The Wenlock Arms as JW Lees’ Ansell’s Mild 23/0909 - the landlord told me the contract to brew this has been shifted across from Thwaites. As the Thwaites’ brewed rating is here, so is this one. This was dark brown with hints of red and a slight, off-white head. Big malty aroma of cereals, chocolate and dark fruits. A bit thin in the mouth, with more chocolate, a trace of sweet fruit and lightly bitter finish. Drinkable.
Ansells Mild (Cask);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Carlsberg UK;(Cask at Lion Tavern, Liverpool, 19 July 2009) Dark brown colour with frothy, beige head. Roasted, malty nose with chocolate, prunes and raisins. Roasted, malty taste with notes of cola, chocolate and dark fruit. As expected quite thin body, but well balanced and tasty. Good mild. (According to Good Beer Guide -09 it is now supposed to be brewed by Thwaites for Carlsberg UK.)
Ansells Mild (Cask);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Carlsberg UK;On draught at The Wenlock Arms as Thwaites Ansell’s Mild. Very dark brown with an offwhite head. Dark fruit and hints of chocolate. Short finish. Quite interesting.
Ansells Mild (Cask);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Carlsberg UK;Cask conditioned - handpump - Wootton WMC. A ruby coloured mild with an off-white head. A very mild mild with fruits and caramel. A short finish. Sweet yet bizarrely dry at the same time. Ordinary and neckable.
Ansells Mild (Cask);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Carlsberg UK;This is the best mild. Exactly half way between a bitter and stout. Sublime sweetness. Simply superb.
Ansells Mild (Cask);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Mild Ale;Carlsberg UK;Cask (handpump) @ The Royal Oak, CV8, Kenilworth. Clear medium amber color with a small creamy, fair lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate malty, roasted, dust.

Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Brown bitter with a tight fine foam, lightly malty-sweet and faintly syrupy nose, watery and light with a little nutty malt and a touch of leafy hop bitterness. Clean but dull.
Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);"In the 80's it was the best bitter around. There was however a remarkable taste differential that made the difference. This bitter had to be served slightly chilled than conention dictated. I found that the pubs that Indians started to own used to serve this bitter colder than traditional ""white landlords"" pint who believed in bitters served in the typically established rules of room temp or slightly warmer. However we see times have changed and that the immigrants taste particularly the old rules have been thrown out and the traditionalists have failed. In that the taste of Lamb and chicken along with a whole number of other meats that the flavour of the meat has to com through and spices should not be allowed and infact Indians were berrated and riddiculled for employing spices to delicate meats, yet today everyone has to have a curry. This is the case in point with Ansells, if they tried it chilled slightly it would be the best beer in the world."
Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Cask@The Baker’s Arms, Broad Campden (Cotswolds). Bronze beer with a strong white head. The aroma is lightly roasted and toffee, and the flavour is hopped, bitter and mildy toffee. Overall a reasonable beer.
Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Cask conditioned - handpump - Coach And Horses - Wellingborough. A copper coloured beer which, in spite of its move to Leeds still has some sulphuric Burton notes to it. Fairly thin in body but some nice hops come through in the taste. Some bitterness. Old fashioned and approachable.
Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Kenilworth. Anaemic dribble of mealy biscuit, caramel, diluted raisiny fruit. But drinkable.

Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Cask. Live. 3.7% April, 2004: Huntsman & Horn, Near Herne Bay, Kent. Copper orange coloured hoppy bitter with a pleasant sweetness under the earthy bite. An old school bitter, well made. Orange marmalade aroma. [2.9] Keg. Filtered and pasteurised. 3.7% Dec, 2004:Von Alten, Chatham Soft nitro. Dried apple flavour soon followed by cardboard staleness. Leaves a stale bitter taste. The first gulp is acceptable - then the badness settles in and this becomes very nasty indeed. [1.8]
Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Cask at the Red Lion, Shirley. I really enjoyed this one. Tight, creamy head, which remained about half an inch thick throughout. Light golden colour, with a fairly thin mouthfeel. Nicely bitter, balanced with a citrus freshness. Refreshing, crispy, full. I'd say spritzy. Nice.
Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Cask Conditioned at The Plough, Bicester. Amber bitter, a beer from my youth and now it has been reduced to this tasteless, watery rubbish. Originally brewed in Birmingham its now an unloved recipe in a faceless macro brewery.
Ansells Bitter / Best Bitter;Leeds, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leeds (Carlsberg UK);Very standard bitter with that weird combination of wateriness and very unquenching fruity thickness. Not a lot to get excited about, apart from the uncanny taste of condoms (or what I imagine they taste like...).
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;"on tap at the brewery in the middle of nowhere. referred to as both helles and lager but i’ll assume this is the appropriate listing. pale golden with a very light haze that seemed caused by how cold it was served rather than any sediment; the aroma was similar to that of the hefeweizen - yeasty and bready with a trace of vanilla; very simple flavours, a dry plain flour finish, quite lemonadey. not a helles at all and once the refreshment factor wore off it was an effort to get through"
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;I’m not sure this is the right beer. Mine is breaed in Germany. Anyway, it’s too light, probably rice brewed. Not very exciting altogether.
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Golden colour with low carbonation, lack of head. Light tasting with toasty notes. Maybe some Vienna malt. Low bitterness, slightly watery finish. Slightly spicy hop aroma is the only thing this beer has going for it...and it doesn’t go far.
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Thanks to IslandHaole for this. Pours canary with big, white head. Aroma of malt, hopcit, some honey. Tastes malty, with honey and hopcit at the finish. Smooth, with decent complexity.
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;this beer has a sweet aroma, mild bitterness and malt and good medium palate. The only downside is a slight metallic tase.
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;I obviously had a good can compared to other here. Dark Golden color, thin head with a lightly lemon nose that oozes with clean maltiness. Full bodied and hoppy with just a touch of lemon dashing in and out of the tastebuds. Finishing dry and mildly bitter. I thought this was pretty good for the style.
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Looks like any typical lager would. Clear and golden, small head, lively carbonation. As the others have mentioned, nothing noteworthy here. Too bad really, I'd expect a standout beer from this company.
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Nothing to see hear really. Youve probably had about 100 beers that taste almost exactly the same. Its better than most macro lagers but nothing special.
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;Yes, a nice can but not a whole lot more. Something I could drink a lot of. Kind of like a Budweiser. Which isn't necessarily a good thing.
Ginga Kogen Classic;Sawauchi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Ginga Kogen Beer Company;An unremarkable, fizzy, yellow lager that comes in a damn nice golden can. Sort of a Sapporo clone.
Santa Fe Chicken Killer Barley Wine;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Can. Pours clear amber with a small light beige head. Caramel, brown sugar, bit of stone fruit, alcohol. Sweet warming finish.
Santa Fe Chicken Killer Barley Wine;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Fe Brewing Company;It pours chestnut brown with a beige head. It has a medium full body with semi sharp carbonation. It has over ripe fruit, toasted malt, brown sugar, dates and English yeast. Pretty nice. Not rich star, but for the price it's solid

Santa Fe Chicken Killer Barley Wine;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Fe Brewing Company;From Apr 2007 This one pours from 22oz bottle a clear deep amber with a medium sized head of foam. A couple of minutes in to the session, it shrinks to just a few islands in the middle and it has some lacing. The smell has a big nose of caramel malt with some hop notes floating in the background. The taste on first sip is also big on caramel malt but it is not overly sweet. A few more sips in and I'm getting some dark fruit flavours, and some hop bittererness...but not much. I'm also getting some roasted malt, some grain and a bit of an alcohol burn when it goes down but it's not objectionable in my opinion. This is a good BWSA. Bottom line: I picked this one up on my last trip to Ft Collins and it's a good example of the style. I'd buy it again.
Santa Fe Chicken Killer Barley Wine;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Pours deep amber from the bottle. Aroma is apple brandy, caramel, schnapps. Taste is sweet, lightly peppery, full of alcohol, apple vinegar, and the warm presence of alcohol. Body is medium, with average carbonation. Finished me off for the night.
Santa Fe Chicken Killer Barley Wine;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Deep garnet with a stiff khaki head. Appealing spicy earthy/piney hop aroma with toffee and grapey undertones (Vienna malt?). Some waxy and ethanol scents. Big, clean, spicy noble hop flavor and restrained maltiness. Spruce and burnt fig at the back of the tongue. Toasted cornmeal and leather. Not the caramel bomb that most brewers think defines the style. Juicy mouthfeel, not too thick. Carbonation has just enough lift to make the ale smooth and dangerously drinkable. Hop reemerge in the aftertaste, plus some pleasing coffeelike tannins. I love that it doesn’t taste like damn Chinook hops.
Santa Fe Chicken Killer Barley Wine;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Rather alcohol filled and woody taste and it doesn’t really seem to be in harmony.

SeyBrew Lager;Mahé, Seychelles;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Seychelles Breweries (Diageo);Great taste when there‘s nothing else than water. Looks fantastic in your hand with the sea in the back. Comparing it to Köpi, Fiege Pils, Küppers Kölsch or even Galway Hooker it‘s pretty drinkable. Although I must admit, that the other ones would probably also Taste good at the beach with 30 degrees 😋

Avery Salvation;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);From Jan 2007 Poured from 22oz bottle a clear light gold with a very large head of foam that shrank slowly leaving a fine solid layer and there's plenty of lacing. The smell is fruity and yeasty...about right for the style. The taste has some tartness that I noticed immediately with notes of semi sweet malt, hop bitterness, and yeast. A few more sips in and I'm getting some banana and clove but they're pretty sudued. The warming from the alcohol is there but not in abundance so that helps it to be pretty drinkable. Bottom line: This is a pretty good offering of the style from Avery and is at least worth trying.
Avery Salvation;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Avery Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);640mL bottle from Carwyn Cellars, Melbourne. Pours a bright orange body, hazy, firm white head atop. Aroma quite fruity - orange, apricot, peach, toasty/bread crust malt, some spice in there. Big body, smooth texture, carbonation perhaps subdued for style but welcomed, good length. Toasty, cereally malts upfront on the body - leads onto notes of ripe apricot & yellow peach, savoury clovey/woody phenolic spice, finishes dry. Little indication of booze in this one, a nice drink, lacking a bit behind more authentic styles.

Ayinger Lager Hell;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Aying;Clear golden with a frothy head. Strawy, yeasty smell. Very smooth taste, it has the texture of an orange juice with the distinct hoppy and malty taste of a normal beer. Low carbonation.
Ayinger Lager Hell;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Aying;Bottle from Euro summer Santa. Thanks! This is on of better helles I've tried so far. Full malty taste, sweetish, low bitterness, crisp. Tasty I would say
Ayinger Lager Hell;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Aying;500ml bottle brewed in Germany at 4.9%. Crystal clear gold. Nice-sized fluffy head, superb duration. Sweet grassy aroma, minimal corn. Low carbonation, just a tongue-tickle, unusual for the style but welcome. Smooth mouthfeel extends to the flavour - slightly bitter grassy (almost lemony) hops and very mild sweet malt, brown bread-esque when it reveals itself. Splendid hell, simple and refreshing with not a single duff note, none of the corn in the aroma to be found in the flavour. This is not my preferred style of beer, but this particular brew I would not mind drinking any time at all. Ayinger is probably my top pick of German brewers, and may well be the most skilled if my opinion is anything to go by.
Ayinger Lager Hell;Aying, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Aying;On tap at the brewery. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Clean, light, and refreshing. Malty with hints of corn. Average body and mouthfeel.

Hood Canal Dabob Bay IPA;Kingston, Washington, United States;IPA;Hood Canal Brewery;On tap at Hood Canal, pours a hazy dark golden with a small white head. Aroma reveals notes of resinous and bittering hops. Flavour is overmalted, with bitter resinous hops and bready caramel malt. The balance isn’t so good, with too much malt and a weird hop characteristic. Not impressive.

Hood Canal Dabob Bay IPA;Kingston, Washington, United States;IPA;Hood Canal Brewery;October 2012. Bottle. Amber color with a white head. Nice aromas, but a bit bland and out of balance. Somewhat acidic on the finish.
Hood Canal Dabob Bay IPA;Kingston, Washington, United States;IPA;Hood Canal Brewery;Hazy orange, big white head. Aroma reminds me of Brett and Belgian IPA right off the bat with lots of tropical fruit and sweet malt. also kind of a lemonade thing going on. Note sure if this yeast is supposed to be so dominant. It’s not terrible, but it is a little on the sweet side and has too much yeasty gum flavor for my liking. Medium thin body, sweet and mildly bitter finish
Hood Canal Dabob Bay IPA;Kingston, Washington, United States;IPA;Hood Canal Brewery;Bomber from a Fred Meyer on 196th St in Seattle. Pours amber with a foamy 4 finger near white head. Maybe beige. Aroma is rather citric. Med body. Flavor starts a bit cardboard and metallic. There’s a caramel backbone and some citric/grapefruit. It’s nicely bitter. Bitter is the best point.
Hood Canal Dabob Bay IPA;Kingston, Washington, United States;IPA;Hood Canal Brewery;Bottle: &nbsp Orangish side of amber, slight haze, thin white head, spotty lacing, very light carbonation &nbsp Soft hop aroma, some sweet and zesty citrus rind too. &nbsp Fairly sweet on the tongue, hoppy but not biting. &nbsp Seems fairly malty too. &nbsp Does fall a bit flat as far as mouthfeel, lacks carbonation. &nbsp Lingering earthiness and soil. &nbsp Sweet citrusy aftertaste. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate to thin. &nbsp Decent IPA, better than I was expecting but it needs to be more lively. &nbsp Sweeter than most, and less bitter. &nbsp Not bad.
Hood Canal Dabob Bay IPA;Kingston, Washington, United States;IPA;Hood Canal Brewery;"Clear and copper-orange with a nice head -- tightly packed, creamy bubbles and big, bursting bubbles. Creamy carbonation created a nice softness on the tongue. Very fruity and flowery. In the background, I detected an odd, ""synthetic"" perfume quality, which was a bit off putting. I loved the sweet tropical fruit flavors, though. And the mild yet balancing bitterness. RERATE bottle: Overly carbonated; head overflowed with a gentle pour. Sharp and acidic on the tongue. Had some curiously interesting flavors; kind of reminded me of a Belgian ale. Hops were perfumey and floral. Very slight sweetness surfaced, like rock candy and scorched toffee. Overall, odd but decent beer."
Hood Canal Dabob Bay IPA;Kingston, Washington, United States;IPA;Hood Canal Brewery;Received 22-oz bomber via trade with 5000. Pours a semi-hazy orange amber colored brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Aroma of caramel malt, some citrus zest a hint of dill, vanilla and grapefruit. Taste is medium bodied, a touch more malty flavor than hops with a touch of sweet apple. Finish is semi-dry with a hint of citrus and lemon aftertaste.

Great Lakes York Street Bitter;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Slightly brown deep orange without much of a head. Definitely get fruit in both the aroma and flavor overlaying herbal hops and a sweet caramel base. They served this on nitro as part of the tasting flight, delicious creamy mouthfeel.
Great Lakes York Street Bitter;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);I have drunk many moon dog bitters from Great Lakes, and was surprised to find a different ESB on tap at the brewpub during my last visit. The malt on this one tastes less sour than I remember moon dog as (I did not try them side-by-side though), and I think the beer tastes cleaner and fresher as a result. A middle-of-the-road beer that is light in color, and much less hoppy than an IPA or Burning river, but still has relatively strong hops. I think I might prefer if Great Lakes retired moondog and replaced it with this one, but I’d have to try them side-by-side to make a definitive judgment on that matter.
Great Lakes York Street Bitter;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);yellow with huge white head. nose of citrus hops. firm bitterness before nice citrus hop flavor without much malt component in this one. the interesting malt is the creamy head and moutfeel of this beer, likely secondary to a lot of wheat malt. overall an interesting beer that doesn’t really have a style, but is mostly enjoyable
Great Lakes York Street Bitter;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);On-tap at the brewpub. Hazy orange-golden color, with one finger frothy white head. Smell is of citrus and slightly floral. Big biscuity malt flavor, nicely balanced with the beer’s light hop bitterness (even if light, it tastes more bitter than other ESBs I’ve had). Medium body and carbonation.
Great Lakes York Street Bitter;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Tap at the brewery. Deep amber pour with a thin white head. The aroma is quite spicy with a little bit of light orange marmalade character. A little bit earthy and lightly fruity. Soft and spicy with a nice light lingering sweetness. Earthy malts with some light spiciness on the finish. Well-balanced and fairly easy to put back.

Lighter gold, thin white head. Nose is bready malts, some lemony hops, a little mint. Flavor wise there is a really nice hop profile - mint & pine, with caramel. Breadiness comes out in the finish. I’d love to be able to drink this regularly.
Great Lakes York Street Bitter;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pours a clear copper with a creamy head that lingers and clings to the glass.

Lovejoys Hop on Pop;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;"Bit on the watery side with hop dominance that was all off kilter. The Seuss in me loved the name and made me say ""no Pat, NO, don’t sit on THAT!"""
Lovejoys Hop on Pop;Austin, Texas, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lovejoys Tap Room & Brewery;Pale, weak head. I still gave it a 4 on appearance because of the cool tap handle, which had Grandpa Simpson on it. I could hardly detect any aroma, and the flavor consisted of poorly balanced Centennial hops. Blaugh. One of their worse efforts.

Schans Lentebier;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brouwerij De Schans;Hazy copper orange body and off white, firm head. Mild spicy aroma, tutti frutti, sweet white bread and resin hops. Full, sweet taste with a fine bitter hop backup. Rich bodied, bit of alcohol. Marked on the bottle as saison, which I suppose it is. Very nice, fits my taste perfectly. (33cl bottle, cheaply bought at the brewer’s shop)
Schans Lentebier;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brouwerij De Schans;(Bottle 33 cl) Pretty and very simplistic label. Beautiful amber colour, slightly hazy with a dense head. Full, malty body with a perfect balance between sweet and bitter. Pleasantly spiced. Very distinct sediment. 071102
Schans Lentebier;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brouwerij De Schans;Best until jan ’05. Creamy citrusaroma and flavor. Hoppy, in fact an almost oily hoppiness. Long citric hopbitter finish. Very well balaced beer. Excellent!
Schans Lentebier;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brouwerij De Schans;Amber colour, generous head. Nice sweet aroma of malt, caramalt, hop, wallnuts. Harmonious mouth of malt and hop. Dry and bitter finish, with good caramalt and hop. When warmer, it gets sweeter, maltier, and of course also the caramel raises. Not outstanding, but fully enjoyable, to try again.
Schans Lentebier;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brouwerij De Schans;Strange, an American style pale ale from the Netherlands. Big citrusy floral hop aroma. I thought it was perhaps a tad sweet at the start, but the robust bitterness makes up for that. very enyoyable, as per says, very fresh tasting. I great little find.
Schans Lentebier;Uithoorn, Netherlands;Pale Ale - American / APA;Brouwerij De Schans;Red-orange, slightly hazy. Big grapefruit hop aroma. Fruity, dry big hop flavour and really bitter finish. Fresh and tasty. Excellent!
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Bottled. Amber coloured. Aroma of anis. Sweet and spicy flavour with alcoholic notes.
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;(Bottle 30 cl) Beautiful reddish amber with a gigantic head that refuses to settle. Unique spiciness sort of Orval-style. An almost vinous character. Presumably dry, but you sense an underlying sweetness and a discreet bitter finish. Nowhere close to any other Bock I’ve tried. Try to ignore the label art.... 300902
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Authentic. A strong alcoholic taste. Quite fruity and powerful. No head. A diffent beer.
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;An amber beer with a white disappearing head. The aroma is sweet alcoholic with notes of oranges. The flavor is of cloves and peach. You can feel the alcohol. It ends on a dry note. An OK beer.
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Orange-amber, very hazy, flunky even. Yellowish head, fast gone to white rim. Nose with chalk, rich malt, toffee, spicy. Taste: Licoriceflavour. And more licorice, to the exclusion of anything else, but a spicy-tingling tongueside sensation. Gives only licorice-aroma. Whatever sweetness there is, does not conform to licorice-sweetness. Again a citrussy-spicy flavour. Fairly refreshing for all its ABV, but there is some burning sensation that is too pronounced for me. A bit tart, spicy aftertaste, fairly long. This is the second Haerlemsche beer that has this spicy bite I dislike. Tastes like a homebrew-try, and not the best.
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Purchased at De Bier Koning in Amsterdam on 5-25-03. Pours a cloudy blond with a small fluffy white head. The aroma is similar to a wheat beer - cloves, yeast, but with a sugary sweetness in the mix. Very pleasant! Very sweet taste, with the alcohol making it presence known. Perhaps candy sugar, honey, and fruit. Finishes with a little of the alcohol and more of the sweetness. Another interesting Haerlemsche beer. I almost want to say that they are as unique as Fantome, but that would be making too great a comparison. Plus Fantome is pure quality and Haerlemsche has been a little lacking from my experience. All in all, though, this was very good.
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Aroma has honey, apricot, cherry and liquor. Flowery, very perfumed taste, like cologne, with rosebuds, alcohol and orange. Very good lacing, but not a very refined beer.
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;The beer is labelled with a photocopied label, however I bought it and it was definately worth the try. Nice fine bock-taste, nice sweet taste.
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;I thoght this was OK, but it does come across as a bit *amatuerish* as per says. Quite Belgian in taste, even though it was a bock. Some of the ugliest and largest blocks of sediment known to man sit at the bottom, isntantly taking marks off appearance. It was also funny to see the photocopied label, this brewer must have a really small production.
Haerlemsch Lente/Zomer-Bock;Haarlem, Netherlands;Bock - Doppelbock;Haerlemsche Bierbrouwerij;Dark orange very cloudy. Huge flower and apple aroma. Very malty with nice orange flavour which is overpowered by the big floweryness. The label looks like it's been made on a bad copying machine, and the beer tastes like a homebrew. Amateurish but interesting and flavourful, and in the end pretty good.

Reinaert Amber;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;This is a backlog rating from 2007 from a bottle shared by Tmoney99, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time. Words to describe this beer are citrus, pale malts, mild funk, hay.
Reinaert Amber;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle from Willems, best before may 2018. Poors dark amber with thick, dense, pale mocha head. Aroma tasty and of good strength: pear syrup, sourish red currant, fruity caramel, light fruity hops, syrupy but not too sweet.

Overall: This beer is rather intense and balanced, but lacks complexity. The flavour is more intense than the aroma, but both are still lacking. Okay beer, but nothing to write home about."

Reinaert Grand Cru;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;"22-11-2019; bottle; at home (bought at an unknown location, courtesy of a friend). The looks of the beer are quite nice. The beer has a delicious ruby red/reddish amber colour. The beer has some haziness. On top of the beer there is a nice layer of soft slightly greyish-brown foam. Foam retention is low, but a nice creamy drape is left on top of the beer. Not bad. The aroma of the beer is nice, but it is not that special. The malts give some caramel and toffee notes. Hops are herbal. There are some notes of liquorice too. It is nice, but for a Grand Cru? It lacks some interesting features and some depth and layers. I miss something in here. The taste of the beer is fine, but again it misses that specialness. Sweet malts, bitter hops, a sour note there too. It is a bit astringent somehow. Could be more balanced. The palate of the beer is alright. Medium body, a bit sticky texture and a medium carbonation. The finish of the beer is soo-soo. Also a bit astringent. I expected more of the beer. Could be more special."

Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Geproefd op 24-11-2013. Lekkere blonde tripel van brouwerij Van Steenberge in Ertvelde. Zou een etiketbier zijn van Bornem Tripel.
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"The tripel in this series, deep hazy golden blonde with snow white head; yeasty and estery fruity main character on a somewhat caramelly malt base, sweetish, smooth with yeasty, herbally hoppy and somewhat alcoholic finish. Not too interesting and I bet this is an alias of something else, a practice often executed by Van Steenberge. Should do a retasting with Bornem Tripel right next to it..."
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;8/XII/12 - 33cl bottle @ Culinair Bierfestival (Waasmunster) - BB: n/a (2012-1336) Thanks to Kris for sharing today’s beers! Clear yellow beer, big creamy white head, adhesive, pretty stable. Aroma: paint, chemical, citrus, dusty, yeasty, little fruity, white candi sugar. MF: lively carbon, medium body. Taste: citric start, yeasty touch, herbal, bitter, grassy hops. Aftertaste: white candi sugar, bitter touch, alcohol noticeable.
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;33 cl bottle @ home. Appears to have very lively carbonation as thousands of bubbles find there way up to the big, very solid, completely lasting, thick vast white head. Clear tripel-golden color. This is what a tripel should look like imo! Wow! Aroma is a big disappointment after such a good appearance. Malts, slightly musty, hay. Taste isn’t good either. Too bad. Malts, overripe fruits, a wrong kind of tart-bitterness. Weird. Too much carbonation as well. Unfortunate, it started out so well.
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;33cl bottle. decent white head. Hazy blond colour. slight bitter aftertaste
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Golden coloured beer with a good head. Smell is citrus, spices and yeast. A bit to much herbs, alcohol isn’t hidden that good. Hops gets trough also, but it’s not what I expected.
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle in Waasmunster. Pours clear yellow, unequal large bubbly white head. Hay / cereal aroma with grassy hoppiness. A bit metallic. Quite watery, cidery and boring overall.
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;23rd October 2008. Hazy gold beer. Dry and floral. Wheaty dry tones with a little fruit. Very dry finish with some spice. A hint of caraway in there.
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle: A filtered clear golden with a frothy white lacing head. Aroma is fermented fruit. Taste is crisp fruit with nice dry warming finish.
Abdij van Roosenberg;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottled. Hazy golden, rich head. Fruity nose with pickled onion. Swet and fruity with odd flavour of cornichon and pineapple. Juicy with well hidden alcohol, no bitterness. Not the most complex tripel ever but withsome unusual flavours.
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);On tap at the 2009 NABA. I was told that this brewery has come under new ownership and has reopened. Pours a light amber color with a medium white head. The aroma was rich caramel malts, light hops as well. A smooth flavor of caramel malts, light citrus hops as well. Pretty decent and quaffable.
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);On tap @ Dr. Hops. Pours a golden yellow color. Aromas of hops and a touch of malt. Flavor is a creamy malt and a nice citrus hop. Could use more hops though.
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);"The aroma is the best quality of this beer; it is fresh and hoppy. The taste is thin and likewise hoppy, but not well-balanced. Color is on the golden side of amber. No head formation, so no retention, and only fair evidence of lace."
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);"Honey colored with a small head. It has a hop smell and taste with a hint of malt. The bottle has a slightly soapy taste too. Might be a pretty good beer if it was really fresh. With a name like ""Dr. Hops"" though it isn't as hopped as a lot of beers."
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);A bland understated APA, this tastes a bit outdated. Not in age, but style. It just wasn't that impressive for a pale ale. I'm not the tyle to lower the rating based on hop content, but this just straight up didn't have enough hops for a modern APA.
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);I honestly think this is a pale ale in name only, or perhaps I could have purchased an old bottle. I taste hardly any hops at all, tasted lots of honey and malt. Soda like head that is gone almost as soon as you pour it. No complexities at all, and very bland and boring.
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);bought in a Pocatello gas station and consumed on the road. mild hop nose, nice golden color but no head. unchecked rough hop taste throughout, hardly any malt
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);pomeranian orange, with haze and unidentified floating objects, presumably it''s either bottle conditioned or it''s the chunky variety pale ale. dish water head just bums a ride for awhile, it''s thin as hobo trousers. a faint damp root-cellar smell suggests it''s past it''s prime, though it was purchased near the brewery. aside from that, it''s a malty, caramel pale, hop occurring more in a moderate finish than in the aroma. overall kind of a home-brew quality. pretty good, tho fred eckhart probably won''t come begging for the recipe.
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);Huge hops on the nose, good solid head. Nice citrus and malt flavors. Fine beer from Idaho Falls.
Dr Hops Idaho Pale Ale;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Idaho Brewing Co (Dr Hops);GABF 2002: Bright gold, thick head. Nice citric aroma. Creamy caramel and full malt flavor. Nice citric hops round out the malt. Well balanced.
Barley's Devil's Moon Weizenbock;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Barley's Brewing Company;Too flat and suurpy for my taste. It had carbonation bubbles but it still had that flat heavy taste to it. I will give it points for flavor and aroma because there was definitely a lot going on there.
Barley's Devil's Moon Weizenbock;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Barley's Brewing Company;Homebrewing at its finest. Certainly not Barley's best offering but if their annual Homebrew Fest yields beers of this caliber I am going to make it a point to try them. Similar to an APA in color. Light hops aroma. Satisfyingly rich malt flavor. This beer definitely has character.
Barley's Devil's Moon Weizenbock;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Barley's Brewing Company;Not quite up there with Barleys other offerings but still a good beer. Very malty and sweet. Very little hop presence.
Barley's Devil's Moon Weizenbock;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Barley's Brewing Company;This beer was the winner of last year's home brewmaster contest that they held and is currently on tap. It is a nice golden color with a decent white head which left some lace. Had some aroma of hops and slight aroma of malt. The taste was definately of hops, but not overpowering. The homebrewer, who's batch was number 666 hence the name, did a good job.

Batemans Jewel in the Crown;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;Cask Handpump at Wetherspoons, Manchester 30/05/2002 Golden colour. Poured lively. Hoppy and slightly rich on the palate. Lasting malt finish.
Batemans Jewel in the Crown;Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Batemans;A jubilee special. Quite fruity for a bitter. There is an unusual cider-like acidicy to this beer. Strange but recommended. One for even the staunchest republican!
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Offwhite small head, dark golden colour. Strong dominating hoppy flavour, malts. Hoppy, dull taste.
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);amber colour, sweet-bitter aroma, soft palate, some carbonation. Light bitter finish. Easy drinker
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);"(Bottle 25 cl) Beautiful amber colour, although the label rather confusingly claims that this beer is ""light as a pilsener"". I mean, whats the point in producing an amber if you’d rather it looked like a pils? Anyways, De Smedt didn’t succeed - this is an archetypical ""Amber"" or ""Speciale"" in the same vein as De Koninck or Palm. Small, creamy head. Some caramel sweetness balanced by some hoppiness. High carbonation. 120305 and 111199"
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Amber beer with offwhite head. Te armoa is a bit metalic. Taste is thin and watery with some sweetness.
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Bottle. (Label says Cabbac Speciale Amber). Sourish, bitter hop aroma. Dark amber colour. Caramel, spice hints. Quite boring, though. Aftertaste is yeasty and a bit like cheap lager.
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);An amber beer with a huge orange head. The aroma is sweet spicy while the flavor is sweet with primary notes of caramel and lesser notes of spices, while the body is thin.
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Bottle. Golden colour with a small white head. Sweet light barnyard aroma and a light sour taste. Medium body and a light sour finish.
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Bottle - in a side-by-side tasting with Op-Ale (wiich I heard of as being the same beer as this one Clear, amber body. Moslty lasting lightly brown head. Fair lace. Nose of yeats (light - dough) and hops (moderately - flowers) Lightly bitter, lightly sweet initial flavour. Lightly bitter finish. Slightly watery. Result of the side-by-side: the beers aren’t exactly the same. They are very similar, but the GB beer is a little bit more watery.
GB Special Amber (De Smedt);Opwijk, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Affligem / De Smedt (Heineken);Typical bulk brew for Belgian supermarket chain GB. Amber copper clear with medium small white head. Faint hops, malt, acrylic plastic and sour milk aromas. Weak non-descript watery body. Bland mild bitter and some malt flavours with that plastic thing coming through at the end again. Fortunately they come in 250 cc bottles and I only bought one.
Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a dark brown color with a finger’s worth of white to off white foamy head that dissipated at a moderate pace. Subtle sliding lace. The aroma had some toast, nutty sweetness and crisp roastiness, some milk chocolate and then caramel/toffee malts. The flavor blended fairly well between the nuts and caramel/toffee malts. Chocolate lays further back in this department. Pillowy smooth sweet nuts and caramel/toffee malts in the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. ABV felt good as projected. Overall, good English styled brown ale worthy of having again.
Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;APPEARANCE - perfect brown color. Nice light brown head with real persistence. NOSE - excellent maltiness. FLAVOR - excellent malty flavor with nice balanced. NOTES - excellent spot on brown ale.

Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;Got a 12 oz single from Oliver’s in Albany. A deep ruby brew with thin tan head. Good carbonation. Nice deep nutty aromas. Flavor is deep and malty. Lots of dark malts, some nuts. Almost porter-like with the roastiess. Chocolate and coffee notes. Well balanced. Slight fruitiness on the backside. Smooth and very quaffable, like a good brown should be.
Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. Smells like roasted nuts with a little bit of chocolate. Taste is mild, slight nutty flavor. Not too shabby. EBC has better brews though, and there are better brown ales as well, but this is worth a try.
Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;"Bottle from Half Time. Pours dark amber with a decent foamy beige head. Roast caramel and ""nutty"" aromas. Med body. Flavor is that roast caramel with dirt typical of a brown ale. There’s some definite bitter behind the malt. So it’s pretty balanced and arguably more bitter than malty. Pretty clean for a brown."
Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;On tap at Mr. Goodbar’s. Big brown sweetness with some spice. Not necessary but I just like to have a beer here. Reddish brown colour. Medium mouthfeel, carbonation right there. Not greatly drinkable.
Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;Bottle into mug (sampled 6/20/10). Poured a clear medium brown with a one finger short lasting head. Aroma pulled in some nice nutty notes with a hint of the hops and a little sugar in there too -- very interesting. Very smooth in the mouth and while the malt sweetness was present it wasn’t as overpowering as I thought it would be and the hops added the right amount of bite at the finish to keep this refreshing. Overall a pretty good one!
Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;"12 ounce bottle. Pours a clear light brown color with a medium white head. The aroma is a sweet nutty malt and fruity hop. The flavor is a nice very hoppy brown ale; sweet caramel and toasted malts, pine and bitter hops, almost like a Brown IPA (just kidding), dry and malty. Very nice. An easygoing brew."
Ellicottville Nut Brown;Ellicottville, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Ellicottville Brewing;Ellicottville Nut Brown is a very clear copper ale with a foamy, waxy, bubbly khaki head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a toasty, nutty aroma with notes of grass and flowers. It’s pretty light bodied and a little sharp. The finish is chewy. It has a light but well balanced taste, not sweet or dry. It’s toasty and nutty, just like the aroma. The finish is a little bitter with herbs and grass. The aftertaste is nutty. This is very drinkable. This would be an acceptable session ale.

Frog Beer Ginger Twist;Paris, France;Flavored - Other;FrogBeer;Robe blond doré, un peu foncée, mais certainement pas ambrée ! Mousse faible et éphémère, carbo faible. Nez un peu pâtissier, malté.

South Shore Rhoades Scholar Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;Draft. A slightly nutty chocolatey stout nice and creamy. Not too strong reallypleasant and nice.
South Shore Rhoades Scholar Stout;Ashland, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;South Shore Brewery;04-May-14 (12-oz bottle: Obtained in trade with hopdog, thanks Steve!) This Stout pours a black body and half an inch of tan head that settles to a ring. The nose is sweet and unexpectedly fruity, having a dried cherry character, but also lots of chocolate, so it smells like chocolate-covered cherries, but also coconut like an Almond Joy. For added complexity, there’s also a nice savory character, some cigar box, even a little grilled meat. On the palate, too, the sweet-and-sour cherry aspect jumps out, maintaining a prominent front from entry to finish. More typical flavors of dark chocolate, tobacco, dark toast, grilled meat, coconut, and brown sugar provide savory complexity and balance. Medium sweet is countered by mild roasty bitterness. The beer is full bodied and has a rich, creamy, round mouthfeel, and carbonation is light-medium. Overall, with the cherry imagery, it’s a little different from what I was expecting, but in a good way. Really enjoyable.

Queens Wharf Boltons Ginger Beer;Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia;Flavored - Other;Queens Wharf Brewery;Quite cloudy with a big frothy head, which looks great initially but doesn't really last. Aroma is nice and gingery and lemony like a soft drink ginger beer (yum). It tastes OK but it probably lacking in ginger bite and is definitely too sweet.

Yours, Betty.

You would almost swear you were drinking a soft drink (the head fades aswell). Nice to see someone having a go at this style though.

Nose?) on the notes that I can’t describe; dry with limited bitterness and a mostly pleasant malty, biscuit, fruity finish. This blond is more eclectic than explosive."

Looks pretty trashy to me. Pours a golden colour with a decent head that leaves good lacing. The carbonation is made of medium size bubbles and seems natural (for a lager). Well for swill, this one has malt to its nose. The mouth is smooth with slight sweet malt. Better then the Lucky Lager I had last night.

The beer poured a translucent medium gold with a generous white bubbly head which quickly disappeared. The aroma was grainy malt and metal. The mouthfeel was weak bodied and medium carbonated. The flavour was stale grainy malt, and acidic bitterness.
Yankee Jim Genuine Draft;Belgrade, Montana, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Hole Brewing Company;4th sample from the crap-pak at the annual K-W swillfest. No off tastes per se - just bland, fizzy thin and with sharp dextrin extract tastes and rice and corn aromas - like wet cardboard. Good to know crappy adjunct swill beer is not native to Canada’s macro brewers,. This is pure swail from the home of liberty.

Abita Blueberry Blues;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Abita Brewing Company;Very simmilar to the Abita Purple Haze in that it is a wheat beer with added rasberry flavors. They only make one batch a year for the LA blueberry festival and it is available only there or at the Abita Brew Pub. Beer is tart and sweet and even seems to have a sting to it (very carbonated). Simmilar textures to Purple Haze, but not nearly as good. Some people, however, that do not like purple haze tend to like this brew. Go figure.

Oliver Best Bitter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oliver Brewing Co.;"On cask at Bertha's in the Fell's Point district, Baltimore, MD, where it is called Bertha's Best Bitter. The beer was served at a warm room temperature, rather than the ""cellar temperature"" stated on Bertha's menu."" Or perhaps, Bertha's cellar is kept rather warm. Clear, dark amber-orange win an off-white head and excellent lacing. Aroma of fresh-baked bread. Taste of liquid brown bread and mild orange. Fairly sweet with only a hint of hops. Medium body and low carbonization. [This is the same as Bertha's Best Bitter, which is served at Bertha's in Fell's Point, Baltimore, MD.

Oliver Best Bitter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oliver Brewing Co.;An on the money best bitter, served on cask and the bedrock of a session with mates. Pours a wonderful amber colour with an inch or so of head, the aroma is seville oranges, some spiciness and the grasiness of Fuggles. Tastewise, sweet pale malt with some judicious caramel malt and a firm though unobtrusive hop bite that lingered and left you wanting more, medium bodied and a superb representation of one of the more difficult styles to brew well.
Oliver Best Bitter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oliver Brewing Co.;Golden amber with a creamy white head. Sweet, malty aroma with a whiff of dusty hop.

Oliver Best Bitter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oliver Brewing Co.;Reviewed from notes. On cask at Pratt Street. Pours a moderate orange brown with a good white head and some nice lacing. Quite a bit of lace is there, but can’t bump to a 4.5 given that it doesn’t overpower and it is cask.

Oliver ESB;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oliver Brewing Co.;"6% ABV. Extra Special Bitter. Hand pumped out of the cask. Tapped a luscious dark nut brown at about 25ºSRM. Nose is full of nice vanilla, cream and oatmeal type flavors. All this came through so cleanly even though I had just got into town in the middle of some heavy pollen and the hayfever was kicking in. The palate is lusciously splendid, with full bodied deeply roasted malts. You can tell when you get that first shot of umami on the palate followed by a nice slow slide to ume. Light carbonation giving it a very hefty mouthfeel. Velvety smooth and a nicely balanced bitter finish. Honors the name ""extra special"". A creamy, rich and very satisfying pint. Likely one the finest. Gets my very special recommendation to try first if available on cask at the Pratt Street Ale House. Goes on Favorites List."

Oliver ESB;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Oliver Brewing Co.;RATING UPDATE: Tried cask version again, this time at Mahaffey?s. Better overall but still not my cup o? tea. A bit too sweet on the tongue for my tastes. ORIGINAL RATING COMMENTS: I’m HOPING that I just got a stinky pour when I got the cask version last night at Wharf Rat, and that perhaps there was something a bit funky as a result of nobody else imbibing of it... the place was DEAD, while just around the corner other joints were hopping! I tend to really like bitters, see that this ale is usually rated very well, and hope it was just an odd, rare miss. Anyway, it started well enough-- smelled nice and fruity-hoppy, and attractive coloring of amber-copper. Unfortunately it was downhill from there, as the taste ranged from soapy to sweet to sour, the body seemed off, and it became downright unpleasant to the point that I only drank about half before giving up (and that?s not at all a typical behavior for me!). I?ll look for it again elsewhere in the future and pray it was just a case of an off firkin/pour.

When it tapped out, I was expecting a lambic. Wheat beer with nice solid wheat, bread and flour-like flavors. It had an light sour palate. No aroma hops expected or delivered. Bitter hops with a herbaceous bitter finish. No much in the way of cherry flavor, they are not kidding when they say it is ""kissed"" with cherry flavor. I suppose the sour could be interpreted to be the sour of fresh cherries. Pleasant enough seasonal."

Oliver Vanilla Ice;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Oliver Brewing Co.;"This is the worst beer I’ve ever had. Expected a ""light summery brew with some sweet vanilla flavor"" (as quoted by the bartender). What I got was an aroma-less, flat, bland beer. It tasted like someone’s first crack at a homebrew that would make them think, ""OK, it won’t kill anyone, but surely I can do better."" It wasn’t helped by the hideously dirty draft lines, but since their beer is brewed on-site, I fault them completely. I would avoid self-brews at The Wharf Rat at all costs."

Oliver Vanilla Ice;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Oliver Brewing Co.;A light yellow beer with a thin off-white head.

Oliver Vanilla Ice;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Oliver Brewing Co.;Draft... RBSG2006... Barely yellow ale with a small, creamy, white head. Not much going on in the aroma other than a pleasant insinuation of vanilla. Much the same flavor-wise... seltzer water with a splash of vanilla. Short, crisp, clean finish. Refreshing, but so is club soda. Club soda is far less expensive... even a small bottle of vanilla extract is inexpensive and goes a long way.
Oliver Vanilla Ice;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Other;Oliver Brewing Co.;Ice Ice baby. Very light colored. Said it was a wheat beer and ale, though it looks lighter than any lager.

McKenzie Black Lab Stout;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;McKenzie Brew House;Brown black pour with tan head and lace. Aroma of toasted malt and light chocolate.

McKenzie Trappist Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;McKenzie Brew House;another bottle found n the basement. I’m pretty sure it’s a 2003. aroma is just about all brettt, very nice. the beer was not cloudy and clear. flavor, no oxidation, very hoppy still and nice brett flavors, horseblanket, and musty, but still well balanced by hops. medium to full bodied, just an amazing beer that I wish I had bought more of. held up very well. I’d put it in the same ballpark as orval. very nice.
McKenzie Trappist Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;McKenzie Brew House;Thanks to Slander for sharing this one at heavyweight open house. 750 ml bottle- label fell off, but labelled on the cap. This was a bottle from 03, so I think the brett characteristics may have increased over time. Pours a clear light gold with a nice fluffy lasting head. Aroma is out of control with brett, in a good way. A crapload of barnyard aromas- hay, horseblanket, musty cobweb like, and even a bit of lemony citrus to it as well. Flavors are loaded with horseblanket, leather, nice citrusy notes, light bready malts, and a dry slightly acidic and bitter finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth despite a relatively high carbonation. Excellent beer- similar, but better than many other beers that use brett to try to replicate orval.
McKenzie Trappist Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;McKenzie Brew House;Shared 750ml bottle. Not a bad beer. Was expecting something a little more. Tasted what it should be.
McKenzie Trappist Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;McKenzie Brew House;Pours a clean, medium golden color with a giant foamy head that’s gonna be here a while.

McKenzie Trappist Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;McKenzie Brew House;750ml bottle shared with scubatrip: Slightly cloudy light orange-amber that is a pale straw golden yellow when held to the light. Medium white head that lasts for the first few sips and then dies. The aroma has some barnyard to it, and at first I’m worried that maybe I have a bad bottle. Checking other ratings here it seems like it’s supposed to have this light farmhouse quality to it. There are also hints of lemon zest, spicy cloves, yeast, wood, and wet leather. The taste has some barnyard & leather flavors at first, and opens up to show apple, tart orange rind, sweet light malts, biscuit, and a hint of peppery alcohol if held in the mouth. Finishes dry with grassy/spicy hops, sweet light malts, and funky yeast. Tastes a bit more like a farmhouse ale, as BobSandage points out that what I was expecting.
McKenzie Trappist Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;McKenzie Brew House;Pours a murky medium yellow with lots of head. Aroma of sweat socks. Yeasty and medicinal in flavor. If the beer was classified as a farmhouse ale, I could see the justification in the high ratings this beer achieves. As a Belgian Pale Ale, I don’t think it is that good of an example of style.
McKenzie Trappist Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;McKenzie Brew House;Poured a dark gold with a fluffy off white head. Aroma was yeasty with some clove/spices and barnyard funk as it warms. Flavor starts a little sweet and tart with a dry light bitter finish.
McKenzie Trappist Pale Ale;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;McKenzie Brew House;Pours a clear deep golden with a huge, puffy and well-lacing white head. Has a very interesting, complex, earthy barnyard aroma. Body starts lightly creamy, dry, earthy and malty with some mild leathery sweetness. Nice complexity and balanced lead to great authenticity. With a touch more hops, this would be a very close duplicate to Orval. Thanks go out to slob for the trade!

Pumphouse Wildfire Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;This beer was a little to mild for me as far as the wheat beers are concerned i would like a little more from that type
Pumphouse Wildfire Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;I don’t normally like wheat beers, but this one wasn’t too bad. It did not have that spicy flavor/aftertaste that so many wheats have. Very refreshing on a hot day, but I wouldn’t drink more than one.
Pumphouse Wildfire Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;From the Jug at the Pumphouse Brewery & Restaurant, Longmont 08/10/2008 Hoppy aroma.

Pumphouse Igniter Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;When compared to other Colorado IPA’s this one holds its own. It has a nice hop-to-malt balance, a crisp mouthfeel and a good finish.
Pumphouse Igniter Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;From the Jug at the Pumphouse Brewery & Restaurant, Longmont 08/10/2008 Hoppy aroma.

Pumphouse Igniter Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draft at the brewery. Dark amber in color and flavors of caramel malts with light spice and a very light hop profile make this a very average pale ale. Pretty plain, non-descript even and certainly nothing to get too excited about especially on a beer trip through Colorado.
Pumphouse Igniter Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Crushed with Jakebra at the brewpub. Light hops and caramel malt on the nose. Great bitter hoppy flavor and finish kicks ass. Excellent pale ale.
Pumphouse Igniter Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;I’d say the American beer community has moved beyond this hoppy pale ale with the advent of extreme brewing. But this is a nice beer and should be enjoyed for the balance of hop and malt, for the contrast of sweet malt and bitter hop, achieved without one overpowering the other. It’s a nice beer.
Pumphouse Igniter Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Tap @ Pumphouse: Poured a lightly hazed dark copper color with a small off-white head.

Pumphouse Red Alert Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draught. Sweet caramel and cherry aroma. Dark ruby with a thin swirly head and slow but active carbonation. Good malt depth but a touch too sweet. Caramel with chocolate and nutty notes. Palate is thin, but more than that particularly watery, as in diluting of the flavor of the beer.
Pumphouse Red Alert Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Tap at the brewpub - a very malty amber ale, so much so that it is hard to even notice those hops trying to break through - very sweet, nutty, with touches of nutmeg and other spices (this makes things a little more interesting) - the boiled vegetable character I noticed in their IPA is even more noticeable here, and it really detracts from my enjoyment of the beer.
Pumphouse Red Alert Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;From the Jug at the Pumphouse Brewery & Restaurant, Longmont 08/10/2008 Malt aroma. Bronze golden coloured and malty with a crisp dry and slightly bitter finish.
Pumphouse Red Alert Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Crushed with Jakebra at the brewpub. Sweet malt nose. Lots of sweetness. Definite initial hop bitterness that mellows into a very pleasant malt sweetness. One of the most appealing ambers I’ve ever had.
Pumphouse Red Alert Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Tap @ Pumphouse: Poured a clear red copper color with a thin off-white head. The aroma was malty with some sweetness. Toasty caramel notes. The malty flavor had a little roast to it. Hints of chocolate and citrus. Semi-dry and bitter finish. Medium body.
Pumphouse Porter;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Porter;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;"Sadly, a high carbonation plus low malt levels creates a thin body in this one. Some astringent bitterness detected from the carbonation. Pleasant chocolate and coffee notes though. Unfortunately, hard to detect behind the fizz and rather harsh bitterness (not a ""hoppy"" bitterness, but rather an ""astringent"" bitterness). Maybe it was a bad batch?"
Pumphouse Porter;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Porter;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draught. Black (possibly opaque, but I forgot my flashlight). Aroma is moderately malty (strong coffee, roasted nuts, dark chocolate). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly acidic, moderately bitter, hint of husk/vegetable. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. More like a stout than a porter to me, but overall very good...the aroma is more genuinely coffee-like instead of the biting roasted grain note of most American stouts, and the flavor is nicely balanced except for a bit of husky aftertaste. The recipe reportedly changes somewhat with each batch.
Pumphouse Cherry Bomb Saison;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;(Trinity Saison Festival 4/17/10). Light rose/blush color. Medium white head.

Pumphouse Cherry Bomb Saison;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;"Avery Sour Ale Fest. I just wrote down ""nope"" for my notes on this one. Can only assume that there was neither a cherry nor a bomb in this brew. Compared to other Pumphouse fruity beers I’ve had, I wouldn’t be surprised if the fruit was either flat and stale or basically non-existent."
Pumphouse Cherry Bomb Saison;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Boulder Sourfest ’10 - promising nose, with a nice cherry character, mild spiciness and subtle yeast phenols - the taste, however, was waxy, artificial, like poorly made cherry syrup - it kind of tasted like the inside of a Yankee Candle shop - yick.

Pumphouse Cherry Bomb Saison;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;"Very promising nose. Upon the first sip, it actually delivered. Near equal amounts of yeasty and alcoholic flavors. Malts were mild, yet noticeable. Cherry notes were subtle in the aroma and flavor departments, thankfully. Actually, I thought it had the perfect amount of cherry infusion; not too much, but just enough. It provided some subtle fruity flavors and a nice tartness in the finish. Interesting sensation of hotness on the tongue. Very well-made and tasty."

Abdij van Roosenberg Blond;Ertvelde, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Abbey blond but ’fake’, i.e. brewed not for an actual abbey, but for Bierland in Hamme, if my memory doesn’t fail me.

EB Premium;Elbląg, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Browar w Elblagu (Grupa Żywiec - Heineken);500ml can from the shop in Wroclaw. It's back and it's good. Didn't pour, but definitely clear. Strong complex malty aromas driven by honey and soft caramel with a healthy dose of floral and herbal hops.

Good Bastards Dark Ale;Westport, New Zealand;Brown Ale;West Coast Brewing;Bottle - my first foray into Good Bastards beers. A good dark brown colour. Just a little sweet malt on the nose, with a hint of chocolate. A dryish palate with a very grainy malt flavour. The mouthfeel is overall thin and watery. Made to be unoffensive, and meets the mark. Would be popular in Cossie Clubs I’m sure. Does what it says on the label - and there’s nothing wrong with that.
Good Bastards Dark Ale;Westport, New Zealand;Brown Ale;West Coast Brewing;330mL bottle. Pours red/brown, thin tan head. A sweet nose, smooth smelling with roasty malt. Flavour comes mainly from roast malt, with smooth cocoa and a hint of bitterness. The let down is a very thin, watery body. Very drinkable, very mild flavour.
Good Bastards Dark Ale;Westport, New Zealand;Brown Ale;West Coast Brewing;330ml bottle. Rich black in colour with a velvety creamy slightly tan head. Burnt toffee and chocalte aroma and feels smooth and silky in the mouth. Taste of burnt malt.
Good Bastards Dark Ale;Westport, New Zealand;Brown Ale;West Coast Brewing;Roasted malt nose, milk chocolate and some coffee. A hint of hop in there too. Rather watery mouthfeel that doesn’t support the aroma. A bit of an off flavour of nuts... Reminds me of a simple, watery lager with burnt malt added.
Good Bastards Dark Ale;Westport, New Zealand;Brown Ale;West Coast Brewing;Shared this one with my wife over lamb burgers at Tuatara Backpackers. There are equal touches of chocolate and crystal malt, lending a nice flavour without any complexity. But the label makes this clear: this beer is NOT about complexity and all about having a good session. Fair enough. Cheesy label though.
Good Bastards Dark Ale;Westport, New Zealand;Brown Ale;West Coast Brewing;Dry molasses, roasty aroma. Overly chummy label. I’m sure someone was laughing their arse off while designing the label, but it’s just not funny. Medium dark brown and clear. Dry coffee porter. Slightly tangy and mulchy. Medium light body. Light metal, light roast soy in the finish. A bit watery. Fair enough session beer.
Good Bastards Dark Ale;Westport, New Zealand;Brown Ale;West Coast Brewing;Black in colour, pours with big head. strong malty aroma. Sweet cappicinao tatse, needs more bitterness.
Good Bastards Dark Ale;Westport, New Zealand;Brown Ale;West Coast Brewing;Butterscotchy, caramelly, slightly raosty nose. Sweet, mossy, hints of roastyness on the palate, dries out a touch towards the finish, a touch better than my first sample, a cross between, Newcastle Brown and tooheys Old or something, not a favourite style, easy to drink, but not overly interesting. This time, my bottle appeared to be quite old, it had avery rusty cap, it was better than the first bottle i had of it.

Leaves a foamy lacing on the glass. Pale aroma of malts, cereals, mild herbs and a hint of citrus. Taste is quite light too: pale malts, crispy hops, some cereal/biscuit and citric notes. Delicate carbonation, light to medium body, tender hoppy finish. Pleasant easy drink to go with grill food on a hot summer’s day, but doesn’t stand out in any way. Extra points for being gluten free.

Stadin Dubbel;Helsinki, Finland;Dubbel;Stadin Panimo;Draught (HBF2001) Dark, small keggy head. Sweet bready yeasty aroma, fruit esters, a little sickly. Palate too a bit slick. Good roast, and gently hop components, but not subtle enough for me, not to the Belgian style. Rating rediscovered while packing for a move in 2010.
Stadin Dubbel;Helsinki, Finland;Dubbel;Stadin Panimo;Pours beutifully cloudy reddish brown with a firm brown/beige head. Nice strong fruity, nutty, spicy aroma. It is balanced dryish and is firmly malty. Roasty and earthy with hints of oranges. Bitterish finish. Very complex and superbly balanced. This is an outstanding ale!
Stadin Trippel;Helsinki, Finland;Tripel;Stadin Panimo;Draught @ Villi Wäinö. Hazy amber, thin white head. Light soury nose, citrus, yeast, quite spicy. Flavor has yeast, dough, citrus, spices, hops. Interesting tripel-like brew with some twists. -- rated with beerbasher/winphone
Stadin Trippel;Helsinki, Finland;Tripel;Stadin Panimo;Tap@blackdoor. Yellow, cloudy. Fruity malts on nose. Really fruity- apples, pear, melon, like a fruit cider really. Good soft smooth body, almost creamy, real nice. Dry, bitter, but nicely soft though. Apple seeds&zest flavour-wise, pale malts, some hay. There’s probably some yeasty tripel esters there, but the fruityness is just so overwhealming right now. I guess this is a bit too young. Doesn’t taste like a triple, more like a fruit beer/cider. I hope I’ll find it after a month or so...
Stadin Trippel;Helsinki, Finland;Tripel;Stadin Panimo;Draught (HBF2001) Dry hoppy aroma, closer to the belgian style than the dubbel was. Peppery hoppy bite, but also plenty of sweet malts and yeastiness. My last Stadin of the evening, and a good one to end on. Rating rediscovered while packing for a move in 2010. Yes, I was an idiot - I should have stayed for the Stadin Festari Sahti, and Barley Wine. Rerate: 250ml bottle - From Timo Konttinen’s personal stash - Brewed 2002, drunk 2015. (7:3:8:3:15=3.6) Lovely sweet malty mammi aroma, lots of raisins, plenty of oxidisation too. Pours a flat dark orange, with almost no head. Wow - what a gorgeous taste. Everything from the aroma is improved - beautifully rich malts, some mjod-like aspects, lovely sherry for the raisins. Palate is a bit flat, but it is a very old beer. Finish is honeylike malts, and a lovely dry resiny hop finish. Overall - this is fantastic, and has survived the ageing very well. The whole thing is so light, there’s no sign of 8.7+% at all. Respect, StaPa, the first Finnish micro brewery I ever heard of, and the one I fell in love with immediately afterwards.
Stadin Trippel;Helsinki, Finland;Tripel;Stadin Panimo;Golden colour, slightly hazy, firm white head. Distinct aroma of banana and white wine(!). Sweet and full bodied, fruity, pineapple flavour. Honeyish finish.
Stadin Barley Wine 2001;Helsinki, Finland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadin Panimo;250ml bottle (thanks FatPhil and congratulations on 10k!). Slightly hazy dark amber color. No head. Dried apricots, sweet, honey, fruity notes in aroma. Dried fruits, apricots mainly, woody, bit of straw, caramel, sweet in taste. Woody bitterness. Sweet, caramel in aftertaste. Feels thin (fuller as it warms up), but it’s 10%!? Nice one!
Stadin Barley Wine 2001;Helsinki, Finland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadin Panimo;250ml bottle - from Timo Konttinen’s personal stash - thanks! Quite spicy aroma, apricot, some apple from Anna, almost a little watery, touch of mint later. Quite a light palate, no sticky sweetness at al, carbonation very low. Taste is mostly of rich roasty bread, some mintiness in the retronasals too. Very pleasant bitterness in the finish, dry and noble. Later some dark treacle. Palate remarkably light, absolutely no sign of 10% at all, almost watery. Gentle woodiness. Very easy sipper. Fills out a little as you go down the bottle, but never becomes dirty. Finish even has a little bit of a coffee later, quite unexpected, but nice. Prefered this to the Lee’s Harvest - and that’s saying something.
Stadin Barley Wine 2001;Helsinki, Finland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadin Panimo;(BBE 4/03) Orange colored, vanishing yellow head. Strong alcohol in barley winish aroma, fruits, mild developed cardboard and raisins there also. Medium to full bodied. Flavor is sweet with nuts, balanced and still very warming alcohol, nice woody tones and toffee. Excellent flavor. Aftertaste is vinous with lasting fruits also. Nice treat!
Stadin Barley Wine 2001;Helsinki, Finland;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Stadin Panimo;Orange coloured, cloudy, no head. Pours thick. Restrained aromatic hop aroma. Fruity, very malty, hints of pineapple. Bitter finish with hop aroma all the way through. This excellent barley wine is dominated by the chewy malt.
Stadin Old Porter;Helsinki, Finland;Porter;Stadin Panimo;(Tapped) Deep red, almost black color, small head. Mild, sweetish, fruity aroma. Quite sweet, a bit thin and alcoholic palate. Bittersweet aftertaste. Seems like someone added water to this. Needs more body.

It pours a lactic murky yellow beer with a fizzy white head. The nose is reminiscent of pataks chilli & lime pickle, arabic gum, candy sugar, lemon peel and vinegar- very distinct. Extremely sweet taste. Metallic, sulphury, acidic and reminiscent of a mixture between maple syrup, lemonade and and brown sugar. This beer gets cloying after a few sips. Disgusting sticky metallic finish which is reminiscent of maple syrup and iron tablets. The aroma was interesting and not unpleasant. Awful taste. Thanks Bov!

Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;355ml bottle. Had this side by side with a german doppelbock and this left me confused. Its like chocolate balsamic syrup.
Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;28-Jul-10 (12-oz bottle) Cellared a few years now, this beer pours hazy, dark-amber with nearly an inch of creamy, light-tan head. The beer smells very sweet and fruity, with raisins and figs coming out much more than dark malts. The sweet, dark fruitiness continues on the palate, offering honey, prunes, figs, molasses, brown sugar, milk chocolate, and dark, slightly smoky malts, but the overall sweetness is a bit excessive. Full bodied in weight and moderately carbonated, it’s rich and smooth on the palate. Sure, it’s certainly a bit older than what is ideal for the style, and there’s some oxidation present, but it’s still quite enjoyable.
Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Draft at Old Fashioned. Thick, opaque brown. Thin, oily head. Rich and chocolaty. Very thick and rich body with some dark fruit tones as well. Doesn’t really nail the style. Lots of roasty character. Fairly unique or just oddly executed.
Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pours a hazy mahogany color, with a sudsy lace - quite a nutty aroma, with some dough, faint diacetyl, fig, raisin - smooth, creamy, medium-bodied - quite nutty, with notes of brown sugar, a lot of raisin, toffee, caramel - finishes with loads of chocolate and a spicy/peppery character, which is a nice twist - aside from the mild diacetyl in the nose, this is a pretty solid brew - quite underrated - maybe they just have poor quality control.
Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pour was dark copper with a roasted caramel and sweet malt aroma. Dark fruit character came out in the flavor with more sweet malt. Well blended brew.
Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Bottle. Poured a clear orange brown color with a khaki head. Smelled of glazed donut, hay, and nonspecific spices. Medium bodied with low-ish carbonation and a bit of sweetness. tasted of toffee, ice tea, and a bit of grassy hop. Fresh cereal grain aftertaste. So so.
Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Pours reddish brown with large head. Earthy aroma with some nuttiness. Flavor is fruity yet bland and sour.
Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Not sure who traded me this one as I just found it when I was cleaning up some old boxes (so who knows how long its been in there). Poured a medium and cloudy reddish / brownish color with a huge sized off white head. Aromas of dirt / earthy, roasted nuts, and some card board. Tastes of dark fruits (raisins with some plums and cherries), caramel, and nuts. A little off and a little sour finish that I actually kind of liked.
Valkyrie Invader Doppelbock;Dallas, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Valkyrie Brewing Company;Aroma is slightly vinegary and sweet. Dark brown body with a quickly diminishing head. Flavor is light roasted malt, some chocolate, slight dirt/earthen flavor. Palate is weak and lacks carbonation. This bottle may be past prime. Flavor was pretty good nonetheless.

Ellezelloise Saisis;Ellezelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des Légendes);Bottle. Very cloudy orangey gold in colour. Fruity spicy hoppy wheat beer. Fruity (grapefruit-citrus). Spicy (coriander & cloves). Yeasty (lots of sediment). Hoppy. Quite a tart bitter citrus hoppy edge. A rare thing - a hoppy wheat beer. A cross between a Saison and a Witbier. Unusual. Nice! (2008)
Ellezelloise Saisis;Ellezelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des Légendes);"A somewhat different wheat beer, as there are several in Wallonia. Yellowish white, regular, sticky but not very stable head, colour of ’old gold’, clear instead of the expected mistiness which typifies a standard witbier. Light fruity aroma, grapefruit, green apple, pine resin, grains, honey, grassy and somewhat peppery hops. Grainy taste with a brief, honeyish sweetness in the onset, drying up from the middle onwards, slick and resinous with a hop bitter finish, especially for this style; no classic coriander taste."
Ellezelloise Saisis;Ellezelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des Légendes);Watery yellow appearance with a big-bubble head, not an attractive beer.

Aroma: oxidized, bit soapy, floral, sweet, oranges and tangerines. MF: no carbon, medium to light body. Taste: very spicy start, cinnamon, cloves, bitter, little sourish, very oxidized. Guess a swing top bottle doesn’t really help for ageing.
Ellezelloise Saisis;Ellezelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des Légendes);Bottle. Slghtly hazy amber pour, with a thin almost non-existent head. Caramel, wheat, a bit of tartness, yeast, and stale bread. Not good.

Ellezelloise Saisis;Ellezelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des Légendes);2008 bottle 11.2 oz swing top. Pours hazy amber with a soft faint white soapy head that dissipates to a thin collar and a couple spots in the middle. Aroma is sweet caramel pepper and burnt sugars. Taste is flat and sweet caramel with some faded pepper and just plain old. Palate is thin flat and dry. Bad choice on taking a chance on this one, but it did not break the bank.
Ellezelloise Saisis;Ellezelles, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Ellezelloise (Brasserie des Légendes);Thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this beer. Drank in November 2011.

Aroma: fruity, including plums, currants and apples. Biscuit base. T: no detectable hops although this is only mildly sweet. Fruity, modest complexity, with a light wheat note. Little banana-yeasty flavor for style. O: low pressure upon opening and low carbonation revealed in the pour suggest a bottle past its prime. Still tasty and enjoyable but likely better fresher."

Star Pilsner;Copenhagen, Denmark;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Brewery;A yellow beer with a small and fast disappearing head. It has next to no aroma - hints of malt. The flavor is a little thin to star out with, then an OK sweetness ending on an OK bitterness. For a discount beer this is good - especially because it doesn't contain brewing cereal.

Portsmouth Maibock;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portsmouth Brewery;Draught. Brown-reddish appearance, very thin head. Medium caramel aroma. Similar flavor, lacks as much sweetness as I would like it to have. Slight alcohol in aftertatste, bitter finish.
Portsmouth Maibock;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portsmouth Brewery;"Draught pint at the brewery, 4/14/06, listed only as ""Bock"", but until I can verify whether the ""bock"" is different than this, I will just put the review here. Amber-golden highlights throughout a chestnut-auburn body, low filtration, with a strong chill haziness and a small, poorly retained walnut colored head that laces minimally. Aroma touches on lightly nutty malt notes, becoming lightly fruity from moderate melanoidins (cherries, dates, currants) and finally sweetening somewhat with a rather straightforward, but very well-extracted, caramel maltiness. Hops are lightly tangy, bouncing around in the aroma but never setting in strongly. Lager yeast bite is rather minimal on this example, the sweet caramel seeing to that. Almost more like a strong American amber ale in the nose, save for the tangy German hops and light melanoidins. Warming provides the nose with creamy toffee, a hint of toastiness and more fruits, and an even deeper, toasted graininess that grows more dry and balances the aroma further. The flavor is more to-style, shall we say, relying on light sour dough breadiness and spicy/tangy hops dryness to give the bock the bite that exemplifies the style. With warming comes the crisp yeastiness (though still rather reserved) and light mineral-soiliness of the toasty brown malts and yeast. Up front it is medium sweet, of caramel and toffee-like notes, with a touch of golden raisins and buttercream. It comes together, in the end, thanks in part to a wonderfully creamy, smooth texture, soft and round allowing the fruity melanoidins and hops room to sparkle. Gentle, moderate effervescence, no alcohol apparency and little to no wateriness."
Portsmouth Maibock;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portsmouth Brewery;On tap at the Portsmouth Brewery restaurant. Beautiful dark dark color with a huge sweet malty-ass flavor. Slightly on the watery side, but otherwise, it’s an excellent beer.
Portsmouth Maibock;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portsmouth Brewery;"I started out thinking ""Wow. I've never been so enthusiastic about a lager before. I've enjoyed dopplebocks and a few good pils, but this is amazing."" The color of fresh cherry juice. Carbonation is low and head sluggish. Flavor is all kinds of malt, mostly caramel, but also some funky malt flavors like what you get from Special B. However further into the bomber it started getting to me a bit. The low carbonation (maybe to do with it being bottled in extremely low quantities) kept this beer from reaching it's potential. Also possibly related to the way it was bottled is that it seemed to be showing a few signs of age possibly. Still a great lager though."
Portsmouth Maibock;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours with a fizzy head that quickly goes away. Sweet tasting with dark malt notes. This beer goes down really easy.

It’s full-bodied, dry and with a creamy carbonation, and flavors of burnt malts, bonfire, some coffee and prunes. Lasting mostly burnt finish.

Portsmouth Black Cat Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Dry;Portsmouth Brewery;I had this during my honeymoon. Draught at the brewery. Black of course with a thick foam. rich with dry malt flavor, much better than average of its style.
Portsmouth Black Cat Stout;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Stout - Dry;Portsmouth Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass and a mug. The appearance was a nice looking dark brown close to black color with a decent one finger white to off white foamy head that once it dissipates, there’s a decent amount of white foamy lacing that’s kinda light for the most part. The smell had a nice dry roasted coffee aroma with some light chocolate trying to come through but stays in the background for the most part The taste was mostly dry with a nice roasty sort of coffee-ness coming through. On the palate, this one sits about a light to medium on the body and it has a fairly decent sessionable aspect about it. Overall, I say this was a decent Irish Dry Stout worthy of having again.

Portsmouth Kvass Rye Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Kvass;Portsmouth Brewery;Good, but a bit disappointing compared to most of their other beers. While it had a good flavor, it was still a little thin, almost falling into the light category
Portsmouth Kvass Rye Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Kvass;Portsmouth Brewery;"This was the second sample I had at the pub that I decided needed a whole pint for tasting. Though not nearly as impressive as the Black Cat Stout, it was still worthwhile; the very faint aroma was the only real off point. Otherwise, this is a zesty, lemony, light crisp summery ale, with caraway flavor indeed present and an interesting dryness akin to some dry ciders. A little on the thin side; worth trying though."
Portsmouth Kolsch;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Portsmouth Brewery;Can from the source. Just a touch of haze in a light golden beverage with a good sized long lasting head that persists. Rich bready crackery pilsner against a spicy floral hop. Well made tasty lawnmower beer.

Portsmouth Kolsch;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Portsmouth Brewery;Draft @ the source on 24 April, 2014. Easy to drink with my dinner. Clear gold pour with a small cap of head. Aroma is light grain, corn and pale malt. Flavor starts with a grainy texture leading to traces of caramel malt. The light body and dry texture leads to notes of hay. The finish displays a bit more hops than you normally find in the style. Nothing over the top, just enough to know its there. Grassy with low bitterness. Simple style that is help by the grassy hops.
Portsmouth Kolsch;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Portsmouth Brewery;Draft at Portsmouth brewery. Deeper golden pour, grassy and sauvignon blanc like wineiness in aroma. Wineiness really carries over into flavor. Grassyn grapiness. Floral and dry fruitiness. Ok
Portsmouth Kolsch;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle courtesy doulos/goodgrief. Pour was light straw colored, thin head. The aroma was straw, some grass, sweet caramel. The flavor was caramel, bubblegum (a little off for the style, maybe toasted marshmallows captures it too), slight astringency, grassy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly full for the style, on the malty side, a tad too malty perhaps. A decent example of the style, though, just looking for more crispness, although the reviewers below seemed to all find enough crispness.
Portsmouth Kolsch;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle. Clear, dirty straw color.. Grainy flavor, grassy...just the wat one of these should be. A little oversweet finish . Still, pretty good example and pretty enjoyable.

Farnum Hill Semi-Dry Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;Bottle. Appearance: Clear golden with some white fizz leaving the body but quickly settling to nothing. Aroma: Very Bretty, but in a dry rubbery way. From far away I get tart notes but up close it’s all leathery Brett. Taste: Up front is a dry, slightly tart slightly apple flavor that leads to a heavy Brett finish. Rubbery/leathery. It lingers of dish soap. Not a fan of this. Palate: Vibrant and effervescent. Overall: Second cider dominated by Brett that I don’t want to finish. This tastes pretty bad and reminds me of dish soap on the finish.

Farnum Hill Semi-Dry Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;Sample from the Farmer’s Market. Of course there are the apple juice notes, but there’s also a pleasant acidity to go with the dry carbonated finish. The extra acidity separates it from the Woodchucks of the cider world.

Great Lakes Highlander Scottish Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Had a pint of this on tap at the brewpub before the Nine Inch Nails concert Sunday night. Nose of brown sugar, malty cereal, and a hint of resin. Pours a clear orange copper. The nice tan creamy head is mostly diminishing with thin lace. The brew tastes malty and sweet with hints of spice and coffee. The medium body is creamy, soft and feels slightly sticky at the finish. The only disappointment for me at the brewpub. I expect more from an example of this style.
Great Lakes Highlander Scottish Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);This is a great beer, from the greatest brewery ever. The beer has a very nice brown with reddish tint color. The head stayed well on the beer but did fade slowly. The body is thin but feels smooth on the palate.

Farnum Hill Semi-Dry Still Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;750 ml bottle from the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski, VT, consumed around cellar temperature in a wine glass. This is, interestingly, not even remotely still in appearance, with lots of bubbling and even a bit of fizzy foam (instantly dying) atop the light gold, clear body.....moderately sweet, rustic, earthy nose of damp humus, band-aid and oak....fairly sweet initially shading to moderately sour midpalate and quite tart at the finish, light alcohol presence throughout, very mineralic and reminiscent of a drier Riesling....becomes a bit too alcoholic in presence at the very finish as it warms. Interesting but only partially successful, just too rough and boozy.

Farnum Hill Semi-Dry Still Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;"Thanks Marc for splitting this with us! Pilsner-like yellow and with the consistency and robe of dry white wine. My friend Caro’s first reaction was ""Hey, this smells like Vanilla!"" Marc and I looked at her funny, because there was no doubt that this had nothing even close to that aroma. She then explained that Vanilla is the name of her cat. She nailed it right on the head, the first whiff is very catty (I don’t see it as a bad thing, by the way), the feline urine slowly turns to hay, then gives out wooden notes, but not oaky. It made me think of those crates they use in orchards to carry around the apples. Still and dry, with lavander notes and really tannic for a cider, I don’t really know which type of apple gives these characteristics, I checked out the website and the varietals were unknown to me (there are so many types of apples out there it’s insane!). The tannins and visible alcohol in the finish really makes it dry. As the bottle says, I agree that it’s a good alternative to white wine, but nothing to really make it stand out from whatever you’re serving it with."
Farnum Hill Semi-Dry Still Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;Same as other semi dry, lacking carbonation, and seems a little more sweet, though prolly just my imagination.
Farnum Hill Extra-Dry Still Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;Flat..obviously. Picked up 2 weeks ago @ Farnum Hill. light yellow pour. Smells nice, light with honey, sweeter apples and pear with grapes. light mouthfeel, dry finish. not too sweet. has a lot of grape, oak and pear notes.
Farnum Hill Extra-Dry Still Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;750ml bottle. A pretty damn dry cidre that has a tannic bite, presumably from lack of carbonation, woucl like to try the carbonated version.
Farnum Hill Extra-Dry Still Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;Bottle at Jimmy43s. Stemmed wine glass. The bacon grease nearly vented from the surrounding airs. Moody lighting at the bar leads me to believe that this clear, golden cider might just be a bit fainter. Smell is of tin-y apples, unripened fruit & green peppers, citrus rind, big acidity, grain. Taste is initially mellow, building to a quietly lingering acidity. Void of any real tartness. Thick/husky, apple peels & drying, mildly bitter core. Browned apples. Salad greens. Missing that suckling dry finish. Texture is more runny then thin. Quiet alcohol. Very hard for me to enjoy crazy dry still ciders without them having some other note, like a little barrel, odd florals, or just a little more sugar to make the fruit pop.
Farnum Hill Extra-Dry Still Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;Apple aroma, with an oh-so subtle hint of chocolate and funk that is barely perceptible. Crystal clear yellow, no carbonation. Dry and slightly blitter, slightly tart. Apple initially with apple core at midpalate. Oak and twigs throughout. Not dissimilar to a Chardonnay in its earthiness. Some pleasant astringency with a still mouthfeel make it velvety smooth on the palate. I at times feel like I just don’t like dry cider, but I attribute that to the fact that there are so many bad ones on the market. This, I like.

Farnum Hill Extra-Dry Still Cider;Lebanon, New Hampshire, United States;Apple Cider;Farnum Hill Ciders;Straw pour with no head. Aroma is sweeter apple with some floral aromatics, a bit of earthiness. Mouth feel is a bit thin, no carb. Not a huge fan of the still ciders, a little effervescence can go a long way. Flavor is apple, a bit of earthy funk, some good acid at the finish. Ok, but again, not a fan of still ciders.

Portsmouth St. Dammmon Trippel;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Tripel;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle thanks to Craig. Pours a clear golden color with a large white head. The aroma is pear, sweet malts and some heat coming in the nose. The flavor is slightly oxidized giving it a funky character, bitterness, sweet dry malts, very light fruit for the style.
Portsmouth St. Dammmon Trippel;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Tripel;Portsmouth Brewery;Awaiting me is the St. Dammmon Belgian-style Abbey Tripel from Portsmouth Brewery out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Just what the doctor ordered. There is nothing quite like a Belgian brew to set me once more upon cloud nine. I haven’t had any of Portsmouth’s beers yet, so I look forward to supping thirstily upon their interpretation of a Belgian abbey Tripel. Like an angel bring me salvation, the St. Dammmon Tripel pours a clear, gentle orange with a subtle yet supple halo of white foam. She is adorned in a robe of the finest lace, and as her arms reach out to comfort my battered soul, I close my eyes in sweet surrender. Thick, yeasty, doughy and sour with moist banana bread while over-ripe bananas fill out her aroma as I watch fresh dough be kneaded and rolled to create the finest artisan loaves. Light and yet full, her spirit uplifts even as I settle comfortably into her enveloping embrace. My first quaff is thinner and lighter than expected, but it doesn’t take long for her true colors to reveal themselves. She quickly builds into rich, warm sour breads, kneading dough, and banana bread practically bursting with soft, pungent, over-ripe bananas. Spice and dry grass lingers in the finish and tinges my breath. The longer we stay together, the more I am impressed by how she balances a light start with a robust middle, and a spiced, hoppy finish. A well played interpretation, the St. Dammmon Belgian-style Abbey Tripel from Portsmouth Brewery was quite tasty. It didn’t floor me, but she was a solid brew and perfectly suited to bring me back from the depths of despair I had been tossed into.
Portsmouth St. Dammmon Trippel;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Tripel;Portsmouth Brewery;Courtesy fogdog. Pours a hazy, dark golden-copper color with a small, foamy, off-white head. Spots of lacing mark the glass. The nose is mostly sweet and doughy, showing blonde candy sugar, mild toffee, phenolic, bready yeast, and hints of citrus zest. Flavors follow suit, sweet toffee and imperial pils-like malts showing strong, with more doughy yeast and citrus essence. Lightly syrupy and moderately carbonated, the palate is substantial but overly warm from the alcohol. I’m not a big tripel fan, and this one really doesn’t do much for me either.
Portsmouth St. Dammmon Trippel;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Tripel;Portsmouth Brewery;CPLYFO 09. Thanks to Fogdog for sharing. Pours a light amber, clear copper with a thin lasting head. Aroma of citrus and yeasty phenols, along with some lemony fruit and ok doughy malts. Green raisin and apple flavors form the fruity yest, lemon zest, westmalle-ish, and some bubblegum esters- hints of banana as it warms. Somewhat on the sweet side for the style.
Portsmouth St. Dammmon Trippel;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Tripel;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle from the Otown throwdown. Another brew from fogdog, yes! Copper pour. White head.

Portsmouth St. Dammmon Trippel;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Tripel;Portsmouth Brewery;"Sampled out of a bomber labeled ""St. Donmon Belgian Style Abbey Trippel Ale"". Assuming this is the same beer. Bright copper color with a thin head. Aroma is butterscotch and sweet, soft apple and melon. Flavor is fairly sweet; low carbonation for a tripel, but a nice round mouth feel. Some caramel, a little vegetal character. Pretty solid."

Stöckels Ahorntaler Landbier;Ahorntal-Hintergereuth, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privatbrauerei Stöckel;"My Bottom Line: Apricot jam and caramel limp towards a sweetish finish in this lacklustre Zwicklbier. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam covers the clear amber. -Mouthfeel is slick and bubbly. Doesn’t really serve the subtle flavour profile all that well, methinks. -More herbal hops wouldn’t hurt in the back. -This doesn’t have the character of a typical Franconian Landbier; it is well made, but tastes somewhat generic. On tap at Café Kraftraum, Bayreuth, as Stöckels Zwickl."

Portsmouth Whaddya Smokin Ale;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours with a small head and a clear orange/red color. Malty aroma with a hint of smoke. Slightly sweet ale with a bit of smoke. Don't be expecting a huge in-your-face smokefest like Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock. Pleasant enough and a good introduction to the style.

Malty/wood nose, bland malt taste. Hops are barely noticable. Ends a bit sharp, maybe because of the oak chips it was fermented with.

Will-Bräu Original Bayerisch Hell;Motten, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Will Bräu (Hochstiftliches Brauhaus Fulda);Light brownish gold in color with a rapidly retreating head, this has a caramel & bread aroma with some grassy, herbal hops. It’s both watery and slightly oily in the mouth. The flavor is sweet caramel with an earthy bitterness that turns tinny in the finish. Not destined to be a favorite.

Will-Bräu Original Bayerisch Hell;Motten, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Will Bräu (Hochstiftliches Brauhaus Fulda);Hazy, golden/amber with a small head and light particulate. Aroma is very caramel-heavy right off the bat with grassy hops adding character. Sweet Ovaltine malt in the background amidst light mustiness. Malts appear first in the flavor on top of a spiciness in the palate. It’s a downward spiral from there, however, with middle flavors turning earthen & mineral and a finish that is sour and metallic leaving a phlegmy film on the throat.

Will-Bräu Original Bayerisch Hell;Motten, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Will Bräu (Hochstiftliches Brauhaus Fulda);(500 ml bottle: $1.89 at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) Probably the least sweet imported beer of this style, it’s actually not sweet at all. There isn’t a whole lot of flavor, but the light breadiness is under control, and in the process, only a mild bitterness is necessary to keep this beer balanced. Because this lager isn’t sweet, and the bready malt is light, this light bodied beer is quite clean throughout, and the mild bitterness and slight citrusy tartness keep the palate crisp and fresh. The nose is also mildly bready and not sweet. Medium straw in color, but the beer is very hazy. The small white head settles to a wide ring, and leaves only spots and a few slashes of lace on the glass. Not enough flavor to hook me, but it’s a nicely made lager that is easy to drink, doesn’t pound the tongue with sweetness, and doesn’t leave a bad aftertaste.

James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Friend of mine had this one in his fridge. Pours amber with thick white head. Aroma of wheat, light hops and malt with some kind of additional spice. Flavor is quite mild with no one ingredient stealing the show. Interesting, but not bad... even in winter.

James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Autumn Brew Review 2004. Strange brew... Dark straw color with a good sized head. Weak aroma of wheat. Kind of a wheat and malt taste, but some spice and hops that aren’t in a typical wheat. I stick by my original comment: strange...
James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;"(12 oz bottle) Very mild wheat flavor, somewhat sweet and spicy like a Belgian with a subtle pale maltiness lurking in the background; Bubblegum finish; The spicy, light bubblegum nose has a Belgian character to it, but the nose is also a bit on the sweet side; Light bodied with a modest zip on the palate, but generally not all that exciting; Hazy pale yellow with a very small head on the pour, and absolutely no head within maybe 15 seconds; Only a handful of carbonation bubbles slowly rise toward the surface; No lacing; Different type of American summer brew, almost a Belgian Light beer, and while not great, it's decent enough and I appreciate that it's not just a boring light wheat beer like most American summer beers"
James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Thirsty, I reached blindly into the fridge, grabbed a bottle, popped the top, and poured it into a pint glass, giving little thought to what it was, but thinking it was a hefe weizen. As I finished it, I mused that it must've been a mighty weak weizen, with little hefe and scant wheat texture...then I noticed the bottle, and read the label...partial wheat malts...not far off the mark...interesting... So, the beer...appearance:slightly hazy, orange/amber color, short, disappearing head. Aroma:very sweet and fruity, sugary, a distinctive character, with orange chief at first, and banana gaining prominence later on. I kept my nose in this one for a while, very nice. On the palate, though, the sugary sweetness goes a bit too far, and comes close to cloying. Extraordinarily light in every respect, and an ideal summer slammer. Banana/clove aspects peep up, but never fully form...it's like a half-born hefe weizen. Lacking quite a bit, but neither does it pretend to much, either. A nice little summer ale.
James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Slightly cloudy. Aroma of a hefe weizen, and one of the few beers where I can actually find banana in the aroma. Flavor of a mild hefeweizen. Thin. ok.
James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Cloudy straw color,nice aroma of wheat,spice and yeast with a slight citrus side to it.The taste was very nice,wheaty with a good spice content along with a nice mellow citrus that didn't get to out of hand like on some others i've had.The after taste was much the same as the taste with a little more note on the hops and spice coming through.I have to agree with Nuffield that as it warmed it got a little rough to drink.This might be a set back but as far as i'm concerned i prefer this one ice cold for a good experience.The brew is all in all good and worth trying.
James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Not the best summer ale IMO. More like a Heffe but not too heavy on cloves as are some. Poured light yellow with small head which barely hung around. Did leave some lacing and had OK carbonation. Spicy overtones with definite but not overpowering cloves. Not my favorite but not the worse either.
James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;A hefe profile came through for me, with the clove aroma having something like artificial watermelon candy as well. Mostly clear, just a bit of haze in the dirty yellow color. This was disappointing flat in appearance and palate, with only the fact that I was eating some rather salty rice pilaf able to compensate by stimulating a nice secondary fizz in my mouth. As it warms it ends somewhat limp in the mouth. Acceptable, but with much disappointment.
James Page Summer Ale;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Stevens Point Brewery;Crisp yeastiness and noble hops. Tasted rather kolsch-like to me, with a clean maltiness.

Barley's Bambino Signorino Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout;Barley's Brewing Company;On draught at Ale House #1.

Aroma of sweet malt and roasted coffee beans. Rich, smooth body with a nice roasted character. Flavors of malt, coffee and sweet chocolate, along with a touch of hops. The finish is smooth and milky with a sweet malt and chocolate flavor. Leaves a bit of bitter coffee on the tongue in the end. Solid all around.

Hümmer Pils;Breitengüßbach, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei-Gasthof Hümmer;It’s dark golden with a very light grey hue and a rapidly vanishing head. The aroma has notes of malt, light syrup and light fruit – mostly apple, actually it seems a bit oxidated. The moderately sweet flavour gives me the same thoughts and notes, and it’s not really pils-like much more lager...

Could have been OK.

Small stable white head. The flavour starts off bready, does not taste entirely fresh. Not past BB date, unless it is over a year, as there is no year on the label. The flavour turns more malty after a few sips, with a mildly rough, grassy hoppiness. A rather complex beer for Germany, would love to try it fresh vom Fass.

Is has a hop-like aroma, but still somewhat sweet. The taste is hop-bitter, but somehow still refreshing. The palate however is somewhat shallow, and doesn't hang on.

Medium, a bit creamy mouthfeel, with an average carbonation. Finishes bitter, a bit dry, hoppy, citric, grassy, herbal. Nice one.

Schlägl Kristall;Aigen-Schlägl, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stiftsbrauerei Schlägl;August 14th, 2013 - The previous beer in the Schlagl panel was the Doppel Bock, and the next in line is the Kristall. No, not the fabulously decadent symbol of wealth, but a demure brew showing off the power of subtlety and parsimony in brew crafting. The head is a web, mottled mess, and the body is a deep honeycomb orange with a shifting sand style of haze. In the smell I catch honey and white grapes, though the vapors aren’t spritzy enough to carry the full implication of freshness that the scents express. The taste is also quite light, with a touch of white peach flesh, honey, and apple juice, served on a delicate yet sudsy palate. Another fitting entry, and an under appreciated bottle.
Schlägl Kristall;Aigen-Schlägl, Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Stiftsbrauerei Schlägl;"Bottle [from Euro Swap 7 thanks to Sebilinz] @ home. (Note: even after consulting Erich / Sebilinz we weren’t sure which beer it was, but we’re guessing this one. Bottle said ""helles"" but also 5.0% ABV.

Quite clean and crisp. Nice."
Kameleon Tripel;Westmeerbeek, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij den Hopperd;"Je ne fus pas à la fête avec cette Kameleon Triple, qui est réellement très médiocre, que ce soit sur l'équilibre notamment avec un alcool mal intégré ou les arômes peu intéressants voire même peu appréciables (on est d'ailleurs très tournés sur les herbes). Robe blond doré trouble et mousse blanche de 3 mm en verre, rien de particulier à signaler. Le nez nous donne le cap : de l'alcool, des herbes (quasi médicinales !), de l'orange et du caramel. L'alliance n'est pas spécialement fantastique. L'attaque se poursuit par des déséquilibres sur la structure en complément de celui sur les arômes : petite acidité doublée d'un alcool (8,5 % Abv) mal intégré ; Les arômes restent quant à eux ceux découverts au nez. La deuxième bouche varie peu, l'acidité disparaît mais laisse place à une alcool ressortant davantage et déséquilibrant la bière. L’arrière bouche, linéaire est quant à elle peu ample. La troisième montre alors le maximum d'amertume (celle-ci restant modérée) avant un final moyennement long sur l'alcool et les herbes. Bref, triple particulière mais surtout pas réussie."

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy pale golden/yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, pepper, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, grass, light banana/clove, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, pepper, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, grass, light banana/clove, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate yeast spiciness and herbal/grassy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, orange, peach, pear, melon, red apple, pepper, wheat, cracker, white bread dough, herbal, grass, light banana/clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, quite clean with no astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitter/spiciness and carbonation. Medium-plus carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 8.5%. Overall this is a delicious tripel. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of complexity of fruity/spicy yeast and pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and quite refreshing to drink. Likely less than a year old on this one. Nice yeast vibrancy and hop presence; with very pale malt character and color. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."

Pours a clear golden amber color with a medium sized white head. The aroma and flavor have mildly sweet malts, hints of a hard to place fruity character, slightly bitter, toasted bread a hint of earth. This is not a big beer at all, nothing memorable and I wouldn’t drink this again.
Buckeye Martian Marzen Lager;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckeye Brewing Company;From a bomber. Slightly sweet aroma and perhaps some perfumy hints of citrus. Yellow and sortah brown maybe orange inthere to. Wew, quite a impact at first, seemed a little bitter for a fest but after the session continued, it got a little better. Decent co2, yes, cleans up after you drink it for a while. Some sweet cloying attributes but never rude. A little better than most fest beers.
Buckeye Martian Marzen Lager;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckeye Brewing Company;On tap during Ohio Brew Week 2013, taster from Tony’s. Clear golden color. Little white head. Couple bits and ropes of lace. Light to medium body. Smooth, lighter, kind of soft carbonation, more dry texture. Good peppery breadiness, light hay. Moderate bitter taste, minimal sweet. Solid lager. Nothing special for me. Decent marzen, though.
Buckeye Martian Marzen Lager;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckeye Brewing Company;Light biscuit aroma, pours a clear light amber with a half glass of white head. Slight bitter taste, then a touch of tartness, finishing with the biscuit notes. Not a Buckeye beer I’ll be getting again, their other offerings have been much better.
Buckeye Martian Marzen Lager;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckeye Brewing Company;Probably not the best critic on this one. I believe the style deserves the high rating but overall this wouldn’t be a go to beer or even an occasional beer for me. Appearance & color was nice. It looked appealing.

Buckeye Martian Marzen Lager;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Buckeye Brewing Company;Pours a translucent gold with a thick, frothy head. Perhaps over carbonated Sweet, lightly malty aroma appropriate to the style. Sour, overly effervescent taste suggesting some infection in this batch.

Buckeye Hippie I.P.A.;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle purchased at Buckeye Brewing Co.’s Tapstack, Cleveland, OH. Dark orange pour with a short off-white head. Aroma of wet grass, faint citrus, and damp pale malt. Decent flavor with hop forward tangerine and grassy hops but there is plenty of sweet, almost sugary, caramel and toffee malt to be found as well. A little too sweet for an IPA as far as I am concerned but by no means a bad beer.
Buckeye Hippie I.P.A.;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Aroma: Rich floral and resin hops. Appearance: Light amber with a light head. Taste: Medium bitterness throughout. Palate: Medium body, slick texture, soft carbonation, soft finish. Overall: This is interesting. There’s big aroma of hops, but in the flavor, it’s mellowed and much more drinkable than many of the more acerbic IPA offerings. The balance is intriguing, and there’s enough there to catch my attention.
Buckeye Hippie I.P.A.;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;On draft. Cooper color with one finger head. Citrus and slight caramel aroma. Taste is similar with some floral in there too.

Buckeye Hippie I.P.A.;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle from notes. Pours a hazy deep amber color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor had floral hops, lightly toasted bready malts, caramel, orange citrus, hints of pine, grapefruit. Medium bodied. Better than I thought this would be as I may have found a pretty fresh bottle.
Buckeye Hippie I.P.A.;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Hate to say it but just not my cup of tea. Lots of malt and sweetness and just wasn’t looking for that. Not super toasted but a bitter finish. Ok overall.
Buckeye Hippie I.P.A.;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to fatknitty. Pours a mostly clear copper-amber with a medium off-white head.

Buckeye Hippie I.P.A.;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;IPA;Buckeye Brewing Company;Wow... this beer had a freakishly active level of carbonation. It took a half hour to pour this beer before my wife and I were able to drink it. It looks slightly hazy, with a dark/medium pale orange color and an off-white, wickedly billowy head. The lacing is thick and frothy, and looks like it’s sticking to the glass with super glue. The nose is clean and lightly hopped with somewhat fruity, with Cascade hops dominating. Gently. In the mouth, well, I’m actually feeling a little let down here. My wife thinks it’s skunky, but I think it’s just... odd. Cascade greets the tongue as it enters the mouth, followed closely behind by rich caramel malts. Its body feels just a little too full, and it makes that caramel feel very heavy on the palate. It’s good, don’t get me wrong, but where it seems odd to me is mostly in the finish, which is bitter - just lacking. There’s definitely a strong yeast character that seems to have stuck around. Most likely this excessive yeast was also to blame for the beer’s excessive carbonation. Maybe a thinner body and higher alcohol would help... or maybe less caramel malts. Or maybe a different yeast strain. I’m not sure, exactly, where this is off, but it could go in a few directions for improvement. It’s definitely a heavy IPA. Good, but misses the mark.

Real Ale Sisyphus;Blanco, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Real Ale Brewing Company;Seen before but never consumed, I purchased a single 2017 vintage, 12 oz bottle at the only real craft beer store in the Petroplex a couple of weeks ago. Ready to pour into my Buffalo Bayou snifter, here it goes. I note an opaque, dark gold liquid with a decent pure white head, looks like good lacing possibilities. A smell, some ripe yellow fruit and cereal. I take a full drink. A bit different taste, yellow raisin, somewhat vinous, crackers and a surprising hoppiness. Not exactly my style but I can appreciate. The alcohol is not apparent. Certainly a bottle to finish. Buy again? Likely not.

Real Ale Sisyphus;Blanco, Texas, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Real Ale Brewing Company;"From Mar 2008 I got this in a trade with JDV. Thanks Deniz! This is the 2007 vintage: It pours a clear deep amber/copper with about a 1"" head of foam from a vigorous pour. Good lacing here. The smell is very fruity(dark fruit) and yeasty? I also get a touch of caramel and some alcohol. The taste is loaded with dark fruit...plum, black cherry, some fig, and they're pretty tart but tasty but I also get some sweetish notes from the malt and some tobacco. Nice. I think this is the fruitiest BWSA I've tried so far and it's a nice slant on the style me thinks. The mouthfeel is kind of on the thin side and the carbonation is low(appropriate for a BWSA)and it finishes on the tart side because of the dark fruit. Pretty tasty fresh and I could see this would be interesting as to where it would go with a bit of aging on it. I'm certainly glad I got the chance to try it!"

Hofbrau Freising Dunkel;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);В аромате просто дохера солода, карамельные слегка жженые нотки зерна. Много конечно хлеба, белого и темного, дрожжей тоже вагончик. Цвет немного не выразительный, слишком светлый, пенка маленькая, падает быстрее Пизанской башни. Вкус средний, все портит слишком сильная кислинка, легкая не сбалансированность при глотке а также отсутствие так называемой бархотистости. А так карамель есть, много солода и дрожжей в принципе не портят впечатление. Послевкусие с намеками на патоку даже ну и конечно хмель на месте. Но в целом нормально, но пил в стиле и лучше.
Hofbrau Freising Dunkel;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);Taste: earthy dark roasted malts, some fresh hop character, bready, clean in the finish. Same with the nose. Mahogany, mostly clear, tan head some lace. Medium to med/light.
Hofbrau Freising Dunkel;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);Bottle courtesy of our landlords Peter and Elke, (cheers you two!). Had this Sunday 17th March 2019. Pours brown with a mid sized head. Light chocolate notes, a little roastiness, some dark fruits, caramel and malts. Re: fruit, I am thinking dates perhaps. Quite a decent dunkel all told.
Hofbrau Freising Dunkel;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);Bottle. Pours a clear very dark red-mahogany color with a small beige head and poor retention. Spotty lacing. Dark malts aroma. Fairly flat mouthfeel. Caramel and dark malt flavors dominate. Lightly sweet, no bitterness. Simple profile. One dimensional but very good. Very clean and easy drinking.

Hofbrau Freising Dunkel;Freising, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Hofbrauhaus Freising (Toerring);Oh, this is dunkel heaven. I've been working my way through a few Bavarian dunkels over the last months: they are now my favourite beer style, and this is one of the best. They do vary slightly, and the closest to this, for me so far, is the Augustiner Dunkel. The pour is the classic dark umber with a good, lasting head and an intoxicating smell of malt and alcohol. The first mouthful, as so often with dunkels, tastes very yeasty, but--I anticipate it now--that quickly wears off as a chocolaty, malty character takes over, rising from within the the flavour depth. Another transition is that from a fine, fizzy bite to a smoothness at the back end. And the finish packs a slight touch of hop bitterness to top off the tastebud adventure. This is my second beer from Hofbrauhaus Freising--after their Jägerbier Export Hell--and it confirms this ancient brewery knows what it's doing. In with a bullet to my top four dunkels.

Nicolet Oktoberfest;Florence, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Nicolet Brewing Company;I find more life in this than JP did - a little spicy edge tickles it away from boring. It''s decent fare with a subtle pecan sweet edge. All flavors ARE toned down, though - it''s not a big fest by any means.
Nicolet Oktoberfest;Florence, Wisconsin, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Nicolet Brewing Company;Decent amber color that lacks some clarity. Smallish head. Flavors of caramel and darker malts. Lacks nutty/roasted malt flavors. Slightly thin in body. Just a boring amber beer.
Rebellion Sven Youre Smiling;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Tested Cask Version. Dark. Not much in the way of hops, and a rather unpleasent cloying sweetness. Too much body for summer. Average.
Bison Koelsch;Berkeley, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Bison Brewing Company;Distinct and cloying raspberry aromas, white foam, color is a bit too dark for a Koelsch. A bit too hoppy to be a drinkable lawnmower beer. Still tasty. Odd and interesting -- especially the bizarre and unmistakeable fruit flavors -- that's Bison!

Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Growler. Sour milk and cola aroma. Dark opaque brown with small head. Sour/green banana or orange peel flavor - very astringent with only a light hint of malt to finish. Think something was wrong with this one - little porter character in the flavor. Will have to try again someday.
Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"On tap at brewpub. Interesting; certainly a porter, but not as roasted. Instead it was sweeter, with heavy notes of chocolate of doughy malt. Decent, but I only wanted a 10oz and they gave me (and charged me) for a 22."
Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"Leathery black with one really cool looking cap on it. Looks like a dollop of vanilla malt shake was placed on top. Nicely placed lacing in fluffy sheets with a few moth holes in em. Aroma is thick of char and ash. And that’s about it. Dry and ashy. Whoa is it ever. Wow. A bit much and a bit weird. And so it goes... Why cook out when you can drink the stuff right off your grill. Cuz that’s what this stuff tastes like. Definately smokey, ashy, charred, smokey, everything that has been fired up on the grill; corn cobs, steak, old iron, and blackened/burnt juices from various food items placed on the grill. Now with that said, it is definately not the norm for a porter, at least that I know of. This is a stretch on the interpretation of the style if there ever was one. No real balance as its all smoke, ash, and char. Interestingly unique, and a tad much, with lots of complicated smokey stuff going on. I would imagine a forest fire fighter might know some of these flavors more then I, but to me this is nearly like walking into a huge pit of ash and burnt stuff scraped from the grill. Feel is a tang of ash and smoke within a dryish, ashtray-like medium-light body with no real fashion or care to making the flavors any more interesting then they already are. One bizarre, smoke filled porter. Not something that can be enjoyed fully. Strangely capativating, yet not. If ya like stuff charred, this might be just the thing for ya."
Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Poured black with a huge tan head. Very rasty aroma with notes of coffee. The flavor was roasty and sweet with coffee and a light tartness. Some earthy notes and even some plastic.
Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"Any first impressions? -Inordinately large foam bobs atop the browned black. -The horror! Iodine-based shoe wax is not what I look for in my porter aromas. -Roastiness battles the rising iodine, and its deep wounds are inappropriately covered in wet Band-Aids. -The large, frothy bubbling and lean maltiness could have been passable, if not for the rampant technical problems. What if you dig deeper? -Roasty bitterness and wooden hops are mroe than bothered by the surging iodine. -Yeast problem, you say? Ha! -Alright, my gag reflex is about to take control, so I’m done here. -Better luck next time; this shouldn’t be on the shelves. Bottle; no date."
Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;(Bottle from the brewery) Cap opens with a very strong pffffffftt! Pours a dark cola brown with a huge tan head that eventually recedes to a soft foamy cap. Aroma is vinegar-like sour, plasticy and Band-Aid. Some spotty lacing. Mouthfeel: inconsequential because this is totally undrinkable. A sour, infected bottle of dark brown vinegar. This ratng was based on 2 bottles - both the same. Really outrageous they charge $9 or so a 6-pack for this. I will be notifying them FWIW.
Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Pours a tan, two-finger head that goes slowly and leaves a good lace. Black color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted coffee/smokey nose. Starts slightly sweet but mainly roasted coffee. Smokey/tobacco finish. $1.83 for a 12oz bottle from Maine Coast Brewery Bar Harbor, Me. And FWIW Eden was the old name of Bar Harbor until about 1870.
Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Clear dark brown color with a thick frothy light brown head. Unpleasant sour aroma. Roasty flavor with unpleasant sourness.
Maine Coast Eden Porter;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Porter;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Enjoyed at the brewery on the 4th and this was a pretty good beer. Probably the best that Maine Coast makes. Aroma is malty and coffee. As is flavor. Not too dominated by any one flavor, this is pretty well done.
Maine Coast Black Irish-Style Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Reviewed from old notes. On tap at brewpub. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown color with a bar pour’s kind of head. The smell was malty dry, light coffee persists and then a dry bitter chocolate. The taste was semi-sweet with a nice dry coffee enthralling my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a good sessionable quality about it. The carbonation finishes somewhat smooth, still good for the style. Overall, good Irish Dry Stout, I’d have it again if I could.
Maine Coast Black Irish-Style Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;tap at the brewpub - Pours dark brown with a lingering head. It smells of dark roast malt with coffee and has a similar flavor with some good bitterness. This brew is medium bodied and has a lingering, roast finish. It’s the best of the four when I visited the brewpub.
Maine Coast Black Irish-Style Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Draft at the brewery/restaurant. Finally! A decent beer in Bar Harbor. Poured like a champion Irish stout, although the bartender kept trying to knock down the awesome creamy head (ditz). There’s a nice roasty aroma, and the beer drinks with a well rounded malty aroma. Although just a bit chalky, the creamy character of the beer prevails, and this is ultimately a fun, drinkable Irish stout. (#4222, 8/21/2011)
Maine Coast Black Irish-Style Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;On draft at the brewpub. Poured a dark black color, thin off-white to tan colored head, splotchy nice lacing all the way down. The aroma was chocolate, faint coffee, faint roast. The flavor followed, the body a bit grainy and silky, smooth. In want of more coffee flavors, something beyond the chocolate, but a good brew.

Maine Coast Black Irish-Style Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;"Any first impressions? -A humongous head lingers atop the dense blackness. -The potentially tart fruitiness of citrus and white grapes blurs the rising roastiness. -Astringency mars the dry roastiness. -Unbridled effervescence expands on the mouthfeel. What if you dig deeper? -Herbal hop bitterness and roastiness battle the astringency and minerals in an awkward finale. -The carbonation would fit a Saison perhaps, but not this stout. -At this stage, this isn’t as problematic as other bottled beers I’ve had from them, but a few weeks and I think it would’ve developed some uvula-spinning iodine nastiness. -This brewery reminds me more and more of La Barberie; mostly drinkable to good fresh on tap, but really worrying once bottled. Bottle; no date."
Maine Coast Black Irish-Style Stout;Bar Harbor, Maine, United States;Stout - Dry;Jack Russell's Steakhouse & Brewery;Nice roasted grains, slightly alcoholic scent. Dark brown, almost black with a thick tan head. Way too carbonated, it made a mess just opening it. Carbonation makes it a little too acidic, but otherwise the flavor is nice, full of roasted grains and coffee. This would be a much better beer with less carbonation.

This one was turned into a fairly neutral, bland, soft malty lager with very low hop bitterness, totally forgettable. zachte, fruitige pils, in 1989 door Alken-Maes overgenomen van de toen ter ziele gegane brouwerij Campina te Dessel; te weinig hop in de afdronk."

Hops Star Spangled Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Draught at Hops Miami, billed as Hang Ten Honey Wheat. Hardly any color, so pale I confused it with a glass of water. Nothing offensive in the nose but nothing is there to begin with. Again with the water. More watery than water, unbelievable.

Hops Star Spangled Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Draft... West Palm Beach location... Mostly clear, piss-yellow ale with a small, creamy, white head. Grainy, citric aroma with a twist of lemon peel. Perfectly balanced, dry, grainy flavor with just a touch of diacetyl (hardly worth mentioning, but oops, I did). Restrained, lemony citric acid. Light to medium-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, crisp, tangy finish.
Hops Star Spangled Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);I would have taken this as more of a blonde style ale than a wheat. Does not have any of the slightest wheaty notes, more biscuity in maltiness, with some light but bittersweet fruit.

Hops Star Spangled Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Palm Harbor location. <!-- P --> Like many Hop’s beers this one is nearly aromaless with only a slight suggestion of honey and malt providing any aroma. Body is a clear golden color and is effectively headless. Light, crisp fore holds a comfortable touch of honey in the fore and middle and a very slightly floral showing in the finish. Not bad really for a a beer brewed to be low intensity. Could use more hops to balance the honey notes. This is listed here as an American Wheat, but the one in Palm Harbor seems very much to be a Golden Ale or the worst attempt at a Wheat ever.
Hops Star Spangled Ale;Madison, Georgia, United States;Wheat Ale;Hops Grillhouse & Brewery (Corp HQ);Draught at the Pembroke Pines, FL location. Very pale yellow. Neutral nose.

Very sweet, Traubenzucker , cola. Bit of metal(oxide) in the end. Sweetness intensifies in time, resulting in a long, sticky MF and finish. Prickly, but not sustained carbonation. Feels denser than it is. Decent in its kind. I think the kids would love it, if the official nincompoops wouldn’t prevent them of tasting it.
Martens Tafel Stout;Bocholt, Belgium;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Martens;Dark brown, low carbonation. Very bad beer. Very very sweet. Aroma is caramel with loads of sugar and sweeteners. Undrinkable sweet.

Bert Grant's Deep Powder Winter Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Very tasty winter. Frothy and delicious. Honey and breads are the dominant force. Rated 5/14/04
Bert Grant's Deep Powder Winter Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Had this beer on 2/17/1999. Color is a deep dark brown with good carbonation and a light head. Aroma is a dark roasted malt scent. Taste is rich and strong. It starts with a medium body that is full of a rich roasted malt taste that goes down with a slight sharpness and the roasted flavor gets a bit stronger. The finish caries the malt flavor backed with a light bitterness and light hop flavor. It makes for a good winter brew but is not as good as most Bert Grant Ales.

Bert Grant's Deep Powder Winter Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;There is a malty aroma and the color is amber with shades of copperish red.

Bert Grant's Deep Powder Winter Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;maybe i had a dead bottle (actually 2) the honey doesn’t go over too well with me. not at all bad. a little thick and not very carbonated. like kramer says sherry, toasty thats it for me.
Bert Grant's Deep Powder Winter Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;I was surprised at the low ratings on this one. Lots of coffee, chocolate, toffee and toasty malt. Silky smooth with a light sweetness on the tongue. Sort of chocolate milk like, and really tasty.
Bert Grant's Deep Powder Winter Ale;Yakima, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Yakima Brewing And Malting Co./Bert Grant's Real Ales;Aroma shows some oxidation, but a good strong caramel malty smell, I detect a hint of chocolate in there as well. The flavor sure has died down some I assume. It lacks a real punch but still maintains some clean amber roasty flavors. Palate, indeed has smoothed over and killed the hop profile. Not impressive, but still pretty decent given its age.

Power Plant Derailed Red Ale;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pour is bronze - red, very little head. Aroma is not really present. Taste is a little bit of malt, no hop, and really nothing else until the finsish, which was putrid. I certainly hope I got a bad one. Other raters I respect scored this one far higher, so I’ll give it a go next time and hopefully have an improved re-rate.
Power Plant Derailed Red Ale;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;On tap. Reddish color. Aroma is caramelly. Taste is caramelly, nutty, mildly spciy. Not too bad.

Nice and clear reddish brown with little head. Very caramelly with a great dark malt and hop bitterness at the end. Full bodied with the right amount of carbonation. Rate Beer has this listed as an amber ale, but I think it fits the Irish Red style better.
Power Plant Derailed Red Ale;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;A bronze brew with a typical head. Little to no aroma and same for any flavors. Barest of malt notes, otherwise this is vapid.
Power Plant Derailed Red Ale;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Copper color with an ivory head. Exceptional lacing.

Power Plant Derailed Red Ale;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Probably my least favorite offering from this brewery. Classic ruby appearance with a very malty nose. the flavour is somewhat metallic and unbalanced.
Power Plant Derailed Red Ale;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Light ruby color. Slight head but some visible carbonation. Sweet and fruity malt aroma (banana, bubblegum). Mostly malt flavor profile, sweetness is evident, but hoppiness is right on its heels. This gives the beer a surprisingly good balance. Some mild hop bitterness for the finish, followed by sweetness for the aftertaste. This is actually better than I was expecting, if you're at the brewery give it a try.
Anchor Summer;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);A good summer brew. Reminded me of a Kolsch. Could use a little more flavor. About average all-around (flavor almost a 7 but not quite). Kind of pricey for what it is though. Grabbed a single to sample first, but not really interested in getting again with some better stuff out there.
Anchor Summer;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);12 ounce can. Bright honey gold pour. Large dense creamy beige head. Light lemony malt aroma. Crisp light malt flavor has a hint of wheat character. Thin bodied and dry. Very refreshing, though lacking in complexity.
Anchor Summer;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);I had it from the can. It's wheat, lemon, and fruit. It's got a fluffy and smooth palate. It's refreshing but still has good flavor. There's a nice, malty sweetness to it.
Anchor Summer;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Not too sure about this one. Nice slightly cloudy yellow colour. Wheat notes as expected with a light citrus taste and slight bitterness. Not really much of anything.

Anchor Summer;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);355ml Can: Pours a clear golden with thick white head that retains well. Lacing. Aroma of citrus and marshmallow. Spicy notes fill the mouth, finishing quite dry. Interesting candy-like flavours as well. Bitterness is medium, body is medium to low, carbonation is medium. Overall the beer is crisp and clean with a great flavour. I really like this style of beer.
Anchor Summer;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Anchor Summer Wheat pours a clear golden color and sports a fluffy white head with beautiful lacing. The subtle nose leads with aromas of pineapple and green apple, backed by bright tropical fruits. The taste is acidic from attack to finish, with more hoppiness than the nose suggests on the mid-palate with light astringency and a hint of resin. The fluffy body is light, bordering on lean. Quaffable.
Anchor Summer;San Francisco, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Anchor Brewing Company (Sapporo);Summer beer campaign down at Familymart. Aroma: rather sour. Appearance: clear dark amber, minimal head. Palate: light-bodied and thin, average carbonation, bitter finish. Taste: moderately bitter, bananas and pear drops at the end. Misleading, tastes more like an IPA, where’s the wheat?
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;"The .8% alcohol you gain by picking this over the regular hoffbauer pays its dividends in splitting headaches about two minutes after consuming one of these hellish brews. Hands down the best thing about Hoffbauer beers is the ""medals"" displayed on the packaging that on closer inspection appear to be ancient roman coins."
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;clear golden yellow, small head of fine white bubbles. nose is metallic and sweet. Taste is nothing, but aftertaste is a odd mix of malt, hops and adjucts. bad.
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;if you plan on drinking this beer for taste, you’d be better off chewing on the can.
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This was just about one of the most repulsive beers I have ever had the displeasure of trying. Chalky metaalic tinges with corn and other rotting vegetables. Very light and watery with some vinous fruit flavors and alcohol
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;12 oz can, courtesy of da Iceman. Very thin yellow hue, even for swill, with alka-seltzer like carbonation. Smells like sucking on pennies. The initial flavor is a barage of old pocket change which segues seamlessly into a backend comprised of a fresh cabbage bouquet. Warming, notes of stale corn pops become evident. Thin, watery, fizzy body has no flaws other than being thin, watery and fizzy. This...is...not good.
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;This wasnt too bad. A pale yelllow appearance. The flavor had some sort of weird apple juice quality to it. It hides the booze well and its chuggable so I guess its ok? For swillathons only
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;My friend gave this to a girl in an Easter basket a few years ago. Surprisingly, she was not impressed. Don’t spend too much time on this one. Skunky aroma, corn in both the flavor and the nose, and a horrible hangover as reward.
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;When I was in school and could not afford good beer, I was would drink this stuff. For a cheap ass beer it is not bad at all. It grows on you. Its smoother than other ice beers in the same cheap arena and has a better taste. Thumbs up!
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;pretty hideous on the flavor basically its like someone threw some alcohol on some canned corn and lit it on fire. and then threw that on ice.
Josef Hoffbauer Ice;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours golden in color. Aroma is sweet and grainy. Taste is of really sweet corn and alcohol. Funky cereal type after taste. Sweet finish as well. Not a very good brew. At least it’s cheap.

Palmers Copper Ale;Bridport, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Palmers;Cask at Prince of Wales, Farnborough. 25/08/16. Torn over this beer. Pretty much zero aroma. In terms of taste/palate it’s extremely soft and sweet, but picking up very little. It is copper and has a healthy off-white head. I suppose it’s harmless - could knock back a few but not really notice.
Palmers Copper Ale;Bridport, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Palmers;13th October 2015 The Royal Standard, Lyme Regis. Cask. Clear dark amber beer, small bubbly pale cream colour head.

Quaffable. Fine!
Palmers Copper Ale;Bridport, Dorset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Palmers;Cask at the Harp, Covent Garden. Pale orange, small foamy white head. Aroma is caramelly but there’s also plenty of sulphur unfortunately. Body is light, smooth, low carbonation. Taste is citrussy, soft bready malt, light bitterness.

The aroma has notes of malt with a light note of roasted malt. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of roasted malt as well as lighter notes of wood, leading to a dry roasted finish. The body is light. Boring stout.
21st Amendment 563 Stout;San Leandro, California, United States;Stout - Dry;21st Amendment Brewery;On tap. Opaque dark brown with an orange hue and a creamy, beige nitro head. Discreet aroma of hard roasted malt and licorice. Rather light in body with a low carbonation - due to the nitro - and hence a soft mouthfeel. Notes of licorice and hard roasted malt, but also a light fusty edge. Has a light malt bitterness in the finish. 100709

21st Amendment 563 Stout;San Leandro, California, United States;Stout - Dry;21st Amendment Brewery;Draft at the Brewery. Nearly black in color with a tan nitro head. Aroma of roast and coffee. Flavor more of the same, a little sweeter than Guinness but not very dissimilar. Dry finish.
21st Amendment 563 Stout;San Leandro, California, United States;Stout - Dry;21st Amendment Brewery;Tap. Deep dark brown, small tan head. Aroma is soy sauce, coffee, roasted malts, and chocolate. Aroma is better than the flavor, which is thin for a stout--thin mouthfeel too. Flavor strongly of chocolate and roast coffee. Uncomplicated.
21st Amendment 563 Stout;San Leandro, California, United States;Stout - Dry;21st Amendment Brewery;Dark black in color with a tan head... Flavor is roasted malts with crisp clean finish... Guinness clone... Aroma faint of roasted malts... Average beer.
21st Amendment 563 Stout;San Leandro, California, United States;Stout - Dry;21st Amendment Brewery;"On tap at 21A, 4.2% abv for this batch. What can I say, it’s a nitro stout and looks the part. Super dark red (black) with the whole cascading bubble number down pretty well, and a dense, fake tan head. Light aroma of cocoa powder and some roast. The flavor is roasty and pretty dry,with a nice bitter chocolate flavor and some coffee lingering in the finish. More malt then you would get in an Irish import, and a touch more sweetness. My dad said he wanted it dryer, but then it would taste like the black water that Guinness passes of on us these days. I enjoyed the flavor, but the nitro thoroughly killed the mouth-feel for me; it was just flat and lifeless, with a fake creamy feel. I know that this would be more enjoyable out of a regular tap, but I also know how well nitro works as a marketing tool for dry stouts these days."
21st Amendment 563 Stout;San Leandro, California, United States;Stout - Dry;21st Amendment Brewery;A nice deep dark dry stout. Just a great session beer, not much to set it aside, but i’s a well done stout.

Jupiter Pedro's Porter;Berkeley, California, United States;Porter;Jupiter;Draft at the brewpub. It’s a great looking pour, almost black with a small but moderately thick off-white head. Aroma of caramel, coffee, and nuts. Initial flavor is very good with dark and milk chocolate, caramel, and almond notes. As it warms, however, the hops seem to take over and turn the beer overly bitter, and this bitterness lingers long on the palate. I loved it at first sip, but the increasing bitterness made it a chore to finish.
Jupiter Pedro's Porter;Berkeley, California, United States;Porter;Jupiter;Draft @ the brewpub. Pours a black color with a small off-white head. Has a roasted malty chocolate aroma. Roasted malty chocolate flavor with some hoppy bitter hints. Has a roasted malty chocolate finish.
Jupiter Pedro's Porter;Berkeley, California, United States;Porter;Jupiter;Poured from tap at Jupiter, icy cold, a black with brown hues and a very thin tan head. Aroma was mostly dark roasted grains and caramel. The flavor was bitter coffee, dark roasted grains, a floral peachy hoppiness, toffee, and a woody/grain husk astringency that turned tart/sour and charcoaly toward the end. Palate was dry throughout with a rather thin body for a porter and heavy tartness at the end. Overall, this was served much too cold and had to warm for full flavors to develop. There was a lack of malt sweetness to balance the harsher tones in this one. Ok at first but hard to finish the whole pint.
Jupiter Pedro's Porter;Berkeley, California, United States;Porter;Jupiter;pours near black with some tan head...coffee and malt flavors dominate with some definate bitterness, not a bad beer at all but I find the mouth feel much thinner than i would of liked and i get a little burnt flavor out of it as well
Falken Eidgenoss Naturtrüb-Frisch bio;Schaffhausen, Switzerland;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Falken;I had the opportunity to try this beer, in the dining-car from Lausanne to Bern, going to Colmar. The body has a perfect touch of copper color, average carbonatio, clear, thin and white foam. In my point of view, it was a good vienna lager, a good balance of malt, bread and a metalic side, generous note of perle or saaz hop, round and refreshing.

Falken Eidgenoss Naturtrüb-Frisch bio;Schaffhausen, Switzerland;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Falken;Review: 50 cl. Can of Eidgenoss: ABV: 5% vol Really dull looking can has a picture of Swiss cross/flag on the can, but it doesn’t really stand out amongst all the other beers on offer. On pour, dark orange coloured beer with a reddish hue and a nice big frothy white head, all looks good. Head maintains and there is also some nice lacing. The smell was lagery, got the barely and the yeast, the malts, and fruits all on the nose. Very nice and piercing, a nice smell. On taste get a nice smooth pleasant drink, that is very tasty, not bitter and very easy to quench. Nice enough mouthfuls, not bad, I like it, it is very good, very easy to drink. Malty and light bodied. A long lasting pleasant taste that is left in the mouth for one to savour. Creamy mouthfuls. Very smooth. Not a large array of flavours, and it is very light but it is all nice and easy to drink, very easy to drink. Lovely. Quiet strong actually, definitely felt the alcohol after. Like it a lot, very refreshing, recommended.

LaConner India Pale Ale (Bottleworks);LaConner, Washington, United States;IPA;LaConner Brewing Company;A bottle of this got popped around the shop sometime in 2006 or 2007. For the most part even over the beer itself I remember how excited I was to even be able to taste this beverage, which had been long gone from the shelves to the public for years. Being an IPA it had lost a bit of it’s up-front-ness, but it was still big and grapefruity, with lots of doughy malt to back it up. Citrusy goodness all the way through past the finish. I can only imagine it fresh being as close to a 5 as you can get!

LaConner India Pale Ale (Bottleworks);LaConner, Washington, United States;IPA;LaConner Brewing Company;12-oz. Thanks BillKismet! I had given up on the idea of ever rating one of these. Pours cloudy golden-amber with a white ring of foam. Earth, flowers and pine aroma. Medium body, nearly still. Taste of mango, caramel and earth. Amazing for it’s age - I’m spotting it a couple of points on overall impression just for being an IPA senior citizen. This had to be awesome when it was even remotely fresh.
LaConner India Pale Ale (Bottleworks);LaConner, Washington, United States;IPA;LaConner Brewing Company;Seriously BillKismet, thanks dude, what a treat. No. Way. Jasmine and herbal nose, gusher, lots of head. Very chewy, you can taste the hop pellets, though the bitterness has fallen off to the floral foundation. Never thought I’d be able to have one of these.
LaConner India Pale Ale (Bottleworks);LaConner, Washington, United States;IPA;LaConner Brewing Company;Thank you so much BliiKismet, I wasn’t sure if I was ever going o get to try this one,definitely a pleasant surprise. Matt knew what this one was going to do, we had a strainer ready and waited for the gush, I thought for sure there would be oxidation and loss of some of the hop aroma, but the kitchen was instantly filled with an awesome citrus fruit aroma. Great hop bitterness and hop flavor backed up by a nice sweet maltiness. The transistion from initial hop bitterness to flavor was near spot on. Awesome!
LaConner India Pale Ale (Bottleworks);LaConner, Washington, United States;IPA;LaConner Brewing Company;12-oz. Wow, wow, wow, thanks BillKismet! Can’t hardly believe I get to try this. Murky dark orangeish amber. Towering gushy head. Huge herbal, slightly buttery/spicy nose. Creamy medium body. Beautiful floral fruity hop with doughy malt on the mid-palate. Awesome, awesome beer, magnified all the further by thinking we’d never get our hands on any.
LaConner India Pale Ale (Bottleworks);LaConner, Washington, United States;IPA;LaConner Brewing Company;2004 - This is absolutely one of the most fantastic things I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. The hops are way intense, way more than anything else I had experience at the time, with an herbal stinging bitterness almost making my tongue and lips nimb, definitely tingly. The malt backbone does a great job of stnading up to this onslaught but it really gets overpowered, but you still get a lot of chewy caramel maltiness flooded with citrusy hop goodness.
LaConner India Pale Ale (Bottleworks);LaConner, Washington, United States;IPA;LaConner Brewing Company;"12 oz. bottle has "" DH "" hand written on the green cap. Amber colored with a huge head that took several minutes to settle. Massive smell of grapefruit and pine tree resins. Has a malt sweetness which mingles nicely with the huge hop flavor. Chewing on the hops will kill your taste buds. My guess is cellaring this beer for twenty years won’t diminish the hop flavor. Sept 4/2004"
Drakes Raspberry Wheat;San Leandro, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Drakes Brewing Company;Sour Rhasberry nose, tastes like not well rhasberries are added. Very bitter aftertaste and watery. Very sour, but not nice on the roof of the mouth. The color very nice orange. The more you drink the better it gets. Maybe the draft wasn't well!
Buckhead Blanche de Buckhead;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);I was lucky enough to get this beer the day after it went on tap at the Alpharetta (metro Atlanta) location of the Buckhead Brewery. I have to say I was impressed. I'm not usually big on the Belgian whites. Hooegarden was too bland for me and Blue Moon too spicy. Blanche de Buckhead, however has the spiciness of the coriander and citrus of the orange peel, but manage to balance it with the esters of the abundant yeast. Actually the yeast tasted a little more like German hefeweizen yeast than belgian white yeast, but since I don't know what yeast the brewer used in the brew, I can't say for sure. Good beer.
Whalers Lucky Charm Irish Stout;Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii, United States;Stout - Dry;Whalers Brewpub;"Draught at the brewpub. Drank this years ago on holiday but on a recent trip back to Kauai I found out Whaler’s is now closed. Just a weird stout. Seemed like a beer they called a ""stout"" because it was dark?"
Whalers Lucky Charm Irish Stout;Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii, United States;Stout - Dry;Whalers Brewpub;Draught. Body is black. Aroma is moderately malty (burnt grain, dark chocolate).

Whalers Lucky Charm Irish Stout;Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii, United States;Stout - Dry;Whalers Brewpub;It was the worst Stout I had so long. Not only because this was our last stop before we start to take of from Kauai, Lihue. Very thin almost oily finish. Dirty black color.
Whalers Lucky Charm Irish Stout;Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii, United States;Stout - Dry;Whalers Brewpub;Light roast nose and a dark black color. The nitro tap gives an attractive frothy head. Weird bitter finish that didn't mix well with the roasted malt. Thin and cardboardy. Great location (can't beat it), but the beer needs a little more attention.
Rostocker Maibock;Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock (Radeberger Gruppe);A bit reddish in the deep golden colour. Big, creamy head.

Sezoens Blond;Bocholt, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Martens;From old tasting notes. Clear, bright gold color with small bubble carbonation leading to a dense creamy off white head. Fragrant fruity malt nose. intense hop character in foretaste dominates the palate. Bittersweet malty finish and aftertaste with a hint of dry hoppiness.

Sezoens Blond;Bocholt, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Martens;"Classic Limburg ale, one of the very few from Martens which are commercialized under their own name; the name of the beer refers to the Wallonian saison tradition. Rating from old notes. Peach blonde with medium, off-white head; sweetish fruitiness (pineapple, peach, apple peel), bready and somewhat caramelly maltiness, yeasty touch, lightly sourish accent actually enhancing drinkability, herbal hop bitterishness in the finish. Nothing very complex, but balanced and relatively refined for such an old school beer, as well as very quenching. Liked this when I tasted it ten or twelve years ago, but I’ll retaste it just to be sure as it may have changed meanwhile."

River City Billys Bad Ass Lager;Wichita, Kansas, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;River City Brewing Co. (Kansas);Perhaps ostensibly in the pilsner style? Possibly also in the American standard category, but seemed all-malt. Almost in the steam style. It had a strange, lightly sweet fruitiness up front. Flabby. Highly flawed for a light lager, or acceptable if not great for a steam beer. I was told the beer was cold fermented but...? Clean, lightly bitter finish. Pale, dull gold color, no head, under-carbonated.

Thick pour with a very thick, creamy light brown head. Head stayed prominent the entire beer w an 8th inch of head remaining til the very last swig. Very dark, sweet coffee and chocolate aroma. Thick mouthfeel. This is literally if a very dark, slightly sweetened mocha was made into a beer. Heavy dark roast coffee flavors with a dark choc finish. Not at all a session beer, as it is quite rich, thick and heavy. One, MAYBE two at the most. I would love to have this on tap. Would def buy again. Delicious.
Founders Breakfast Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Fajna kawa w aromacie i smaku, trochę ziemista, spora goryczka kawowa, czekoladowa, nie zalepia. Alkohol ukryty i lekko rozgrzewa.
Founders Breakfast Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Keg at The Euston Tap in 2017. Black with a brown head. Aroma is super full, with booze soaked fruits, dates, coffee, cocoa and cinnamon. Full bodied and thick. Dark chocolate, dark roast coffee and liquorice flavours with loads of lingering bitter-sweet medleys.
Founders Breakfast Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Nera, impenetrabile, con un filino di schiuma color nocciola. Al naso non è molto pulita: le note di caffè e cacao vengono intervallate da un lieve tono di salamoia. Al palato è un capolavoro: il corpo vellutato, denso, mostra le piacevolissime note di crema pasticcera al cioccolato fondente. Il caffè è molto dietro le quinte, ma male non fa. Nonostante il tenore alcolico e la densità, scorre via veloce.
Founders Breakfast Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On n’a des notes très prononcer de Cafe c est un expresso pour adulte très bonne bière
Founders Breakfast Stout;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Te tomarías un desayuno con esto? Porqué no? Es quizá una de las apuestas que hace reflexionar la elaboración de esta cerveza. Las notas de avena, café y chocolate, llevan esa sensación a eso. Un buen cuerpo, baja espuma y no dura mucho tampoco. Además, también de sabor marcado, tiene esa personalidad que se diferencia de la Founders KBS, pero sin dejar ese sello característico.

Founders Chocolate Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Draft pour at Monterey coast brewing. Black creamy with thick tan head. Very chocolatey. Cocoa and coffee. Delicious
Founders Chocolate Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Another awful beer from Founders. Stale chocolate malts and mettalic bitterness were some of the worst qualities about this beer.
Founders Chocolate Porter;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Porter;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Dark brown color. Fruity aroma, no chocolate. Unappetizing chocolate notes in the finish. Somewhat bitter.
Grand Rapids A Clockwork Orange;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Pours a bright, cloudy light orange color with a light bubbly white head. Nose is light banana and yeastyness. Palate is nice and full with a dryness. Light hops and bananas and light fruit notes in the taste.
Grand Rapids A Clockwork Orange;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;(Sampled 7-5-08 at brewery from sampler) Non transparent and cloudy yellowish/orange in color, white ring head that actually laced, aroma of wheat, oranges, coriander, and banana. Hits the mouth with a high-thin body, the malt is weak again, a concoction of sugar, oranges, and coriander hit all the same taste buds at once and made it a very unenjoyable experience, finish lingers- which isn’t enjoyable at all. The aroma and appearance had promisings, but it ended up a train wreck.
Grand Rapids A Clockwork Orange;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;12 oz Bottle. Aroma glows as light herbal leaf and orange juice. Pours opalescent yellow, with white rim. Dry lactic tang dominates right off the bat, carrying fermented wheat. Lots of orange oils and extracts. A bright currant hop finish. A real lactic infection. Also clean. It’s obvious that the lactic infection eats up the remaining sugars in the Wit. What’s left behind is the nice orange peel and spicing, leaving a Berliner Weisse-like spice pale ale. There’s some coarse bitterness in the back end that brings this down a little bit. But, I appreciate the dry, curt sippability of this unintentionally sour beer. Thanks Sean!
Grand Rapids A Clockwork Orange;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Draft sample at MBGF07. Pours clear amber color with an average fizzy white head that was lasting with fair lacing. Light to moderate spice and orange citrus aroma. Light to medium body. Medium sweet flavor with a light citrus sweet finish of short duration. My expectations where met.
Grand Rapids A Clockwork Orange;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;"On tap at GRBC. A traditional witbier, nothing out of the ordinary or ""Americanized"" about it. Hazy yellow-orange body, medium off-white head. Sweet orange peel aroma with notes of grass and biscuit. Grassy body with nice touches of coriander, orange peel, and clover honey. Relatively light-bodied but pleasantly so."
Grand Rapids A Clockwork Orange;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;this was worse than expected, and i dont expect much from this brewery....too much wheat...i would describe this as an extreme version of bell’s oberon...orange and lemon prevalent...harsh palate...at least it LOOKED okay
Grand Rapids A Clockwork Orange;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;The name of this beer descibes its overwhelming flavor. The brewery describes this as a wit beer, but I think that this is in a style of its own. The taste of oranges pervades this whole beer making it difficult to pick out any other flavors. Expecting to taste a traditional wit (coriander, lemon, etc) I was a little thrown off by this beer. But, I give a decent rating for trying something new.
Grand Rapids A Clockwork Orange;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Some detergent was noted as well............................................
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;On tap at the Umami Burger Beer Garden & Sports Book bar in SLS Las Vegas, shaker served showing a hazed, golden hue, with a frothy layer of soft white head foam, and wavy cling to the lacing. The nose was soft grain/wheat, a hint of husk, and a subtle note of citrus. Light to medium bodied, with appropriate carbonation, the taste was similar, with modest bitterness that was lightly earthy, with a hint of pepper, and pleasant dryness that lingered into the finish. Alcohol was negligible, but posted as 4.6%. Clean & refreshing.
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Sampled at GABF 2015 in Denver. In the tasting glass this was clear gold with a white cap of foam. Nose of light fruit with bit of citrus. Light to medium in body. Flavor is big on the light fruit and there is a hint of floral hops. Finish is crisp and dry and this is very much to style and enjoyable drinking. A winner.
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Clear pale yellow pour with a white head. Nice corn notes. Light and refreshing. Spot on for the style......
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Sample at the brewpub. Clear pale golden color with a medium white head that evaporates quickly to a film. Spotty lacing. Aroma of fruit, hops and malt. Light-bodied with flavors of grassy hops, fruit and bready malt. The finish is fruity with a short mild hops aftertaste. Average overall.
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;***On tap at the Freakin Frog Nov 2008*** Palest of yellow gold with a bright white cap, good retention and 360 deg lacing. The aroma has lemon and apricots with dusty grass. Is this supposed to be some sort of fusion Wit? Super light, watery bitterness... too much bitterness I think, weak citrus and not much more really. Medium light body, no carbonation, dry and finishes with a super watery malt. This was a waste of money.
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Draught at the brewpub Pale blond color. Some aroma of paper. Quite poor Lager, only at times a light crispy touch appear. Useless.
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Pretty solid beer. Looks right. Flavor is definitely light, but refreshing. Actually not all that crisp, and a little thin in the finish, but certainly easy light drinking.
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;On tap @ Tenaya Creek poured a clear pale yellow with a small lasting white head. Aromas of bread, yeast and lemon. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of bread and light citrus with a crisp clean finish.
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Pale color, not much aroma, decent head. Very refreshing, a bit more flavorful than the average Kolsch, but still very true to style. Definitely a good summertime brew.
Tenaya Creek Kölsch;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Tenaya Creek Brewery;Typical Kolsch, a little watery for my liking though. Don’t even bother trying to drink this unless you’re in the drudges of Vegas’ frying hot summer, as then is when it will taste the best and be most refreshing..
Vermont Pub Helles Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;20080730 Tap at brewpub. Certainly not exciting stuff, and clearly meant for the masses to wash down a burger. Thin, sweet, and tart on finish.
Vermont Pub Helles Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Light lager with delicate malty aroma. Hops don’t really come through. Some toasted malt. Light body. Drinkable.
Vermont Pub Helles Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Poured an amber color with a small head. Nothing special to report. No distinguishable unique flavors, simply malt. Pretty similar to a typical lager, such as Yuengling.
Vermont Pub Helles Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;3oz sample, copper pour with a small white head. Slight malt aroma. Cloyingly sweet with malt. Ugly, funky...not my cup of tea.
Vermont Pub Helles Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Bready nose with cereal aroma. Light malt nose. Virtually no head with no lacing. Lightly bitter initial flavor, and moderate acicity. Acidic flavor mellowed toward latter half of swallow giving way to a slightly sweet, malty finish. The aftertaste was slighly soapy. I may have been the victim of an improperly washed glass here...
Vermont Pub Helles Lager;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Vermont Pub & Brewery;"Crisp, light, refreshing pale lager; definitely better than most American macros, but not what you go into a brewpub for unless you're a backwards-baseball-cap-wearing-fratboy. Light hoppy taste, some wheat & corn notes it seemed, but also some stale, carboardy textures. One of the weaker beers from this pub. Corona's cheaper if you must look for flavorlessness."
Big Time Slugfest Wheat;Seattle, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Time Brewery;More enjoyable than I expected or than my friends expected. A big full bodied wheat beer, with sweet fruit, pepper and clove spice, and a little lemony sourness at the end. Almost clear ... odd for a wheat ... but great lacing.
Big Time Slugfest Wheat;Seattle, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Time Brewery;Tap at the brewery. <!-- p --> Pours a relatively clear gold with a modest head. The aroma is fruity - lemons and pineapple and banana - with slight yeast hints. The flavors fairly much as expected - cool, fruity, sweet, banana and lemonade and bit of tropical fruit, adequate grassy hops on the close. <!-- p --> This is pretty nice, and plenty refreshing. I’d call it an American Wheat rather than a German Hefe, but that’s semantics.
Big Time Slugfest Wheat;Seattle, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Time Brewery;Hazy gold with a frothy head and nice lacing. Light wheat aroma with a hint of fruity hops. Slightly bitter with citrus throughout. A touch of yeast is noticble. Flavor is husky and malty mixed in with the wheat. Bitter hops along with citrus again. This goes down very smooth and is greatly refreshing. I’m glad I hopped on the wrong 75 bus and ended up in the U District today.
Big Time Slugfest Wheat;Seattle, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Time Brewery;Hazy golden orange. Grainy nose. Spiced (cloves) yeasty wheat flavor in the german style. Refreshing.
Big Time Slugfest Wheat;Seattle, Washington, United States;Wheat Ale;Big Time Brewery;Hazy orange with a light underbody, this beer has a pleasant wheaty and grainy aroma with the presence of banana increasing with time. Excellent german wheat flavor, with the eventual appearance of banana, cloves, and esters. Somewhat light on the palate, it leaves the taste of unripe banana. Smooth, light, and refreshing.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Sampler at brewpub. This is one of those American ESBs, you know full of hops. This one has particularly lots of hops, an offense to the style I haven’t experienced in a while. The hops are nice, sweet bubblegum hops, my tav. Once my nostrils adjust I can pick up the British dusty malts and toasty character. Same in taste, lots of awesome hops that are fresh and once I get passed the strong bitterness I taste the toasty dusty malts. Frankly I don’t want those two styles mixed but its done as the brewer intended. No complaints there just nit my scene.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Very well carbonated. Dark amber pour with a thin white head. Smells a bit citrusy. Taste is surprisingly mellow, was expecting more of a bite, but it’s a lot like drinking an amber. Very smooth. Decent brew, but there are usually better options.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Draft at btbc. Pours a cloudy dark amber with a loose white head. Light drippy lace. Toasty brown bread nose. Creamy medium body with soft carb. Toasty malty mid palate with a mild bready finish. Appealing and inoffensive.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Not the best aroma. This is pretty decent at first, some malts, but the remainder of the body is very very thin.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Light caramel and toffee notes in the aroma followed by some earthy hops. A touch fruity too. POurs dark amber with really awesome lace and a great head. Nice amber colors - guess I was the only one to find this visually appealing. Flavors of light caramel malts, toffee, burnt toast, and a soft earthy bitterness. Smooth medium bodied ale with a nice balance.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Cask pour@ Big Time. Clear copper with a viscous tan head. Nice floral hop caramel sweet aroma. Medium body. Smooth chewy mouthfeel. Toasted caramel sweetness up front, with a nicely bitter hop twang to finish. Hard to beat the cask version of any brew.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Draught. Low and quickly disappearing off-white head. Hazy muddy yellow body. Mild malty aroma. Bitter malty and salty flavor with low carbonation and a long aftertaste.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;Draught @ WABF 2008. Pours a slightly hazy copper color with an off-white head. Sweet malty caramel aroma with some weak hints of hops. Sweetish malty caramel flavor with some hoppy hints. Has a slightly sweetish malty caramel finish with a citrus hoppy aftertaste.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;On tap at WABL Brew Fest 2008. Pours clear copper with a lacy white head. Medium-light body & light carbonation. Definitely in the ESB area code, but there is an estery quality that doesn’t quite fit.
Big Time Paxtons ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Big Time Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Pous a hazy gold without much head. Seriously fugglesy aroma, somewhat swampy, mavellous hop blast on the flavor at nearly IPA strength. plenty carmal-malted compared to the British renditions (and also a bit more citrus hops). This is a curious beer, but it is actually a pretty darn drinkable one. Nice!
Bitter End No Hotel Hefe;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Definitely tasted a little sweeter and a little more watery than most hefe's, but good nonetheless.
Bitter End No Hotel Hefe;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;I decided that I'm knocking off a point from the standard 4 of any beer that is served with a lemon that I didn't ask for. I definitely got a banana taste in it along with the cloves. What it did have that set it apart from other hefes was stronger notes of sweetness which I found to be a plus. Definitely not bad.
Bitter End No Hotel Hefe;Austin, Texas, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Interesting hefe...it didnt have that banana taste that most hefes do. It was citrsy with notes of clove though. Very crisp and refreshing, notes of cereal in the finish.
Matt Fire Company Premium Brew;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;well i suppose my thoughts about how old this bottle must be are correct ! today this brew tastes like an old ale. and a good one i might add. malty with that old rummy alcohol flavor yet still a bit of fresh farm flavor of straw and wet hay rounding it all out. deep dark fruit punch flavor that is butterscotch sugar and lingers a bit i doubt it tasted this way before it sat in a dank deli fridge on 9th ave and 40 th st NYC for years but hey it’s good now. of course looked pale when bottle put up to light but got cloudy as a wheat beer when poured. REST IN PEACE GOOD SOULS!
Matt Fire Company Premium Brew;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;(Bottle 35,5 cl) Apparently composed from a recipe by a retired firefighter as support and homage to the policemen and rescue workers of 9/11. Amber coloured lager with a pretty decent head. Malty with excellent hop aromas.
Matt Fire Company Premium Brew;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;This beer is an american amber lager witha tarty after flavor.I liked it alot.The appearance of the bottle I really liked. Can anyone tell me where I can buy this beer?
Matt Fire Company Premium Brew;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Contrary to the description, this is an amber lager. The malts used in this are very good, and it could have almost passed for a bitter ale. I'm going to leave aside the whole ""a portion of the proceeds goes to Police, Fire..."" etc., and just talk about the beer. Light to medium amber. Decent mouthfeel, tart in the finish which hips you to the fact that its lager, I guess. Drinkable, but perhaps commerically maudlin."
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"’Versnijbier’ (blended beer) sold as Cherish Kriek outside of Europe; does show a certain lambic tartness and woodiness, but for the most part it is just as sweet and syrupy, even artificial, as the ’industrial’, sweetened fruit lambics we all know. Not my cup of tea."
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"8.4 oz bottle to snifter. This bottle is labeled Cherish, and has been merged with this name. Looks decent; undercarbonated though. A semi-transparent ruby with virtually no lacing. Smells like cherry cough syrup. Tastes like it smells with a bit of tartness. Medium-bodied and a little sticky. Not bad, but medicinal."
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"""looks similar to belgian red or lindemans kriek. smell is quite nice. fresh cherries, non-medicinal. still tastes like a beer-not oversweet, but assertive. i’ll buy again. don’t know about the 8.4 oz. bottle though."""
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Red cherry color with a moderate head and good lacing. Aroma of sweet cherry skin and somewhat like a cherry soda. Taste is sweet cherry skin with a bit of tartness. Soft mouthfeel and light bodied with high carbonation. Flavor is not very complex.
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;2013 to a snifter. Pours a clear cherry red with a small white head. Aroma is sweet cherry. Taste is a slightly sour and tart cherry 7 up. Slightly dry. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;A red wine color. Smells of cherry cough syrup and not much else. A nice sweet cherry taste with a just a hint of sour, dry, kind of like a cherry soda taste. Not bad but sweetness overpowers another flavors that may be there. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Reddish pink with a pink head. A little milder than most lambics. Not very tart or full bodied.
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Bottle. Poured a ruby red color with a smaller white head. Aroma was dominated by cherries and what smelled like cherry cough syrup. Flavor was very sweet and had lots of cherry flavor. Malts and syrup in there. Kind of a tart acidic aftertaste. Average beer at best.
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Old 330 ml bottle a purple colored beer with a tiny white head aroma cherries candy some sourness and sugar flavor cherries candy sugar and some spicy and sourness
Bios Kriek;Ertvelde, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;A red beer with a barely there pink head. The aroma is dominated by cherry, of course, as is the flavor. I don’t have much experience with many lambic beers, but the flavor and aroma are pleasant, though a bit too sweet to drink a lot of.
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;Cask at The Moon Under Water (JDW), Watford in 2012. Murky brown with a scummy white head. Aroma of chewy grain, caramel and straw. Flavour is full on malty, with biscuity and toffee notes. Fairly sweet.
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;Since drinking this dark ale for the last 10+ years. Trying a pint in my local tonight I was disappointed to discover that it was now a amber beer with a weak happy taste with a hint of chestnut. Very disappointed
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;Bottle. Orange Amber. Sweet, tangy, citrus-fruity, marmalady, toasted-malty ale with full hop flavour. Dry malty bitter finish. (2008)
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;Bottle thanks to allmyvinyl. Appearance - a lovely amber with a decent head. Nose - toffee and red fruits. Light orange peel. Taste - toffee, biscuits and tangy fruit. Palate - light to medium bodied with a creamy yet tangy texture and a long dry tangy finish. Overall - nice ESB.
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;500ml bottle thanks to my big brother. Pours clear red-brown, thin white head. Aromas of red fruit, hazelnuts, mixed peel. Taste is fruity, light malt, light soapy bitterness. Not bad.
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;light brown in colour malty on the aroma and taste with a little bitter finish don’t think i wouldn’t rush to have it again
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;smells of nothing, dark gold foamy white head. tastes like unsalted crisps which must be the only thing good about it?
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;Cask @ The Olde Sun, St Neots. Light to mid brown, clear. Full white head. Toffee/caramel and alcohol in the nose: smells stronger than 5%. Multi-layered taste: the initial sweetness masks an intense bitter edge. Apparently now only available during the Christmas period, so seek it out while you can.
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;Bottle conditioned: 500ml’s best before the end of Oct 2012, some 5 days away. The beer is 5% ABV and was poured slowly @ home into an Abbot Ale glass tankard. No sediment left the bottle in my gentle pour: clear, bright, chestnut reddish body, the head a full covering of white foam which hung around for the duration of the tasting. Feels and smells like a ’winter warmer’ sort of beer, rich, woody and Christmassy. The malts are roasted and full flavoured in the aroma and taste, toffee being the main maltiness I got. Fruity hop notes in the mix as well, a liquid toffee apple with extra candid fruits as the beer warms in the glass. The actual body depth isn’t that heavy or full, but the flavours carry the beer nicely and the 5% ABV sits well overall.
Woodfordes Admirals Reserve;Woodbastwick, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Woodfordes;Cask, JDW, Carlisle. Toffee-tasting amber beer that lacks any great aroma. Sadly, quite bland, with an almost synthetic sugariness on the tongue. Some late fruitiness saves a bit of face, but generally disappointing.
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);From old tasting notes. Bright yellow gold color. Fluffy white head. Fragrant malt nose. Refreshing honeyish malt flavor hints at lemon and peppercorns. Refreshing floral hop finish.
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a medium golden with a medium white head. Aroma of sweetness and citrus. Taste of the same with some hops coming thru. This light bodied brew is well balanced and easy to drink.
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Pours gold with a white head. Smells of sweet malt, some wildflowers, perfumy. Tastes sweet and crisp with some fruity hints and a grassy finish.
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Golden pour with smallish fizzy head and no lacing. Malty aroma. Flavor was light grainy malt with a mild hop bitterness. High level of carbonation present in this one as well. Kind of boring...but it is a blond ale, so go figure.
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);"pours a clear amber with a white head. aroma is hoppy; light sweet citrus and floral notes. taste is crisp, a bit sweet, lightly hopped with a smidge of pine. mid-light bodied with an average carbonation. smooth, nicely rounded. quick finish. decent lacing. would be a great session beer or just a nice refresher on a summer afternoon. bonus points for the low price."
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);Had this beer on 9/14/1999. Color is a hazy gold. Taste is damm good. Light body goes down smooth with a very good hoppy finish.
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);12 oz bottle, thanks to Secret Santa! Pours orange and semi-clear. Very malty grain, and sweet bread like aromas. Smells like brew day. The taste is straight golden ale. Very light grain, with just a hint of sweetness. Fairly plain on the whole. Light watery body. There is nothing offensive about this brew and no off flavors or aromas. It’s just kind of blaa.
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);I sampled this hometown beer poured from the bottle. The beer had a long-lasting white head and was a full amber color. The flavor was both moderately bitter and sour. It had a medium body with lively carbonation. A somewhat grainy aroma of hops can be detected.
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);"12 oz Bottle-Pours a cloudy golden color w/a slight white head which dissipates quickly. Grassy, citrus aroma. Crisp, clean grainy flavor w/traces of fruit & lemon. Very fresh tasting with decent carbonation which seems to add to the flavor. Very smooth-very refreshing-very drinkable. Reminds you somewhat of a witbier. Good choice if you are looking for a refreshing ""summer"" brew."
Blue Ridge (MD) Golden Ale;Easton, Maryland, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wild Goose Brewery (National Brewing Company);12oz bottle via trade with hopscotch! - Thanks Jason! - Pours golden with a short white head that didn’t stay long. Aroma is mostly light grains and not really much there. Flavor is much more fruity. Lemon notes, over those light grains. Some light hops. There just isn’t much to this one. It is light and refreshing and crisp and clean on the palate though. A fair session I guess and would be refreshing in the summertime.
Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;(11/16/08) Draught sample at the brewpub in Philadelphia. Aroma has some artificial blueberries, some soap and other bad off-aroma I’m sure how to describe. Nasty sweet artificial flavor with saccharine. Light-bodied. Horrible.
Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;Draft. Pours clear yellow with little head. Aroma is blueberry juice. Watery body.

Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;Tap @ Manayunk. Poured a clear yellow color with a white head. This beer had a strong blueberry aroma. Mixed with the malt it smelled like a blueberry muffin. That was nice since the beer was my breakfast. The flavor was also a mix of malt and blueberry with a hoppy bitter finish. The finish was crisp.
Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;Light golden color with a subtle blueberry aroma. Taste is light and a bit sweet with blueberry and grainy flavors. OK for a fruit beer, but nothing special.
Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;On draft (kind of). Ordered a draft and the bartender pulled a pitcher out of the fridge and filled my beer in a plastic cup. It’s things like this at Manayunk Brew Pub that continually dissapoint me. Anyway, poured a hazy gold with virtually no head. Sweet aroma with a faint touch of blueberry. Flavor was sweet with very minimal blueberry flavor.
Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;On tap at the Manaynk Brew Pub. Poured a medium golden color with a smaller sized white head. Aromas of blueberry and light wheat. Tastes of blueberry, wheat, and had a general fruitiness to it. Light honey sweetness. I found the blueberry aromas and tastes to not be over powering and done just right.
Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;This was a nice fruit beer. The hue was golden with a tad of green/blue. The aroma had a great natural blueberry and muffiny smell which I absolutely savored. The flavor had a natural blueberry taste, with some finishing hops. The palate was smooth, and the beer very refreshing. Had the IIPA and a delicious porter not been on tap during my visit, I would have had no problem ordering another of these, or even grolwering it, for that matter.
Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;"A lot of blueberry smell and taste. Overall, though, not a bad beer. It has some of the microbrew""sterile"" flavor, but a decent amoutn of taste. I typically don’t like a fruity beer, but this is pretty good."
Manayunk Blueberry Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Manayunk Brewing Company;Good God this is an awful beer. Sampled on draft at Zeno’s in State College PA this beer poured a nice dark golden color. The aroma is mildly fruity and vinegary. Taste was pure vinegar with just a dash of artificial blueberry flavor. Pure stubbornness alone kept me from demanding my money back.

Rebellion Mutiny;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rebellion Beer Co.;Fat, oily and malty. Fruity and sweet from the malt with no head on a deep mahogany pour. A little bit of citrus and exotic fruit in the hops. Very drinkable.
Rebellion Mutiny;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rebellion Beer Co.;The big brother to IPA and Smuggler, this is a typically malty ale. Neither aroma nor finish are particularly pronounced but has a nice mouthfeel which makes it very drinkable. Wouldn’t describe it as an ESB though, more an old fashioned special bitter. One for the malt fans, best avoided by the Hop Nazis.
Rebellion Mutiny;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Rebellion Beer Co.;Really lovely, full beer, balanced and without either being a bitter or a stout or mild, it slips nicely into its own groove! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

A paler bitter than normal from Rebellion but still manages to be dominated by a sweetish, fruity malt character.

Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);An unimpressive sour ale. More acidic sweetness than any tartness. Medium bodied.
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);No notes on this, only numbers....however it was a gorgeous day to sit on the patio watching people.
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Cask@Steamworks Brewery Brewpub, Vancouver. Dark brown beer with a lightly fruity and musty aroma. The flavour is bitter and warming. Overall a very average beer where you struggle to taste the fruit.
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Lots of fruit in the nose, but not nearly as sour as I was expecting. Slightly medicinal but not sweet or syrupy, just really nice fruit. Soft on the palateand has the slightest bit of sour on the tail. This would be great if it was bigger, barrel aged for about 3 years with some brett added.
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);I don’t make it down to the brewpub often enough to get in on the sour cherry every year but when I have had it, I found it surprisingly delicious, with a lovely color and surprisingly assertive tartness. Sure, it’s not the world’s best cherry beer but I wish more BC brewpubs would make interesting beer. I’m tired of the array of crap on tap.
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Amber with hints of red. Light head and some stringy lace. Slight hint of cherries in the nose along with some bitterness. Malty and a touch sour. Some more of the cherry comes out, though it’s not too profound. Bitter at the end with a smidge of cherries.
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Ruby color, thin white head fades to nothing very quickly.Acetic cherry nose. Tart and vinegary taste, very light cherry flavor,bordering on the edge of just being vinegar. Poor effort
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub on Thursday, November 23rd, 2006. They referred to this as the Sour Cherry Kriek. Pours a thin, white dissipated head with a ruby orange body. Nose of sour cherry pits. Tart. Tonic. Cherry. Hmph... seems right.
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Tart cherries with plenty of underlying sweetness and strong spices (clove, cinnamon) in the aroma. Clear amber body is topped by a low but lasting, fine bubbled, off white head that leaves some lace as it eventually recedes to partial cover. Spicy cinnamon and cloves are joined by light banana esters that complement the tart cherries. Sweetness builds throughout but stops short of cloying. Alcohol notable in the aftertaste. Medium body is quite dry with lively effervescence and some alcohol warming. Sampled on tap at the brewpub while watching the snow fall!
Steamworks Sour Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Steamworks Brewing (Canada);Cloudy amber colour, i found that the aroma was fairly strong, but i could not tell exactly what it was, there was cherry, but also something almost smokey. The taste however i found to be very cherry with what felt like a hint of spice. A little cough syrupy almost in flavour.
Wells Summer Solstice (Cask);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Sampled this ale at the Last Post, Paisley in July 1999. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear amber in colour with a loose frothy white head. Slight citric notes in the aroma. Tasted like a very weak version of Burton Ale but sorely lacking in the complexity and range of flavours one would expect from this English brewery. Biscuit malt evident but metallic hop notes overpower any malt & fruit present. Astringent hops continue into the metallic finish. A poor session bitter.
Wells Summer Solstice (Cask);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Handpulled cask at the Red Lion in Radlett last year. Amber with a thin white head. Although totally clear the predominant flavour was yeast and citrus hops were only just detectable. One of the poorest summer ales I’ve tried.

Wells Summer Solstice (Cask);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Cask, The Lamplighter, St Hellier. Amber with a small head. Aromas are caramel malts with yeast and citrus. Quite soft in the hops. Flavours are sweet toffee malts with soft citrus and a gently hoppy finish.
Wells Summer Solstice (Cask);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Pint at The Queen Adelaide, Wandsworth. Not very visually impressive - clear light amber with no head, but a nice aroma of hops and cut grass. Flavour is distinctly yeasty but the palate is reasonable and there is a pleasant cittrus aftertaste. Overall, a very refreshing summer ale that is better than the sum of its parts.
Wells Summer Solstice (Cask);Bedford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Charles Wells [aka Eagle Brewery] (Marston's);Cask gravity at Bowl Inn, Charing. Gold colour with thin off white head. Some yeast, some lemon citrus aroma. Again, fine, just a little bland. Easy drinking. Decent lemon citrusy finish which lifts the whole beer.

Carling Black Label Beer (South Africa);Sandton, South Africa;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;SAB - South African Breweries (AB InBev);Not a terrible lager. In fact my favourite of the generic SAB crop. It's a cheerful beer....to me anyway. With a little bit of banana flavour somewhere. Problem is that there are now so many exceptional beers available that there doesn't seem much point in buying it. Nice on a hot day after a long surf.

Sugar, bubble-gum hop fruit aroma. Clear amber appearance. Apple juice flavor and consistency. Wet finish, even carbonation. It's light enough to be appreciated during a porch-sitting, but not an ideal session ale.

Carnegie Porter 3.5%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Porter;Carlsberg Sverige;"04-12-2018; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in Sweden). The looks of the beer are nice. The color of the beer is a dark ruby red/brown. The beer has a nice ruby red glow. The beer seems to be clear. On top of the beer there is a almond coloured layer of frothy foam. Foam retention is low. A small drape is left on the beer after a rather short time. The aroma of the beer is very weak. There are just some light toasted malts, with hints of chocolate and caramel. Very mild and also a bit bready. Hops are just simple. They give some spicy notes, but way to mild. I expected more. The taste of the beer is also not extremely great. Medium sweetness, dry bitter hops. Rough, not extremely balanced. Should and could be better. The palate of the beer is also weak, especially for a Porter. Medium-light body, sticky thin texture, high carbonation. The finish is almost non-existing. Some malts at first followed by very dry bitterness. All in all, a weak beer. Not as the Carnegie Stark Porter, what I expected this beer to be like."

Proef lichte tonen van chocolade, koffie en licht rokerig, licht kruidig met o.a een klein rozijntje. Cola kleur met crème kleurige schuimkraag. Kuddo’s voor smaak gezien het lage percentage. Geur neutraal.

Carnegie Porter 3.5%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Porter;Carlsberg Sverige;Served up from a brown bottle in a cruise ship bar on a Caribbean trip. The tall fluted glass shows a dark, almost totally black body and a decent almond colored top. The smell is of licorice and grain. A drink gives back malt, grain, pecan and a bit of chocolate sweetness. Firm bitterness at the finish. Not great but pleasant.
Grand Rapids Scotch Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Draft sample at MBGF07. Poured dark brown with an average fizzy brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Light to moderate toasted malty aroma. Medium smooth body. Flavor was a good toasted balance of bitter and sweet with an average bittersweet finish of moderate duration.
Grand Rapids Scotch Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Tap @ MBG brown with decent white head. Very muted aroma only a little malt. Flavor has decent amount of caramel and some strange spice, but not much going on at all.
Grand Rapids Scotch Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Medium brown bodied, faint off-white head. Rummy, fruity and nutty nose. Another scotch ale without any peaty character unfortunately, focusing perhaps a bit too much on spicy earthiness, cardamom and cinnamon reminiscent. Caramely, toffeeish scottish accents. Restrained hops. Strong and sweet. Medium bodied, malty, light carbonation.
Grand Rapids Scotch Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;"a nice dark reddish brown appearance with little off-white head....aroma was of fruits and malts; flavor was odd, yet appetizing (sugars malts with a touch of scotch)...palate was typical of GRBC, a tad watered down"
Grand Rapids Scotch Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Draft at MBG as a 2003 bourbon barrel aged brew. Smokey flavored. Dark brown. Aging has served this well I believe. Very smooth.
Grand Rapids Scotch Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;"Dark brown appearance. Nose is malt and touches of fruit. The body is hoppy with notes of smoke and a sweet malty backbone. One of the better beers from this brewery. When I had it, it was called ""Braveheart Scotch Ale""."
Grand Rapids Scotch Ale;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;Excellent version of scotch ale. I have to include the disclaimer that this is not my favorite style of beer. But, I really enjoyed this particular interpretation. True to style, this is very malty and high in alcohol. Some butterscotch overtones can be noted. Ends with the smell of acohol, but I didn't really notice too much in the flavor. I would like to have tried this beer sometime in the spring or fall. Overall impression: a great seasonal offering from one of Grand Rapids best brewpubs.
Maclay Tam O'Shanter Ale;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Had this in the City Hotel Dunfermline when it was first released which I believe was for Burns Day in 1995. Deep oak brown to black this had a rich yet perfectly balanced structure of rich roasty nuts, toffee and earth. Dense magnolia head. Beautiful.
Maclay Tam O'Shanter Ale;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Cask at the Southsider, Edinburgh. Vintage notes from January 1997. Digging out these old notes because this beer seems to be retired. No great loss. Sweet and malty. Minimal hop influence. Slightly sticky stuff. Didn’t like it at all. According to my notes it was 4.1% way back then for what its worth. 4/10 on my old scoring system. Made at the old Maclay brewery (long since gone) in Alloa back in those days of course. I’m not sure this one survived the transition to contract brewing at Belhaven.
Maclay Tam O'Shanter Ale;Glasgow, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Bottled. Ruby red with moderate head and condition. Aromas of malt and buttery hop. More roast malt in the mouth and a smokiness that wasn`t apparent in the nose, finishing sweet and malty

Aass Hveteøl;Drammen, Norway;Wheat Ale;Aass Bryggeri;330 ml bottle. Golden body with a medium white head. Aroma and flavor like any other Aass pilsner, just a bit more fruity and perhaps even lighter body. Definitively no wheat beer this, just another pale lager with a small amount of wheat. Actually really boring.
Aass Hveteøl;Drammen, Norway;Wheat Ale;Aass Bryggeri;This test is some years old, so I don't know if theys still make it....They pretend to have made a Weizen - but they have not. More like a modern lager, with some wheat added. It's a bit fruity, a bit malty and a bit hoppy. Result: A bit anonymus.

Not much aroma, just a hint of pale malts and white bread. Mouthfeel is thin, but sharp, bitter, well carbonated, refreshing and extremely drinkable.

Aass Ice Beer;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;0.5l can. This is a clear pale golden beer with lots of unfiltered particles and quite the big just off-white head. The aroma is light hop-dusty and mildly malt-sweet. Not much more. Fizzing and average carbonation level with a thin and quite watery mouthfeel. Weak flavors. It should perhaps have been served a bit colder to camouflage the flavors even more. Not sure it would have been anything left to taste then.. Thin hints of sweet caramel-butter in the finish. It’s no off-flavors what so ever in this one, but it’s just extremely plain.

Mildly malty with low hop rate and no bitterness. Rather edgeless. A weak effort by Aass, but their malt structure is quite superior to most commercial brewers, so the even their Ice Beer is pretty drinkable.
Aass Ice Beer;Drammen, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Aass Bryggeri;Handsome penguin-adorned silver tin swigged in Vigeland Park. No idea what the contents looks like. Slick creamy m/f, hay, flour, discreet honeyish aroma. Clean and faint with grass and almond milkiness, some clinging....erm, hop? Bitterness, anyway. Not digging the slushy fat feel of this at all.

Kraftbrau Extra Special Bitter;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kraftbrau Brewery;Whew! On tap at the brewery. This was not good.

Kraftbrau Lawnmower Lager;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kraftbrau Brewery;White gold with floaters. Looks like a belgian white, frothy white head. It kind of stinks. Strong sulfur, egg odor that plagues a lot of Kraftbrau’s beers. Sour pungent odor, too bad. The taste is really awful. Quite a sour beer but does also taste like they took a bunch of lawn clippings and added them to the beer. It has a lemony grassy taste. And it counts as a summer beer. Dry finish. I cannot believe that anyone thinks this is any good. I’m sorry. I support local beer but this one sucks.
Kraftbrau Lawnmower Lager;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kraftbrau Brewery;This really hit the spot, even though it is light. Cloudy light yellow body (almost the color of lemonade, quite suggestive), with a thin, clumping off-white head. Grassy wet hay hops aroma with some biscuity malt, slightly tangy. Biscuity, grassy body with a touch of pepper, not tangy or sour, but crisp and light with a clean, smooth finish. Good.
Kraftbrau Lawnmower Lager;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kraftbrau Brewery;Pale straw yellow with a large fizzy and fading head, some lace. The aroma hints of buttery biscuit, chalk, veggies, floral, and a touch of citrus. The taste is shockingly lemony and almost weiss like, that is almost. The tart and bitterness covers most malt and leaves you with a crisp and clean taste. The mouthfeel is fizzy and watery, but duh, it’s a lawnmower lager for pete’s sake. All thing considered, this beer is better than I expected.
Kraftbrau Lawnmower Lager;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Kraftbrau Brewery;Actually, this is a bit better than I expected. It's an unfiltered light yellow lager.

Tastes of orange peel, pine and I swear celery leaves. Thinnish body with lots of carbonation on the tongue. As it warms it gets more of a raw hop juice burn. Enjoyable pale ale but better with a sandwich.
Kraftbrau Pave Pale Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kraftbrau Brewery;A cloudy copper-colored beverage with a thin, off-white tan head.

Kraftbrau Pave Pale Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Kraftbrau Brewery;A fairly hoppy pale ale, with fair body, deep bitterness, relatively little fruitiness. My aroma and flavor was all bitter hops, tinged with malt. Perhaps it wasn't fresh enough to get the sweet fruit that dabosk and marinaro500 got...who knows? But not bad, just doesn't distinguish itself.

Kraftbrau Bird in the Hand;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kraftbrau Brewery;If Kirtland’s Warbler knew it was the spokes-bird for this autrocity, it would hire Johnny Cockran, sue Kraftbrau, win, then buy kraftbrau, bulldoze it to the ground and plant a jack pine forest over its remains. I, like Silph, at first thought this was an infected bottle, but reading other ratings, either every bottle and keg of this stuff is infected or it was a putried brew that was bottled against its will. I certainly hope the latter is not the case. Regardless, the quality control at Kraftbrau is to be berated. It is always a bad sign when you open a beer and it weeps from the top as though expressing its bubbly shame. I find not figs or raisins in the taste, rather taint, swamp-ass and vinegarish putridity. Do not try this beer unless you have a hot plate of fish and chips that needs some dressing. Long live the Kirtland’s Warbler, may he be avenged.
Kraftbrau Bird in the Hand;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kraftbrau Brewery;I admire the idea of putting the kirtland’s warbler on the label, but this beer is an injustice to that rare avian resident. The beer overflowed the bottle after I opened it (usually bad news), and the aroma was initially disturbing with burnt rubber, tar, vinegar, and red wine character. Sadly, the beer was almost undrinkable as the same characteristics spread to the flavor. I don’t believe the beer was infected, but it was rather foul, with burnt rubber/plastic ruining the palate. Dark fruit, including fig (at suggestion) were apparent, as was asphalt and metal. The jack pine plains and the kirtland’s warbler deserve better than this pathetic effort by Kraftbrau. I fear for my health after drinking this beer. This beverage is about rarity- it will kill you off if you’re not careful. Avoid it.
Kraftbrau Bird in the Hand;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kraftbrau Brewery;Brown hue with a rocky tan head and good lace. The aroma hinted of sweaty and earthy yeast esters, grapefruit, light pine, vanilla, dust, grainy and toasted malts. The initial taste was twangy yet earthy, different. The finish had a bitter bite and light alcohol presence noted. Rough mouthfeel, just didn't feel right. Okay I guess, but the palate took some abuse. Very earthy and dusty character.
Kraftbrau Bird in the Hand;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kraftbrau Brewery;Didn''t really see how this matched an Trappist-style ales. Dark ruby color with no head. Some sweet tones - cherries, alcohol and malt.
Kraftbrau Bird in the Hand;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap, this was lifeless and seemingly infected. Luckily, BBB63 brought a bottle over and it was much better. Alcohol, musty nose with hints of fruity yeast and pale malts. Medium bodied and somewhat grainy mouthfeel. Nice yeastiness and freshness unlike the tap version, as well as a nice hoppy and alcoholic snap at the finish. Much better than the initial 1.2 rating..
Kraftbrau Bird in the Hand;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kraftbrau Brewery;Not a bad Belgian styled beer from the US. A little too sweet, even if they are shooting for a trappist like daboskabouter says. Nice dark red color with a good sweet, raisin-ish fruity flavor to it. Another good offering from Kraftbrau.
Kraftbrau Bird in the Hand;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Dark auburn appearance. Sweet malt and light fruity notes in the aroma. Body is much too sweet, sugary. Notes of dark fruit and sweet malt. Not much to the brewers claims of ""trappist style"", but it is one of the more interesting from this brewery."
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Unfiltered draft sampler at Kraftbrau. One of only 3 ales out of 12 taps here. This is actually a very dark dorwn, even in a sampler glass. Thin head on top. The malts seem more mellowed than roasted, it seems. Hops and yeast give it a nice fruity profile, not citrusy or overbittered; maybe like a pear or a ""Juicy Fruit."""
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;GTotMW. Red in color with a nice head. Hops and sweet malt in the nose. Nice balanced flavor, hops sweet & toasted malt. Bitter and finishes smooth. This is a really good red, the best one at the Great Taste.
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;HUGE light brown frothy head, and a dark red/amber body. Pleasant and surprising hoppy aroma. Mostly pine, with an astringent/spicy resin to it. Strange fruity burnt nuts with coffee hints (a bit like chicory) and over the top peppery floral taste. Mouthfeel is decent, and body is good.
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;poured a dark amber with a massive tan foam with nice lacing. nice earthy hop aroma. Taste is of floral and piney hops, sweet malt, and some roastiness with an earthy like mouthfeel, and a slightly bitter finish.
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;A nice sparkling beer with ample fizz and a smooth palate. Hoppy citrus and sharp malt mixed with candy carmel flavors. Red and bubbly, this brew is quite favorable.
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;When my glass was full upon pouring,there was about an inch of amber-colored beer and seven inches of thick tan foam. The cap almost burst from the bottle! A very nice spicy, sweet, floral hops aroma tops this one off. Flavor was lighter than expected, with woody, spicy, floral hops and a light malt backbone. Flavor tended to leave an earthy feel on the tongue, but the individual flavors were pronounced enough to shine through. Finishes quite dry. Overall, solid. I'll have to try more of this brewer's products, preferably when I don't have to purchase a 6-pack!
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;Dark red brown, minimal head. . . thick, murkey hop aroma, almost muddy - one of the more unqiue hoppy aromas I have experienced. Smooth bitter flavour, with some citrus rinds and a bit of malt on the palate. Nice.
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;Very well made, and quite fresh. I have only had a few of this brewery's ales, but this is the best. Alot like an American Strong, yes, but with more hop presence than malt. The malt is a bit sweet, but the hops are earthy and floral all over the place. A gorgeous color, with some unfiltered cloudiness.
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;Brown ale color. Some malt tones, but the hops really dominate both in nose and in taste. Very fresh.
Kraftbrau Rock Harbor Red Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;Deep amber with a thin head, this glass of beer actually has bubbles, unlike most of the beers here. Nose is dominated by cascade hops. Sugary start on the palate which turns all hops. alcohol is present but welcomed. Best from this brewer by far!
Kraftbrau Bent Cedar India Pale Ale;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;IPA;Kraftbrau Brewery;Slightly cloudy dark orange appearance. Fruity, slight hop aroma. Nice smooth, balanced bitter hop tastes. The best Pale that I tasted in Michigan!
Kraftbrau Summer Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub: Clear gold with a white head. Aroma, light malts, some floral and citrus notes. Flavor, pale malts, some citrus, floral notes, not bad.
Kraftbrau Summer Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;One of my favorites from Kraftbrau. Cascade and orange/lemon balances are superb. An excellent thirst quencher (albeit a potent one), and a great summer beer.
Kraftbrau Summer Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Phew...after trying that Bird in the Hand this offering is a relief. Seems like Kraftbrau’s take on Bell’s Two-Hearted Ale (hence, the ""alt"" on the label is a misnomer), with abundant Cascade hops lending pine, grapefruit, lemon, guava, and mango skin aroma and flavor that combines for a quite tropical feel. Has just enough toasty malt balance to keep it eminently drinkable. Kudos, Kraftbrau!"
Kraftbrau Summer Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;RBSG2003 (extended) (On tap at the brewery) Almost clear, straw-colored ale. Small, white, creamy head. The nose is citrusy and yeasty with notes of sweat and leather. Mild, refreshing and nice overall. Very well-balanced flavor. Lightly bitter and grassy with whispers of grapefruit rind. Bone-dry finish with moderate bitterness. Very nice seasonal. If this beer is called Summer Alt, how can it be classified as a Winter Seasonal? Just something to think about.
Kraftbrau Summer Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;Fogged yeast laden peach. Billowy gleaming white foam. Bottle conditioned. Stunningly clean aroma of fresh green leaf, lemon, peaches and cream, white grape, glue, and bready, subtly musty yeast notes. Voluptuous earthy, noble-like hop profile. How can these be Cascades? Underlying crushed oranges, phenols, and tobacco notes. Soft mouthfeel. Lightly prickly carbonation. Candy-dusted malt flavors are paired with delicate leafy, minty hops. Notable bitterness. Soft, dainty tea-like finish alongside mineral notes, tropical fruits, earthy bitterness, peaches, and leather. Could benefit from more malt emphasis, but the yeast is clean and delightful, and the hops are remarkably well placed. It’s overly yeasty and hoppy, and not malty enough to be an Altbier. Imperial Heller Alt de garde? Thanks, Prof.
Kraftbrau Summer Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;"Well, there seems to be deliberate misuse of the Alt label here; this is a pilsernish Ale, or a super malty Kolschish thing with Cascades, but hwatever the hell it is it is certainly refreshing, clean, and well made. Malts do have a bit of sweetness reminiscent of an American Strong, but Paul, do you really think that's the style? It is good!"
Kraftbrau Summer Alt;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Kraftbrau Brewery;Slightly cloudy yellow appearance. Citrusy hop aroma. Quite bitter finish. Nicely balanced. So, the issue is, they call this an Alt and then describe is as a pale ale. hmmm.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;On tap @ the brewpub: Clear copper in color with a white head. Aroma, some fruits, yeast and caramel. Flavor, nutty, caramel, some grassy hops, but overall very malty beer.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Hazy copper amber color, about an inch of tighly packed tan head. Head quickly recedes to a very thin ring. Some spotty lacing, not a whole lot however. Prominent aroma as soon as I twist the cap off the growler. Malt and spicy hop aromas are very nice, but there is a certain something in there that is difficult to identify. The closest thing that comes to mind is kalamata olives. It is strong each time I twist the growler cap for a refill. It is mild in the glass. Nice flavor of malt and spicy hops. There is certainly a lager character to this beer. It is clean and softly carbonated. Aftertaste is more spicy hops and unfortunately that olive taste.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Another ridiculously overcarbonated Kraftbrau lager...I lost a few ounces again. This is a caramel-colored maibock that poured with a thick light tan head. Caramel and alcohol notes in the aroma. Flavor is caramely, somewhat fruity, and musty, with strong bread-like notes and touches of alcohol. Fairly smooth for a maibock, as these tend to be a bit harsh.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Nice cloudy orange to brown wheat looking beer. Nice foamy off white head. I smell apple, caramel, lemon peel perhaps, toffee, malt, & some bitterness. Great smelling for a Kraftbrau beer. Tastes quite light actually, a little bitterness, toffee, slightest bit of alcohol. This is the best beer from Kraftbrau for me so far. Awesome. Too bad its seasonal. Actually after the beer sits for a little bit a foul rotten egg smell has been discovered. Why is it that Kraftbrau beers stink. Hope they aren't using water straight from the Kalamazoo river.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;poured a murky copper color with a massive white head. sweet malt aroma, taste is of mostly sweet caramel malt with some light fruitiness, with a nice bitter finish.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;There's that wacky Kraftbrau nose again. I love it. Flavor is fruity, grassy, malty, sour and bitter all at once. Probably the most bitter maibock I've had, with the possible exception of Einbecker. Thanks, Prof!
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Cloudy copper color. Great white head. Sweet malty flavor with a bitter finish. An interesting beer.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;I'm not a bock fan and this was pretty darn good. Super pronounced malty sweetness (caramel) but immediately tempered by noble hops, flat and bitter. Wonderfully full body but not syrupy.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;A little lighter than I expected a bock to be. And very sweet with a malt flavor I can't quite place. One of my least favorite Kraftbrau offerings lately.
Kraftbrau Maibock;Kalamazoo, Michigan, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Kraftbrau Brewery;Light golden color. Light hoppy, sweet malty aroma. Quite sweet malty finish, a little hops. Probably not a bock considering the golden color.
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from Dick’s brewery pours a murky copper with a big tan head. Aroma is sweet and malty with esters of banana. Taste is sweet and earthy. Banana and raisins. Very earthy with bread like qualities. Not too boozy for 10%. Smooth and I think it’s a little underrated. Great beer!
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear amber color with a moderate white head on it. Nose is quite sweet, with some caramel and rock candy, as well as a fair amount of fruit to it (like figs). Taste is also quite sweet, yet filled with fig flavor as well. OK, but not my sort of thing.
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;12oz bottle purchased at total wine in Lynnwood. Pours a hazy Amber color with a medium sized white head that leaves decent lacing. Smells of grapes, Belgian yeast, pear, clove, and pepper. Tastes of the same things. Mouthfeel is slick and oily with light carbonation and a dry finish. True to the grand cru style. One of the better Dick’s offers as their Belgians.
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;Serving: from bottle--purchased at The Beer Junciton. Aroma: moderate apple aroma. Appearance: very small, off-white, initial head that disappeared in seconds. Fully diminishing longevity and fair lacing. Tiny body particles, and hazy, dark-amber body. Taste: moderately sour, cherry-like initial flavor, and heavily sweet, over-ripe fruit-like finish with long duration. Palate: medium-to-full bodied with oily texture, soft carbonation and lightly alcoholic finish feel. Overall: a very complex and well-brewed beer, but it was too sweet for my tastes and I wouldn’t drink it again.
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;Thin disappearing head. Aroma of raisins,yeast, alcohol, bananas. Tastes the same but with a grapey start and a woody progression. Reminds me of brandy. Enough effervescence to avoid being syrupy but still is sweeeeet.
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;First taste is of grapes and plenty sweet, reminiscent even of a grape soda. Flavors of burnt sugar, yeast, vanilla and cinnamon later. Slightly bitter finish. Quite heavy in the mouth. Elements of an abbey ale are there, alright, but overdone.
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;24 dec 2012, bottle. Pink/brown. Nose is rather like a dry white wine with some soft fruit, maybe bananas. Tastes very alcoholy, raisins, white grapes, some dry oak. It isn't subtle. It's big and brash and I think a bit juvenile. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;355ml bottle pours a light brown color with a small white head that leaves some thin lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild with caramel and yeasty notes. Taste is caramel malty sweet with some spicy hop bitterness and a yeasty dry finish. Medium to heavy body with some nice carbonation. A decent brew but flavors need to be more complex to fit the style better.
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;On tap @ Chuck’s 85th. Pours slightly cloudy orange. Minimal head. Aroma is a hint of fruit and syrupy sweetness. Taste is floral, apple, banana, clove, caramel malt, and funky Belgian finish. Sweetness throughout. Big alcohol that doesn’t hide.
Dick's Grand Cru;Centralia, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dick's Brewing Company;Hazy amber, frothy beige head. Aroma of dark fruit, dough, malt. Taste is sweet dark fruit and Belgian yeast. Pretty good beer. Alcohol was not overwhelming.
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;Young’s Brewing Company--Dick’s Smoked Porter--2002 Release--22 oz. Bottle--7.00% ABV. 3.75 / 5.0) Porter--Clear thin brown bronze color. Ugly sediment. Mild lacy head. Smoky tangy rich toasted hop front. Dry sweet toasted smoky caramel ester fruit flavor. Clean rich estery hot hop end. Weak body. Too much ester. Sampled 12/7/2002.
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;Appears quite light for a porter with a good, loosely-bubbled head and nice lace and a dark malty aroma with notes of caramel. Flavour is that of coffee, roasty and full of toffee with a nutty hop finish. Creamy body with decent carbonation. Pleasant porter - many thanks, G!
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;Found this on tap at a local restuarant. Frothy off white head, dark brown color. Taste was very smokey and sweet with a touch of bitterness. I enjoyed this beer good cold can even handle it after it’s warm.
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is murky dark brown. Aroma is lightly malty (roasted grain), lightly hoppy (resin), with a note of manure. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Everyone knows I like farmy odors in beer, but never have I found one so brutally manure-like. Horse blanket, fine. Horse poop, no thank you. It ruined the aroma for me, and I just couldn’t recover.
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;GArnet under a big, frothy tan head. Aroma was chocolate and coffee and caramel but covered by smoke. Rich and creamy, full-bodied. The flavor held hints of chocolate and coffe and such but was overpowered by the smokiness. Unpleasant.
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;"Oozed out of the bottle after opening. Murky, with an apple cider hue. Smooth carbonation; somewhat light bodied. Chocolate and toast in the malts. Notes of campfire and spicy yeast. Hoppy (grass and a little pine) and curiously aromatic (cow pasture)."
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;Brown. Pleasantly smoky, meaty, grassy, malt accented aroma that shows hints of manure, hay, barnyard and a hint of chocolate. This beer has kept extremely well, considering it is almost 3 years old. Smoky malt flavor with hints of caramel.
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;Malty, roasty aroma with hints of smoke. Color is a dark brown with a small head. Roasty up front with a nice smoked taste that just accellerates into your taste buds. Good finish. Medium body could use some more malt.
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;"Picked up a bottle at the MSM Deli in Tacoma. An old Lava Rock Porter bottle with a Smoked Porter label slapped on. Says ""bottle conditioned 4-18-02."" While cold the aroma is pure alchohol and smoke, enough so my girlfriend refused even to take a sip. It pours a very dark burgandy with good head retention. Flavor reflects the aroma: alcohol, smoke, and some hops for bitterness. As it warms the aroma explodes with caramel, chocolate, molasses, and deeply smoked malts. The bitterness is not all gone, and I wish it were a touch mellower (remarkable considering its age) but this beer turned out to be excellent. Something very strange about this beer is the fact that I could walk away from it for a few minutes and be greeted with that initial overpowering alchohol/smokiness, but a second whiff always yielded the wonderful caramels and chocolates beneath the smoke. With ample patience this beer should make anyone happy."
Dick's Smoked Porter;Centralia, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dick's Brewing Company;Bottled 4/18/02 Huge tan rocky head that sits a top a dark brown/ruby body, definitely not opaque. The head slowly collapses into a creamt tan pillow. Lacing is excellent. This is one of the more fascinating beer heads I have seen. The aroma is smoky, think smoked meats, there is also plenty of sweet malts, mosltly chcoclate and caramel. Big smoky flavor, I mean really smoky, like a rauchbier. The smoke works together in harmony with the sweetness of the malts to form a cohesive whole. A significant amount of bitterness still exists in this 2 1/2 year old beer, most of it is coming from roasted malt and it you know what it works, I mean it is really quite good. Medium bitter palate. Very interesting beer and worthy of my limited luggage space on my trip back from the Pacific NW.
