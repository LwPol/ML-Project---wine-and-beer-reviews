Aroma of vegetables, cardboard and cat piss. Watery, not much malts or hops to talk about, only some cardboardish notes (liquid cardboard?).

Haneda Syuzan Kaido Kölsch;Kyoto-fu Kyoto-shi, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Haneda Sake Brewing Co.;Here’s the Syuzan Kaido Kölsch 5% One of the things these guys did which was a bit different were they had pull top bottle caps - no bottle openers necessary. Pouring a deep gold with a fast dissipating off-white head of foam. The aroma is buttery diacetyl. The taste is crisp light malts & butterscotch with a sharp hoppy bite. I am not sure how appropriate diacetyl is in a Kölsch but this seems a bit much. Interestingly enough the diacetyl fades and crisp malts + hops start to shine. Somewhat below average. Get rid of that diacetyl and it’d be pretty good. I’ve had it on tap and in bottles in much better form than this.
Haneda Syuzan Kaido Kölsch;Kyoto-fu Kyoto-shi, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Haneda Sake Brewing Co.;On tap at CBM Jimbocho. Hazy golden yellow with a small off-white head.

Good stuff from the best Ji-beer brewer in Kyoto. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Paaaaaaale shiny gilded yellow body with no head to speak of. Weak, slightly herbal bready aroma. Weak taste, herbal - nicely so, but vague, a bit eggy too again. Must be the brewery’s signature.

This is now being sold in bombers. Not bad, average bitterness that lasts in the finish, doesn’t have the diacetyl problems of yore, nothing really stands out but it’s a well balanced beer with a stronger malt backing than I’ve come to expect with this brewery.
Saltspring Whale Tail Amber Ale;Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Gulf Islands Brewery (Salt Spring Island Ales);Not a great beer at all, not terrible, I wouldnt buy it again.

Flying Bison Orion Rye;Buffalo, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Flying Bison Brewing;Cask. Golden amber ale with a thin cremay off white head. Sweet caramel aroma with notes of berries. In mouth, a sweet herbal malt, with treacle, lingering hops bitterness. Medium bodied. The Real Beer Expo - Rochester, NY, Oct. 21, 2006.
Flying Bison Orion Rye;Buffalo, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Flying Bison Brewing;(cask @ The Real Beer Expo - Rochester, NY) Amber in color with a thick and puffy tan head. Aroma is rather bland but has some hops in it as well. Flavor has a decent amount of hops and an interesting spicy note, possibly from the rye. Some malts at the end make for a very clean and smooth finish. A very different beer to be sure.
Flying Bison Orion Rye;Buffalo, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Flying Bison Brewing;Draught at the Buffalo Brewfest. Medium amber color with an off white head, not very long lasting. Decent base beer with noticible hops and a medium body. The rye adds a nice little slant on it with a spicier kick. Not bad.
Flying Bison Orion Rye;Buffalo, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Flying Bison Brewing;From a growler purchased at Premier Gourmet: Amber body with a dense white head. Aroma of toasted malts and rye bread. Noticeable hop presence, a hint of citrus and moderate bitterness, but the flavor is mainly toasted malts and rye. Clean and very drinkable like most Flying Bison offerings.
Flying Bison Orion Rye;Buffalo, New York, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Flying Bison Brewing;This was a unique beta test, the base being their solid British style pale ale, and rye added instead of what is often added being wheat. Dark yellow with lots of lace. Significant bitterness and toastiness. The best part - unfiltered. Refreshing, decent carbonation though above average.
Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;bottle. solid roasted flavor and aroma, Fuller mouthfeel, fuller flavor, roasted malts, smooth flavor, probably the best FB to date & its 3 yrs old
Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;In short: A highly roasted porter. Ok How: Bottle 12oz. Exact age unknown. Shared by rudolf The look: Dark brown body toped by a medium beige head In long: The strong nose is very roasted bringing burnt wood and ground pepper notes. Taste mostly highly roasted (read “burnt”) malts. Also some burnt caramel, notes of molasses. Finish is dry-ish. That’s all I had on this beer. A very roasted beer is good at covering any problems and feeling a bit dry. And that’s what this beer is was all about. That was my last rate of BCTC. Many more beers ensued but it becomes a bit blurry. I would like use this last BCTC rating to observe a moment of silence for all the innocent brain cells that died during that weekend.
Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;Pre-release sample bottle from goldtwins. Dark as hell with a thin wispy light brown head. Aroma is milk chocolate and dark fruits. Flavor has some sweet dark fruits, chocolate and some molasses. Mouthfeel is full and damn creamy. Thanks Larry, this is a tasty treat.
Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;Many thanks to Steve for dropping this American Strong Ale.. er.. Porter at my house! Poured not much deeper than medium brown with a light dusting of white head.. not lively in the least. The aroma was rich, dark, and malty with molasses, vegemite, and a bouquet of darker fruits present.. alcohol warmth-infused sweetness on the back of the nose that worked very well. This slid slowly onto the palate due to low carbonation, and the warm dark malts covered the taste buds well.. molasses was dominant with lesser aged caramel and again a dose of vegemite.. bitterness was light and herbal-inspired.. sweet finish with the aforementioned dark malts and some alcohol warmth. Medium-plus bodied with virtually no carbonation on the palate.. alcohol was well-masked and served only to amplify the sweetness in here.. warmer malty finish picked up some greener pine notes. Nice one!
Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;Thanks to richlikebeer, Nice aroma of roasted malts, sweet-chocolate with a roasted malt, molasses taste. Very nice beer.
Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;12oz bottle with a ’plain’ and generic looking white label with black text.

Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;Thanks to Rudolf. Black pour, medium beige head that last. Aroma is sweet with lots of chocolate and roastiness and some fruitiness to it. Flavor is chocolate, mollasses, roasted malt and even a touch of espresso in the end. After is sweet and sugary with a touch of anice and the alcohol definitely plays a role. Medium mouthfeel and lots of carbonation with a cloying sweetness that really sticks to your mouth. This is damn good and is definitely an imperial porter bordering stout. Lots of heavy flavor but a sweet chocolate flvor is dominate with a cloying sweet roastiness.
Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;12 oz bottle via Homebrew Mystery Swap (thanks Rudolf!). Bottle has a generic sticker and says ’R&D prototype’... This beer pours a dark brown/black with a huge chunky beige head. Nose is malty with some mild fruity esters and subtle roastiness. Taste starts very sweet and then suddenly turns in an espresso delight with a bit of chocolate and vanilla in the mix. The espresso continues long into the aftertaste, bordering on ashy. There is a bit of smokiness in there as well as some fusel alcohol. Body is light/medium, carbonation is high. This borders on somewhere between a scottish wee heavy and a Robust porter as far as style goes.This is quite tasty and i wish i had another.
Flying Bison Imperial Porter;Buffalo, New York, United States;Porter - Imperial;Flying Bison Brewing;Thank you Rudolph. Pours black with a small head and w white halo lacing. Aroma is strong with what has come to be a standard American strong maltiness and alcohol (or what I like to rum cake). So it’s nicely rich but also alcoholic. Taste is also sweet with an oatmeal-like flavor which is offset by an equally strong alcoholic cherry and whiskey. A medium body with a really light aftertaste.12oz bottle with a home printed label, Rodenbach Grand Cru smaller tulip glass.
Pearl Street Harbor Master ESB;Buffalo, New York, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);C hop aroma. Grapefruity initial taste, and then the more acidic rind, then settling into malt. Lace. Quaffable.
Castle Rock St Johns Wort;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Cask, handpump @ the Rook & Gaskill, York, Nth Yorkshire. Slightly oily looking and still, medium, orange gold body with a thick, creamy off-white head that legged and frosted wildly down the glass. Feint aroma of herbal tea, almost like chamomile mixed with St. John’s wort, with a dash of pale honey stirred in. Sour lemon, spruce and well defined herbal and calming St. John’s wort flavours kick it off in the first mouthful. Touch of orange marmalade and toasted malt builds the palate as it goes and it’s soft and creamy texture feels wonderful on the tongue. Becomes quite sweet, honeyish yet its reasonably dry and spicy on the swallow. The citrus and herbal notes are beautifully defined, the body is firm and it crosses the mouth with such rampant ease. This wasn’t bad. I’m a closet junkie for St. John’s wort tea and in this beer it did it huge favours as far as depth and balance. Very tasty, refreshing and quaffable. Nice!!!

I’m not a big amber ale fan, but this one satiisfied. The aroma is malty, toffee, caramel, and bit of butterscotch with skinned apples and a hint of berries.

Augusta Farmhouse Saison;Washington, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Augusta Brewing Company;"750 c&c from Bu11zeye. Pours hazy orange amber with a slight head. Aroma is fruity, but with a dark malt suggesting contact with wood. Med body. Very light carbonation. Flavor is arguably a bit oxidized, which may be where the wood suggestion comes from. It’s very lightly spicy, has some fruit esters, but overall its very dark. It’s not quite dry in the finish, a bit fruity, and still seems to have a woody component. It’s actually reminding me of some of the Fuller’s Vintage Old Ales. For which, among other reasons, I’m rather liking it. ""rerate"": After looking at other ratings, I’m thinking my 750 is rather like that of Zymurgeist2."
Augusta Farmhouse Saison;Washington, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Augusta Brewing Company;Batch 10 Tasted on 6/17/13 from a corked and caged 750mL bottle purchased at Wine and Cheese Place. Pours hazy lightly burnt orange with a very thick and rocky cream colored head that slowly recedes to rocky lace. The nose features a bit more caramel and bread malt than I am used to from a Saison, but there is a nice spicy Saison yeast character as well. The flavor is pretty much the same, with a nice spicy Saison character, but it is a little more malty with caramel then I like in a Saison. The body is medium with lively carbonation and a long caramel malty and spicy Saison yeast finish.
Augusta Farmhouse Saison;Washington, Missouri, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Augusta Brewing Company;Spicy aroma from the yeast was promising, but it all went down hill from there.

Pours an orangish gold with a big fluffy head and aromas of blegian yeast, grass and a little bit of lemon or funk.

Linde-Huusbier;Zürich, Switzerland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Linde-Oberstrass;Sampled draft @ Linde-Oberstrass as supposedly Linde-Oberstrass Pils. Orange sparkling creamy white head. Nose is butter to the max in the worst way. Taste is pure awful sweet carbonated butter to the max. Total garbage. The other ratings are less harsh, bad batch, we were served this.
Linde-Huusbier;Zürich, Switzerland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Linde-Oberstrass;Tap at the brewpub. Golden summer nose, some candy and honey. Decent bitterness over lively carbonation, highly quaffable. Short and surprisingly dry finish. Highly recommended!
Linde-Huusbier;Zürich, Switzerland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Linde-Oberstrass;cloudy golden color, definitely unfiltered. Massively malty nose of freshly baked toasted malts. Lovely toasty notes in the mouth. Lingering grainy finish. Very malt accented. Refreshing, but needs more hops or increased sweetness. Still a decent Hellas.

Linde-Huusbier;Zürich, Switzerland;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Linde-Oberstrass;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy orange color. Delicate but quite nice hoppy aroma. The taste has some fresh fruitness, followed by a medium hop impact with some qualities; unfortunately, almost immediately, the body reveals to be very weak, with an extreme poor and short final; at least, the malt is missing, only some hop oils are left."

Linde Altbier;Zürich, Switzerland;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Linde-Oberstrass;"Draught@brewpub, Zürich My notes say: ""Huusbier Dunkel"", I am not sure if this is their ""Altbier"" or not (website says about altbier that it is ""Ein fein-herbes, kräftiges Dunkel-Bier""). Dark nut brown color, decent beige head. Unclean toffee and cold coffee in the nose. Milk coffee flavor with some coffee beans and chocolate. Flavors fade away quickly. Their tastiest beer, but this one is not real gem either."
Linde Altbier;Zürich, Switzerland;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Linde-Oberstrass;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy dark amber color with a red hue; creamy head, with the foam sticking on the glass. Very light aroma of roasted malt. The body is just one notch above the Huusbier’s, but still not sufficient, with light flavor of sugar and burnt sugar (more bitter than ordinary caramel). In the end the bitterness given by the roasted malt and hop is disturbing, lost in the sea without malt support. I think they have a problem with the malt here… I got information from the waitress that some of the beers are still brewed at Back & Brau (ancient owner of the premises), as they still use their beermats."

Hürlimann Hammer;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);Bottled 33cl. It pours a faintly hazy beer with a fast diminishing white head. Fizzy. Some apple juice in the nose. The taste is rather sweet. Some candy showing up. Poor mouthfeel. Watery and metallic with a hint of chestnuts and mushrooms. The alcohol is too present. Musty. Lime and lemon in the finish. A awful lager.

Kern River Class V Stout;Kernville, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Kern River Brewing;"Got as a gift from RaulMondesi. 22 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toasted dark/brown bread, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of smoke, charcoal, vanilla, cream, toffee, molasses, dark fruit, citrus, pepper, pine, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of black/roast/bready malts and light-moderate citrus/pine hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toasted dark/brown bread, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of smoke, charcoal, vanilla, cream, toffee, molasses, dark fruit, citrus, pepper, pine, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate roast/char and pepper/piney/citrus peel hop bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, toasted dark/brown bread, nuttiness, smoke, char, citrus, pepper, pine, light molasses/dark fruit, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of black/roast/bready malts and light-moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; with an awesome roast/hop bitter/sweet balance; and zero acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from hop/char bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol for 8.5%. Overall this is an incredible imperial stout! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of black/roast/bready malts and light-moderate citrus/pine hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the mellowly bitter/drying finish. For an American style imperial stout, this does everything perfectly. Very rich and complex malts with supporting American C hops, without overwhelming the malt profile. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example."

Kern River Sequoia Red;Kernville, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kern River Brewing;Appearance is brownish red with a nice head, bit thin.

Kern River Sequoia Red;Kernville, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kern River Brewing;My Bottom Line: This balanced and cushy Red Ale aligns subtle caramel malts and wooden hops into a cohesive whole which is perfect to attract neophytes into the world of real (craft) beer. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam tops the cloudy dark red. -The caramel malt character nears chocolate. -This mouthfeel is yet another wonder from Kern River which feels nourishing yet really easy to drink. -The flavour profile may be tame, but this remains as competently crafted as any other Kern River brew I’ve had. On tap at the brewpub.
Great Lakes Brewery Devils Pale Ale 666;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);Pours a large frothy beige head and has a murky, dark amber appearance. Looks like dirty rusty water, devil's pale ale it seems. Has aromas of earthy hops and nutty malts. Flavours seem to have a bit of toffee and light chocolate hints but mainly some bitter type earthy hops. Also some hints of toasty malts. Medium bodied. Average retention. Fairly smooth sensation and slightly astringent on the palate. Pretty good stuff.
Great Lakes Brewery Devils Pale Ale 666;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);"Apparently, I've been living under a rock and only just emerged. This has been around for quite a while now, but I guess I haven't had it offered on tap before—let alone cask. (Nor have I picked it up at the LCBO, if I've seen it there.) I just had it for the first time, and it kind of blew my mind. It's a combination of things I didn't expect. At the start of every sip, I thought, ""No, I don't think I like ...,"" and by the time I was done, I was thinking, ""Oh, this is great!"" It's a unique, addictive mix of different styles. If I closed my eyes, I would describe it as an aggressively hopped English ESB (which is a contradiction) that leans more to its ale side in hindsight. (By the way, this beer is not at all pale. I've been told that this darker colour is typical of so-called pale ales in England—even if not here.) It starts off as if it's going to be one of those ""hop bomb"" beers (too common among the widely diverse IPAs and pale ales in North America) that sacrifices flavour purely for dramatic effect. But as it's on your tongue, it quickly morphs and mellows out into an example of an English ale. As such, there is no single point in time during which you can taste this beer as a whole. You simply have to put up with its chameleon character. I'm not too fond of how it starts off, but I very much like how it ends. It was unique in my experience in that I always started off thinking I disliked it, but ended up thinking it was great. Perhaps it's similar to a massage—the pain during treatment is something you have to put up with in order to feel good afterwards."
Great Lakes Brewery Devils Pale Ale 666;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);One of the best brews from this location. Lots and lots of malt flavor and hop bite. Result is a nice westcoast style IPA like beer with more malt. Nice head.

Thanks guys. Pours a lime green colour with no head or carbonation. Seriously, this is the first time I’ve come across something legitimately green in colour. The aroma is just not good. Beansprouts, booze, minor honey, not at all inviting. Borderline revolting. Flavour is awful, though I can almost detect some honey comb in there. Way too sweet, way too boozy, and kind of reminds me of wax. Bees wax. The earth behind Matt’s house is now stained with a poison which will prohibit the growth of grass for the next few decades.

Church-Key Riders of the Purple Loosestrife;Campbellford, Ontario, Canada;Mead;Church-Key Brewing;Cask. At Volo Cask Days 2008. this rating has eluded me for a long time - and now I get it on cask!

Trafalgar Korruptor;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;200 ml bottle from Garthicus. Nose of honeycomb, the sweetness of candi sugar, and some light apple notes. Clear rust with a very few bubbles. Flavor is sweet honey with some golden raisins, and actually only a tiny bit of alcohol. finish slightly sweet honey! Duh! another mead, maybe! Pretty decent if it’s a mead. Pretty poor Barleywine!
Trafalgar Korruptor;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;200mL bottle from the X-Mas giftpacks that for no apparent reason just showed up at my LCBO, ’seasonably late’ I guess. The word ’bizarre’ doesn’t begin to describe this beer-like substance. They obviously spent a FORTUNE on the packaging of this product, the label on the tiny clear-glass bottle being a peice of cardboard that was obviously cut out by hand. Oh but it doesn’t stop there. In the bottle, it’s a pale gold colour, upon pouring, IT CHANGES COLOUR! I s*** you not, turns a darker amber-gold hybrid colour with surprising carbonation. Wow. Smells, odd. Booze, cardboard, pen ink, Chrystal malts, and a single hop bud getting the crap beat out of it by the booze. Flavour is, UUUUHHHHHGGGGGG. That is the adjective I have chosen. This might be the single sweetest ’beer’ I’ve ever come across. Holy crap. Unbe-f***ing-lievably sweet malt body with some Earthy hops in the finish. There might be more in there but I’m too busy picking up my teeth off the floor that fell rotted out due to the sugar content to notice or care. This product is f***ing insane. Why? And now all that carbonation suddenly disappeared? What? Absolutely undrinkable. It’s like a trip to the dentist. What an insane and probably unneccessary experience. I might have just lost a piece of myself that I’ll never get back (and it’s not just my teeth).

Trafalgar Korruptor;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Pours a mostly still transparent copper amber and some legs. Aroma of sweet dark honey and fruity berry notes with a touch of lavender. Starts with a rich sugary malty sweetness and a touch of raisins and dark berries before a lightly warming finish. A pretty decent mead (mislabeled as a barleywine).
Trafalgar Korruptor;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"200 ml bottle from an LCBO gift pack. wow these were weird beers. this offering pours a simple still amber. no carbonation at all. the aroma is very sweet. very much a watered down malt extract aroma with an apple note thrown in. the flavour is also quite sweet. there is just nothing to help the sweetness at all. this sample came back lab tested by the LCBO at 14% but there is so much residual sugar that im sure with the proper yeast strain this could have reach ~20% ABV. not that it would have made this beer any better, im just trying to impart on anyone who is reading this just how sweet the ""finished"" product was. i just dont know what to make of this brewery and im truely surprised to see it remain in business and hold the shelf space it does at the LCBO."
Trafalgar Korruptor;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottled sample. Amber in colour with moderate carbonation. Aromas of stale pale malts, earthy hops, and chemicals. Some hop flavor, but the thinned out caramel malt and earthy/dirty water notes are strongest. The chemical astringency along with a thin body make for a poor drinking experience. Not good at all.
Trafalgar Korruptor;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Clear amber w/ a few gray bubbles. Sweet aroma w/ some fusel notes. syrupy feel. Sweet flavour of caramel & brown sugar w/ an extremely intense, malt liquor-like alcohol presence.
Trafalgar Korruptor;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;200 ml bottle- Deep brown liquid letting some light in, pours an off white one finger of foam. Nose is very strong spices and port wine with licorice and deep rooted Belgian candy sugar and wine gums. Lots of booze too. Tastes of sweet port wine with clove and peat. Mid way, there is very sweet alcoholic Belgian candy sugar and caramel leading to a very big and boozey sweet malt finish. This is a sipper, but I enjoyed the time I spent sipping on it.
Trafalgar Korruptor;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"I feel kind of funny drinking a beer called Korruptor with biohazard signs all over the label; is this okay??? Dark brown golden colour with no head and no lacing. Aroma is thick with caramel malts and nothing else that is all to discerning, and over fermented yeast like a roasted hunk of wheat bread. Flavour is thick with alcohol and caramel malts. Palate is thick like syrup. I won’t be wanting this anymore unless someone gives it to me."

John Harvard's Cambridge The Bards Best Bitter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;On cask at the brewpub - Cambridge, MA. Surprisingly dark and the flavor shows too. More like a southern English Brown or a Dark Mild, in my opinion. Varied roasted flavors and not enough snappy hop bite to balance out. Drinkable, otherwise.
John Harvard's Cambridge The Bards Best Bitter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Sampled @ John Harvards Brewhouse with the Mad_Indian. Pours amber with an aveage size off-white head. Aroma of caramel, toffee, and hops. The flavor is slightly sweet caramel with traces of bitterness through out. Nothing special.
John Harvard's Cambridge The Bards Best Bitter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Sampled with Stegosaurus during our second Boston Tour. Served at John Harvards brewing. Amber pour with a caramel and mild hop aroma. A little bitter at first with hints of a hop taste. Watery and thin for me.

John Harvard's Cambridge The Bards Best Bitter;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse Cambridge;Draught pint at JH Cambridge, 8/11/06. Somewhat fluffy, white head is retained at cover, atop a peanut colored amber-bronze. High clarity with a good deal of bubbles in the liquid. Moderate amount of lacing in rings, proceeds down the glass. Rubbery/leathery, very dry yeast-like notes emanate from the liquid. Not a very strong aroma, and somewhat bolstered by some dusty, straw/dry-grass-like hoppiness. A touch of buttercream, earth, dirt and more of the rubberiness, on the end. Not sure what to make of it. It’s not overly sweet or dry, dosent really impress much malt or real English notes on the nose. The flavor contains the rubbery aspect. It’s not autolyzed yeast or anything nearly that bad, just sort of an old, dry hoppiness, or like artificial turf smells. Some definite nuttiness, clean, pale malt sugars and more straw-like notes. Not watery, at all, with a pretty substantial, minimally creamy texture, but there seems to be far more texture than flavor. Certainly nothing lively or even very interesting/complex. No alcohol noted, carbonation is moderate.
Karuizawa Kogen Seasonal Scottish Ale 2006 / 2013;Nagano, Japan;Scottish Ale;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;No head. Dark brown color. Nose is earthy with hints of whiskey, Halloween candy. Malty mouth with much more caramel, chocolate and whiskey notes. Can’t say its overly complex but not bad (this is 2006 release)
Karuizawa Kogen Seasonal Scottish Ale 2006 / 2013;Nagano, Japan;Scottish Ale;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;Backlog rating. Can at Chriso’s tasting May 2014. It pours an amber color with a small white head. Aroma is sweet and malty, with notes of toffee, ripe apricots, orange marmalade. Taste is similarly sweet with a lightly tangy finish with small notes of alcohol. Toffee, caramel, molasses, more ripe fruits. Quite light in body with soft carbonation. Overall, not extremely bad but definitely too sweet for me

Pours amber, thin white head, sweet orange aroma, taste presents hoppy caramel, overripe fruits, apricot, malts. An interesting taste but not sure I could stomach a few cans of it.
Karuizawa Kogen Seasonal Scottish Ale 2006 / 2013;Nagano, Japan;Scottish Ale;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;2013 can @ Chriso. It pours clear amber with a medium yellow-white head. The nose is musty, sweet, sticky, caramel and orange sponge cake. The taste is toasty, orange sponge cake, candied peel, muffin, earthy, toast, hay, sherbet and icing sugar with a dry finish. Light-medium body and fine carbonation. A bit sweet and one-dimensional. Not for me....
Karuizawa Kogen Seasonal Scottish Ale 2006 / 2013;Nagano, Japan;Scottish Ale;Yo-Ho Brewing Company;(2013 version) Caramel malt aroma. Sweet caramel flavor, plum, raisin, smokey finish. Fairly decent Scottish ale, even though the dry alcool slowly overtakes the caramel sweetness.

Medium brown with a low head. Malty, smoky flavor, caramel, peat, peaches, orange. Interesting. Doesn’t all mesh so well, but still nice. Somewhat sweet, but still balanced.
Buckner Nut Brown;Cape Girardeau, Missouri, United States;Brown Ale;Buckner's Brewing Company;Good color from a traditional English brown ale -- not too dark or murky. Sweet chocolate and hazelnut aromas. The bittering punch from English hops slides into a rougher texture, dominated by bitter chocolate notes and faint citrus. Kind of a mixed bag, but quenching on the finish and balanced throughout.
Aksarben Raspberry Wheat;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Aksarben Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours light amber with an off-white head. The strong raspberry aroma is quite pronounced. You get a raspberry flavor at first, then a mild tartness that whimpers away without much of anything. Great aroma, though.
Aksarben Czech Pilsner;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Aksarben Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a hazy dark gold with a poofy slightly off-white head. Good flavoring bitterness immediately, but is a bit too dark in color and has an unusual amount of sweetness for the style. Has a nice bitter drying finish of Saaz (?) hops. In spite of the style discrepancies, this is a very refreshing and tasty beer.
Aksarben Hefeweizen;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Aksarben Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a dark copper with a dirty white head. Aroma was great: Belgian yeast, spices, banana, and clove. Banana, clove, and belgian yeast make up the solid flavor profile of this one. Good body for the style.
Aksarben Hefeweizen;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Aksarben Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a murky light prown baby poop color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is AWESOME! very strong banana aroma at first, but as it warms, I actually get pronounced mustard aromas. Flavor has a yummy tartness with really good sweetness as well. The esters are rich and can tasted as delicious banana. The honey mustard dressing flavor emerges at warming as well. This is a nice beer. The only drawback is the dark color for a non-dunkel.
Platte Valley Red Rock Wheat;Kearney, Nebraska, United States;Wheat Ale;Platte Valley Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a hazy orange-amber with a fleeting white head. The beer is somewhat flat. I detect a mild berry flavor as well as the pronounced wheat taste. This beer lacks the typical Platte Valley Brewing thickness or body. It seems to need more of everything. As close to dishwater as you will ever be served at this otherwise outstanding brewpub. Best part about the beer was the warmer serving temperature. UPDATE 9/13/7: On tap at the brewpub. A way better beer than my previous score of 1.9, I must say. Thin white head, intense orange aroma. Smooth mellow fruity flavor of oranges and coriander. Very toasted malt flavor makes this a good drinker.

AleWerks Inaugural Tavern Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to maniac’s generosity! Pours dark cola/chocolate brown with a medium head that reduces a bit but isn’t in a hurry. Dark fruit/raisin aroma is very strong, with some toffee and chocolate. Taste is very strong chocolate with some graininess and alcohol. Damn, this is good. Funny that this beer goes seven and a half months with no ratings and then suddenly gets three ratings in three consecutive days!
AleWerks Inaugural Tavern Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;05/21/08 side by side comp with 2007 Tavern Ale. Very dark mahogony. Big raisin plum and coffee aroma over rich sweetness. Plums raisins and molasses flavors with some coffee. Surprizingly light mouthfeeel with some cholate and coffee in the finish. Bit thin for all the roasty stuff and maybe a touch of oxidation? Overall quite delicious. I liked this much better than the subsequent release. Thanks to either Butters or Maniac for getting this.
AleWerks Inaugural Tavern Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;Pours much darker brown and with almost no head. Wonderful chocolate, coffee, roasty tasting and aroma notes. Definitely fits to be a porter more than a brown. Creamy mouthfeel. Of the two, this one is far superior.

AleWerks Inaugural Tavern Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;Theres a lot wrong with this beer. Near black pour (especially for a brown), with a weird, chewy, marshmallowy vegetal aroma. 3 day old bubblegum comes to mind. A bit of caramel in there. Taste is oddly minty, acetic caramel and more off vegetal flavors. Not digging this.

AleWerks Inaugural Tavern Ale;Williamsburg, Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;AleWerks Brewing Company;Bottle... RBSG 07... Pitch black ale (ok, burnt orange when held up to very bright light) with a small, creamy, beige head. Decent retention. Aroma is pure chocolate! Flavor is a touch tangy (probably from oxidation), lightly sweet and chocolaty with a splash of coffee. Medium to full-bodied and velvety with moderate carbonation. Finishes lightly tangy, mildly bitter and very dry. More like a porter than a brown ale. Very good stuff!

Lagunitas Freak Out;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);I had this in the basement fridge for a very long time. Finally brought it out. It was quite chunky (floaties), which wasn’t ideal, but the aging suited this well, giving it a nice vintage flavor to match what appeared to be a rounded Imperial IPA sensibility. Decent, and a good value at its original price (under $5 for a bomber).

The color is a pleasant golden shade, with quite a bit of carbonation and a decent little amount of head. Leaves a nice little bit of lacing on the rim of the glass. The smell is a sweet hoppy aroma. Has a sort of wood scent to it, like a Christmas tree almost. Very interesting and unusual aroma, slightly bitter. The taste is a burst of hops, with that same woodsy flavor. Like walking through the forest. The hops are bitter, but somewhat offset by that unusual tree-like flavor. Very different IPA, really stands out from the others. Distinct. Has a smooth ale feel to it, but the strong hops give it a jagged edge. It’s a really unique beer, and delicious. This 22 might be hard to swallow down, just because of it’s hoppy/woodsy one-two punch, but I’m gonna try. Truly a one-of-a-kind IPA.
Lagunitas Freak Out;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Bottle pours light copper and orange with a nice fluffy off white head. Slightly stale hop aroma with some toffee and caramel notes. Crisp hop bitterness which is not unlike the rest of Lagunitas. Citrus bitterness with a sweet backbone. Almost drying on the tongue. No discernible flavors to match the sweetness. Not much backing up the bitterness. Watery mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but more of an APA. I hope that its age is why the bitterness has dropped out. Wish I would have drank it sooner.

Lagunitas Freak Out;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Tried at toncatcher’s T3 tasting. Bottle from who else lagunitasfan. Amber yellow color. Lightly hoppy. Easy to drink. Good pizza beer.
Lagunitas Freak Out;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Bottle awesome artwork reminds me of posters my uncle had when i was a kid. Pours a golden body with an off white head. Grassy peach with a light dried fruit, caramel notes and a light warming. Pine with a hint of lemon. Nice.
Lagunitas Freak Out;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);"First off, I really enjoyed the Zappa tribute on the label; certainly took me back to the late sixties. This poured a fairly cloudy and dark gold colour underneath a foamy white two-fingered head. The aroma was a nice combination of hops and malt. The taste was much more of hops than malt, with the right amount of bitterness. Mouthfeel was okay, but I did think it was bit on the ’gritty’ side. Finish was a bit on the sweet side; not bad and overall better than I expected, given some of the slagging that Lagunitas beers have taken on another site."
Lagunitas Freak Out;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);***review from June 18, 2007*** Nice apricot colour with some opaqueness, light carbonation and an average sized offwhite rocky head. So-so retention but suprisingly good bubbly lacing. The aroma is excellent with its aromatic sweet candy grapefruit hops (quite candy-like), canned peaches and lichi nuts and a hint of flowery yumness - one of the better smelling Lagunitas brews. It has a good fresh flavour. Noticable floral hops (?) - very bitter! Yum yum! Some malt and a slight peppermint taste is also detected. I can’t directly taste the alcohol but it’s there. Even though it does taste pretty good it still falls short on interest. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with an excellent bitter finish.
Lagunitas Freak Out;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);"Beer pours a bright hazy brow when held up the light it appears to be bronze in color a off white fluffy head was produced that had some pretty good retention, this beer looks yummy. Very hoppy aroma as to be expected, grape fruit hops and a caramel malt back bone are making my mouth drool, can’t wait for the first sip. Brew starts off sweet and then finished with a dry bitterness, lots of citusy hops that are almost candy sweet, and a malt flavor that reminds me of leather (in a good way) I would have not say the after taste is tart and I’ve never had that before. This is highly enjoyable it’s pretty much a standard IPA but this is a very high quality one that is well balanced. Review done while watching Canada’s worst handy man."""
J.W. Lees Export Ale;Middleton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;J.W. Lees;275ml bottle from Shropshire. Vintage 1989. Slight hiss of carbonation. Pours a clear glowing toffee colour. Cardboard nose from the poor abused hops, but the malt is fine, fragrant, and toffee flavoured. A reasonably firm mouthfeel. The palate is clean and pleasant. Some Indian tea in the finish, and some tobacco in the middle. This is an enjoyable and pleasant experience. Very good.
White Winter Hard Pear Cider;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Perry;White Winter Winery;12oz Bottle. Could this get any lighter? Super-pale yellow-hinted straw color, with no head. Aroma is a distant pear hint, minimal. Flavors are mucky. Rotty-flavored pear flesh, with more stickiness than I expect based on the last hard cider from White Winter. Some glue-like flavors. Little flavor density or texture overall, a bit tart, in a somehow fake-feeling way. Not that good.
White Winter Hard Pear Cider;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Perry;White Winter Winery;Completely clear. Smells like a combo of pear and lemon-lime soda. Flavor is sugared hell in a glass. Acidic, tart, and syrupy rotting fruit. Being awful.
White Winter Hard Pear Cider;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Perry;White Winter Winery;"Props to Skyview on bringing the best and the worst to the tasting. Clear ""color"" with no head. The aroma kind of smells like pear, but with a dash of rubbing alcohol. Oh sweet merciful god... the taste... the horror... It tastes like rubber cement that’s gone bad."
White Winter Hard Pear Cider;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Perry;White Winter Winery;Oh, this *is* really bad. No greater insult to the maker than is otherwise expected with a low rating, but this had notes of fusel alcohol and chemical additives. Very light color. At least the aroma isn’t completely awful.
White Winter Hard Pear Cider;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Perry;White Winter Winery;Pear smell on a horrible product. Chemicals and alcohol. On par with their other ciders. Their mead on the otherhand, fantastic.
White Winter Hard Pear Cider;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Perry;White Winter Winery;"White winter makes great products. Except for this. I like cider, but this one is terrible. It has an unpleasant aroma of alcohol and chemicals. a complete failure. I will have to try another bottle; maybe something went wrong."
White Winter Hard Pear Cider;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Perry;White Winter Winery;From a 12-oz bottle shared at JK’s Sprint Gathering, pours a near clear watery cider with some fizz at the top. Aroma is sweet pear syrup and some enriched white bread. Taste... oooph, a bit watery, flat mineral and ground dirt. A bit rough on the palate for my liking. Strongly recommend serving this below 37 degrees if this suits your taste.
White Winter Hard Pear Cider;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Perry;White Winter Winery;"12 oz bottle purchased at White Winter (July 2006) and sampled from a White Winter glass, a bit above fridge temperature. Very pale, almost clear yellow-gold with just a touch of fizzy bubbling....quite sweet pear-syrupy nose with a nice hint of earthy, chalky character....medium-dry flavor profile, somewhat mineralic towards the finish, touch watery but quite juicy and tasty....lower carbonation, more ""natural"" mouthfeel than the apple cider, I think. This is, interesting, made entirely from pears, rather uncommon for a commercial American perry."
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;pours a creamy orange, fluffy fluffy off white head, very thick lace. nose of malt and floral and citric hops. flavor of creamy caramel, sweet malt, and a bitter note. medium bodied, bitter finish. a good looking and flavorful beer. i brought a growler home from the brewpub.
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;Old rate. Pours a clear orange/amber, head is thick and persistent. Aroma has caramel, dark fruit, some floral and citrus hops. Thick mouthfeel, boozy. Flavour is very assertively hoppy and lingering...is this an IIPA or a BW? The line here is a bit blurred but I think it lends itself more to the prior and less to the later. Still, decent.
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;Amber pour with white head and lace. Aroma of light dried fruit and some resin maybe molasses. Sweet brown sugar, light caramel, and some bread. Medium full bodied beer with light carbonation. Very nice winter warmer.
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;Pours amber with an off-white head. Bitter with some sweetness. Aromas of caramel and milk chocolate. Almost no aromas hops but lots of bittering hops. Hints of nuts and slightly toasted malts.
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;"Pours deep amber with stark white head, aroma is big citrusy hops complemented by a big blast of caramel and biscuit. Thought this was a IIPA as well, but upon seeing it as a barleywine it fits more true to style. Citrus, candied orange and tangerine up front lead into a big overpowering malt middle with caramel and biscuit, and finishes bitter. Pretty good, but for a ""hopwine"" I expected more hop character."
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;Upon ordering this, I was under the impression that it was an IIPA. Now seeing that its a BW, my following notes make a bit more sense: This is a malt bomb, with a prominent soy quality in both the aroma and flavor. I am really anti-soy in beer. The alcohol definitely shines through quite a bit too. A nice appearance and full bodied mouth feel, but not good enough to compensate for the soy in the flavor. The most annoying part about this beer is its misleading name and label. Maybe they put a bunch of hops in here, but its all pretty relative when they put sooo much malt and left so many residual sugars to completely outweigh whatever hops they did include. For me, this is an example of a beer over done.
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;Draft @ Smallbar Wicker Park, Chicago, IL. Pours an amber color with a small off-white head. Has a fruity malty dark fruit aroma with hoppy hints. Fruity malty hoppy flavor with hints of caramel and dark fruit. Has a sweetish malty hoppy finish with some bitterness and some hints of caramel in the aftertaste.
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;Cloudy amber, No Head but some lacing, plenty of hops and cotten candy odor. tastes quite sweet with molasses. Hops are dominated. Quite a nice effort with wheat though.
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;"Enjoyed via draft in a whiskey snifter. The beer pours a relatively light amber color, with a just-off-white head. The aroma brings strong malt characters, with an especially prevalent nod going to Munich malt. The beer smells almost like a Great Lakes Elliot Ness on steroids. I was surpised, however, by the lack of hop aroma and character throughout the beer. The palate was similar to the nose; strongly malt-centric. Again, a lot of continental character malt makes its presence known. Hops do provide a noticeable bitterness to the beer, but it is ultimatley drowned out by the aforementioned malt sweetness. The finish is fairly clean, and contains a surprisingly subtle note of alcohol. Ultimatley, a well-made, if slightly confusingly advertised, strong ale."
New Holland Existential Hopwine;Holland, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Holland Brewing Company;11th October 2008. GABF. Clear gold beer. Aromatic hops nose. A full on barleywine but with an unusual floralness about it. Unusually intense flavour.

Appearance: slightly hazy brown with medium sized cream head. Aroma: bourbon, date, dried dark fruits, fig, caramel, some molasse and a metallic hint. Taste: high sweetness and pretty high bitterness. Notes of bourbon, malty sweet, dried fruits, raisins, caramel and also a metallic note, but not unpleasant.

Central Waters Brewer's Reserve Bourbon Barrel Scotch Ale;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Central Waters Brewing Co.;I'm surprised this beer gets such high ratings. The bottle I tasted was pretty rough. Copper colour with weak beige foam. Aroma a little better than flavour, but both super-boozy in a hot, fusel alcohol way. Bourbon barrel aspects were too heavy-handed: overpowering vanillins, oak tannins, mushy oxidation. Perhaps this was once a nice malty, caramelly Scotch ale base, but it's barely palatable now.

Indi Pilsner;Mindarie, Australia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;"Ahhh, it is but that sweet time of year again where big glass tankards come out and the beer takes a little longer to pour, but goes down in double-time - yes, Oktoberfest!!!. Lunch here at the Brewhaus, a Bavarian dish and this beside all glistening in the midday sun. It shimmers the clearest yellow-gold, nice even and fine streams of bubbles making their way up to burst to life in the form of a condensed pad of snow that laces intricately. It’s aroma a heady mix of gritty, haystack and dusty malts, floral hops and just a touch fresh baked, warm white bread; sultry!!! Big, yet small, rampaging, yet softer than a brush with a feather is the palate. Very clean, broad toasted malts and gritty pale grains dance with tangy, slightly sour malt and hops in back with a good infusion of peppery spices and fresh herbs throughout. The swallow so neat and tight, remains crisp, clean, floral with just a touch of late pilsner malt as it sinks down into darkness. Its front has a subtle sweetness, the very rear a moderate bitterness that flows with the flavour, a lovely linger of palest Summer grains and floral, zesty hops are left well melded to the tongue. Near a litre gone and it holds so well, keeping as if fresh poured with each sip. This is just one fantastic, true to style pilsner, the best I have had since returning from Deutschland and one worthy of more than just a Silver at the Beer awards. Definitely one I’d go out of my way to savour, a truly lovely drop!!! (90cL tankard, from draught)"
Indi White;Mindarie, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;Sample on tap at the 2007 Western Australian Beer Week Launch Poured a cloudy straw/white, with reasonable head retention, Nose was of rotting wheat, Flavour was slightly acrid with lashings of raw wheat. Not nice at all.
Indi White;Mindarie, Australia;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;This Witbier had a massive elegant coriander aroma on the nose, which translated into a drinkable belgium white with the mandarins on a secondary after taste. It was great to drink on the sunny day!
Indi Pale Ale;Mindarie, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;Pint on tap at The Garden, Leederville. Golden orange beer, creamy white head. Many tiny bubbles. Nose is citric and a bit grassy. Crisp, clean, bit of bite. Finishes with a herbal dryness and a late dash of bitter lemon. Looks great, smells great, tastes great. What's not to like?
Indi Pale Ale;Mindarie, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;On tap at the Brewhaus, Lovely englis hop aroma, bursting with a malty sweetness.Thick and malty on the palate, with a great floral bitterness. A truly pleasant surprise
Indi Pale Ale;Mindarie, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;"Draught @ the lovely, absolutely huge, no expense spared brewhouse, Mindarie Keys Marina, Mindarie. Honestly need to sit back and change my opinion of micro’s in Oz. We brew up some pleasant quaffer’s here and there, but the general Aussie beer drinker doesn’t want lactic sourness, yeasty extremities or high alpha acid ales, he/she just wants something that tastes like beer!?!?. Subconsciously, and hell even on the surface, I didn’t expect much of this ale. ’IPA’ as a term has been used and abused, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. And I think it lies in this gem. Tasted in it’s own standard pint glass, very British. Presented well; tight, though flaccid head of cream that lasted and legged it well down the glass. Body was a bright, sparkling orangey copper that held very fine intermittent streams of carbonation that were sluggish to erupt. The aroma is subdued; fresh, clean malts, orange marmalade, light breadyness and some yeast. Quite Summery and pleasing enough, but it does come alive in the mouth. Zingy, well rounded presence on the palate. Nice blend of juicy ripe oranges, toasted and crystallised malts, biting, spicy and bitter, grassy hops in back and a fresh as fresh, quenching swallow that holds well in the mouth. Body is medium, very firm and solid in feel and lightly prickly in carbonation. You could say this was served perfectly. Aftertaste shows some nutty, toasted malts and spicy, bitter oranges with just and edge of vanilla that my wife picked up on her first mouthful. The fact she found it refreshing was enough to say this was a damn fine Pale ale. This coming Summers perfect session ale. Balanced to perfection, well defined and has it all working in its own favour. Very Nice."
Indi Pale Ale;Mindarie, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;Slightly darker body than the pils, still with no head, this reminds of an English premium bitter, nice harsh citric sort of bitterness, some caramel notes on the taste and then some nutty notes on the finish.
Indi Belgian Ice;Mindarie, Australia;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Indian Ocean Brewing Company;Similar to the Indi White though much hazier and slightly darker body, the coriander and cloves are more in the background, body is more warming, oranges is more noticeable, I probably could not drink too many, almost syrupy, best lacing out of the lot and has a better nose. A 1/2 was served in a pilsener glass.

Emmetts Rauchbier;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap in west dundee dark brown tan head aromas of smoke and peat not my favorite style taste of smoke and hops would not sample again
Emmetts Rauchbier;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap on 11-26-08 at West Dundee location. Arrived to the table with a very thick foramy head, brown/red in color and a low/med carbonation. Aroma was very light and was composed of a smokey scent with some other roasted malt. Flavor has a lot of smoke flavor but definitely perfect amount. Other flavors are chocolate, coffee, dark roast, some brown ale flavors and a small amount of raisins. Mouth feel is not very low with low carbonation. Overall, the smokiness is perfect, the beer looks good but still only ranks as a beer I would have once in a while at the bar.
Emmetts Rauchbier;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Emmetts Brewing Co.;"Imperial pint draught, Downers Grove. Deep garnet body under a half-inch white and brown head that slips off the sides of the glass as beer goes down. Smell is indeed smoky; not overdone, though, I need to nose in close to find it. Yes, smoky taste upfront, but more like a Gouda than the bacony whiff of Schenklera (if you ever get to a Tinkoff Rauchbier, it’s in that range. Anyway, equal balance of darker srystal malt and basic north German hop thread lets the rauch take center stage. Very nice."
Emmetts Rauchbier;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Emmetts Brewing Co.;Draught at Downer’s Grove location 03/12/2007. Was glad to find this on tap on what the tender said was the first day. He was not familiar with the style, and said the brewer had not provided a description yet. He did not seem to interested in my elaborating so I dove in to this mildly smokey treat. Smoke more prevalent in the aroma where the woody smoked aromas meld with a strong malty body. Appears dark reddish brown, a bit effervescent with a nice bubbly head. Semi-sweet dry malty flavor with smoke and cascade hops just barely evident upfront and later in the dry mildly bitter finish. Light to medium in body, very smooth. Solid.
Emmetts Rauchbier;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Emmetts Brewing Co.;#874 <!-- p --> On tap at the brewery in West Dundee. <!-- p --> First off let me say that I am not a fan at all of the style. But I think that I can appreciate at least some of this. Dark dark with a thin tan head that is quickly discipating. The nose has some smoke to it but is mostly below the grains. The taste up front has some smoke to it but not nearly as offensive as most smoked are. I think that real fans of the style will find this weak and with a lot to desire. But if it is something that is more mild, more drinkable, more interesting and more enjoyable to drink than this is your brew. Give it a shot, you might be pleasantly surprised.
Emmetts Rauchbier;West Dundee, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Emmetts Brewing Co.;On tap at Great Taste of the Midwest festival. Aroma of sweet smoky notes. Dark auburn color. Tan head that quickly diminishes. Very malty taste, understating smoked flavor. I wasn’t sure what to expect from this one, but it was very easy to drink.

Sail & Anchor Gaisgeach;Fremantle, Australia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Sail & Anchor Brewery;Dark body, almost black with ruby tinges and a medium size light tan head. Burnt characters on the nose also in the taste, some tar, a little sticky, honey and cinnamon, caramel late in the peace, medium to full body and the alcohol is hardly noticeable, until to late. Served to cold, have 2 or 3 but that is enough.
Brays Stangs Swang Ginger Honey;Naples, Maine, United States;Flavored - Other;Brays Brewing;"On tap at the brewery’s ""One night stand"" event. Very impressive pour, nice amber golden color with extremely cloudy appearance. Extremely thick dense beer. The aroma is straight up ginger, more ginger than any other ginger i’ve had yet. The honey and ginger flavors do well together, think of it as Atlantics Bragget ale and Island Ginger mixed. It’s pretty tastey a bit sweet though, very interesting though."
Brays Vivacious Vanilla Porter;Naples, Maine, United States;Porter;Brays Brewing;"On tap at the brewery’s ""One night stand"" event. Oh yeah! This was the crowning Bray’s beer of the 6 I enjoyed that night (I try to do whole pints only none of that taster crap), Pours a dark brown unfiltered with a foamy head that goes away pretty quickly. God if there were more porters like this I think it would be my favorite style of beer! Vanilla and the sweet maltiness go together so well. Damn fine beer. I love this stuff."
Brays Pleasant Mountain Porter;Naples, Maine, United States;Porter;Brays Brewing;Draft at the brewery. Pours very dark reddish brown with a thin white head and lots of lacing.

This beers flavors and aromas are a stark contrast from the vanilla porter i had earlier in the night. Aromas are dark malt, sweet brown sugar, and some dingy cellar smells. Flavors were good although a bit normal, which isn’t a bad thing really, just a little bland. The brewer described it as moderately hopped, but I didn’t get much hop profile out of this one, must be those EK goldings again, i have trouble finding their flavor from time to time."
Bullfrog 10th Anniversary Red2;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bullfrog Brewery;Draught at the brewery. Dark red toast colored body, really nice looking in a pint glass, but the head is still and not very well formed. Has some hoppy, chewy, course malts and yeast in the nose, with some smoky charred plums and fresh cut cedar (hops) notes. This was supposedly highly hopped, on par with the Edgar IPA I was told, but I disagree - the courseness is distracting and not really necessary, and the bitterness seems artificial and out of place with the grain bill used for this beer. After a few big gulps I’m pretty sick of drinking this beer. The cedar and plum hop aromas are quite nice, but drinking this beer is another experience, and one I’m not into.
Bullfrog 10th Anniversary Red2;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - American;Bullfrog Brewery;Deep amber in color, small off-white head with only slight lacing around the glass, aroma full of caramel malt & a touch of pine, full-bodied, smooth & drinkable, flavors were of caramel, sweet & rich malt, nicely balanced with a good hop character in the body as well, very rich finish with more malt in the aftertaste, a very nice session beer

Hochstift Radler;Fulda, Hesse, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Hochstiftliches Brauhaus Fulda;Bottled. A light yellow beer with a thin white head. The aroma is a cloying lemon one, while the flavor, though cloyingly lemony still has some malt notes. And no wonder the body is thin.

Papago Little Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Dubbel;Papago Brewing;On tap at papago. Pours a nice light orange-lemon color with a nice head. Mild malt to caramel aroma. Light to sweet flavor, somewhat full-bodied. Flavor is a little drab, Light notes of fruit and sugar. Ends on the palate a mellow hoppiness, the alcohol finally comes through. A decent brew, but is it an abbey?
Papago Little Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Dubbel;Papago Brewing;warm, red apple pie aroma...yeast, fruit and sugar. flavor is vinous...probably from the alcohol, woody, malty and sweet with vanilla. full bodied and almost creamy. has a strange sourness on the finish that i can’t describe.
Papago Little Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Dubbel;Papago Brewing;At the 2007 Big Beer, Belgians, & Barleywines Festival in Vail. Opaque amber with an off-white head. Strong alcohol nose. This is a great beer with massive fruitiness collapsing onto a sturdy malt backbone. Has an incredibly long finish of caramel, bitterness and aromatic fruits.
Papago Little Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Dubbel;Papago Brewing;Draft at Papago. Clear orange-brown color with an off white head that laced the glass. Smelled of clove, light brown sugar, white wine, and pear. Sweet on the tongue. Flavor is less complex and dominated by malt which imparts a distinct brown sugar flavor. There was a warm splash of alcohol at the end. Not bad, but didn’t completely live up to its billing as an abbey ale.
Papago Little Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Dubbel;Papago Brewing;Poured an orange-brown color with a nice intial head, good retention, good lacing. The aroma was bubblegum and light caramel. The flavor was bubblegum, soap suds, some spiciness, but really lacking other Belgian qualities of dark fruits, candi sugar, yeast, etc... Alcohol was also rather sharp and perhaps this one was a bit on the astringent side of things. Not a great example of the Belgian style.
Papago Little Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Dubbel;Papago Brewing;Tap @ Papago. Had an over ripe apple aroma. Amber body with small head and some lacing. Surpy body texture with a moderate cherry, plumb and slight spice for flavor. Easy on the palate a smooth not over sweet brew.
Papago Little Brother;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;Dubbel;Papago Brewing;I can’t believe that the owner Ron can keep coming up with incredible new beers like this. This beer is a light amber color. Starts out on the sweet side with good caramel flavor and ends with a nice bitter, dry finish. Lots of Belgian character. The beer is said to be one of the few brewed in the U.S. with liquid Belgian candy sugar syrup. Most brewers use rock candy. Ron told me that he knows of only two other places who have tried using the syrup, Russian River and Chama River. It really made the beer very drinkable and one that is way to easy to quaff down.
Starobrno Øezák;Brno, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Starobrno Brewery (Heineken);"Unter einem ""Øezák"" versteht man in Tschechien in der Regel eine 1:2-Mischung (eine 1:1-Mischung gibt es lt chemischer Nomenklatur nicht) aus hellem und dunklem Bier. Zu Kaufen habe ich es noch nie gesehen. Im Restaurant gibt es 2 Versionen: Bei einer wird darauf geachtet, dass sich die Schichten nicht mischen. Es entsteht ein attraktiver Effekt (den man von Coucktails kennt), dass das dunkle Bier mit der geringeren Dichte oben ist und unten das helle. Bei vorsichtigen Servieren und Trinken hat man so 2 Biere in einem. Meist bekommt man aber die 2.Art, wo alles gemischt ist und das Bier einen trüben hellbraunen Farbton hat. Dieses ist eine Mischung aus dem Starobrno Tradièní und dem Krušovice Original Böhmisches Schwarzbier (Èerné), das ebenfalls von der Heineken-Familie kommt. Starobrno braut derzeit (Stand Jänner 2018) kein eigenes dunkles Bier. Das Bier vermischt gekonnt die guten malzig-süßen Noten des Dunklen mit den klassischen süffigen Aromen des Hellen. Es mag ein wenig gewöhnungsbedürftig sein, aber mir gefällt es."
Starobrno Øezák;Brno, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Starobrno Brewery (Heineken);Pours a medium ruby brown color. Aromas of malts, something fruity, and some grass. Flavor malty and crisp with some chocolate tones in the finish.
Starobrno Øezák;Brno, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Starobrno Brewery (Heineken);Tap in Graz - A highly addictive beer, somewhere in between a pale and a dark lager. Interesting malty notes, well balanced.

Starobrno Øezák;Brno, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Starobrno Brewery (Heineken);"Rating #703, bottle from a Tesco in Brno, Czech Republic A brown beer with nice head, and it even has lacings. Aroma is roasted malts but a bit of metal as well. Metal in the aroma is never a good sign, and as expected the taste was ridiculously metallic too, aside from the roasted malts. A person who sat next to me and didn’t have a clue about beer or beer tasting at all, meant that this beer tastes ""like old coins"", and I have to agree on that one. A bit chokolate as well, though. Beer is thinner than expected. Well, this wasn’t the best expierience, but I guess it’s a quite mediocre beer (or bit below) anyway. I have tasted worse."
Starobrno Øezák;Brno, Czech Republic;Amber Lager - Czech / Polotmavý;Starobrno Brewery (Heineken);Bottle. Clear reddish pour, thin off-white head. Aroma of caramel malts, sugar. Flavor is slightly bitter, slightly sweet. Thick bodied pils. Decent.
Pepperwood Mint-Juniper;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Traditional Ale - Other;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;A take on a sahti. Light yellow and lots of carbonation bubbles. Aggressively carbonated, malty, with juniper flavour and a drying finish. Some hop bitterness in there. Mostly like a rye beer.
Old Baldy IPA;Upland, California, United States;IPA;Old Baldy Brewing Company;Nice, hoppy IPA, not overly sticky, easy drinking, not a hop bomb,my favorite from Old Baldy.
Scotch Irish Gingers Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Kichesippi Beer Company;"draught. At 2006 Toronto Festival of Beer. Hazy gold, small white diminishing head. Strong ginger aroma, but not as sweet as some - didn’t make me think ""Canada Dry"" - lightly spicy and bitter. Flavour wasa nice blend of malt and pungent ginger, sweeter tasting than the aroma indicated, but some good herbal bitterness in the finish - thick, somewhat flat, syrupy - for a ginger, pretty nice ... not as beery as I’d like, but refreshing."
Scotch Irish Gingers Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Kichesippi Beer Company;TFOB 2006. Hazy golden orange, not much head. Prominent ginger aroma. Lots of ginger in the flavour, malt is in the background. Reminds me of my Dad’s ginger heavy stir fry.Average palate. Not bad. Could use a bigger beer backing to complement the ginger IMHO, but this was a pretty successful experiment! Nice job Perry.
Old Baldy Lager;Upland, California, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Old Baldy Brewing Company;Not bad for a lager, had some grassy flavor to it, abit heavier for a lager, but that was fine, probably best ice cold.
Old Baldy Hefeweizen;Upland, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Old Baldy Brewing Company;A great hefeweizen, nice color, lots of Banana, clove, slight tang, expecting less flavor to this one, but very close to German hefes I’ve had.
John Harvards British Pale Mild;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Sample at the Pittsburgh location. This beer is similar to Three Floyds Pride & Joy, just not as good. Clear golden color with virtually no head or lacing. Weak hops aroma, with a hint of malt. Light-bodied with subtle hoppiness that lives up (or down) to the title, along with a smattering of earthy malt flavor. The finish is pretty bland, and there is no real aftertaste. Didn’t do it for me.
John Harvards British Pale Mild;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;OK, I’m not really sure what a ’Pale Mild’ is. This was lager clear gold, so I’m calling it a golden ale. Very muted aroma. Tangy, lightly sweet, medium woody light bittering. Lagery. Finish is initally lightly sweet, then bitters. Clean drinking. Mild lemony notes. Bland.
Anheuser-Busch Burnin Helles;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);on tap at ’Memories’ in Richfield OH. not too bad, very alcoholy tasting. Nothing special about it.
Anheuser-Busch Burnin Helles;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Sampled from a Bottle compliments of a Budweiser Insider. Nice fizzy pour with a one inch white bubbly head that disapeared almost immediatley. Appearance was flouresant gold and amber with tiny bubbles rising like in champagne. Aroma was non existent. Flavor was stale dortmunder with traces of malt detectable. No aftertaste. All in all there was nothing memorable and I found the beer to be beyond boring. I won’t drink it again.
Anheuser-Busch Burnin Helles;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);What a nice refreshisg beer. Nice reddish color with an adequate head. This must be a new lager being developed by Bud and they did one hell of a job. Two thumbs up
Anheuser-Busch Burnin Helles;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12/06: Very nice. Looks great, light orange. It’s light,sweet and fruity. Got on tap at Ray’s Place in Kent, OH. 1/07: The bartender at BW3 in Streetsboro told me I was the first person to order this since they got it last summer..still good. Nice looking cloudy bright orange in color. Great unique fruity flavor with slight malt flavor. Smooth and easy to drink, and the aftertaste reminded me of those orange circus peanuts. AB needs to do a little better marketing to get word out on this...first person to drink it in 7 months- that’s crazy.
Anheuser-Busch Burnin Helles;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);No aroma. Dark golden color. Tasted like sour apples. Too sour for me. Not very good.
Anheuser-Busch Burnin Helles;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This draft brew from the Oktoberfest Zinzinati poured a head of medium sized white colored bubbles that was fully diminished and left behind a transparent softly carbonated orange colored body. The almost non-existant aroma was malty. The mildly vinous mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mellow finish with a mellow aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of mild astringent malt hops and mild orange. Not one that I would buy again.

New Glarus Bourbon Barrel Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;If New Glarus would give up trying to please the masses with spotted cow and just get to pleasing me they would brew this every year instead of (who knows, just make it happen) the hint of Bourbon is delightful with the pure taste of a Bock. This truly is the nectar of the gods!!
New Glarus Bourbon Barrel Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;I was first in line for this at the New Glarus line at GTMW 2006. Poured by Dan Carey himself and it was a very generous pour. Aroma is loaded with major bourbon, buttery caramel, brown sugar. Rich and malty, but perhaps a little too much bourbon? Dark, cloudy mahogany brown with a thick, off-white head that lasted and lasted. Flavor is sweet, loaded with fruity, caramel and bourbon flavors and a touch of vanilla oak in the finish. One of the most intensely bourbon infused brews that I have ever tried but the chewy, dried fruit, malt backbone is there to back it up. Full body, thick and creamy but the alcohol and astringent help dry it out a little. I know I have too many bourbon brews in my top 10, but they taste so damn good.
New Glarus Bourbon Barrel Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;served for about a minute at great taste of the midwest.. thank god for line cutting. Poured a coppery brown color quite murky w/ nearly no head. Smells of toasted carmels some dark fruits hints of bourbon maybe a touch of tobaccoo (or maybe someone lit up near me.) This stuff smelled good, although I think I liked the regular eisbock aroma better. Palate was full and creamy. Flavor had a very well blended taste some light tartness in the finish after a big carmel, chocolate, bourbon syruppy tastking front there were some hints of a leathery wood as well and a light spice. Very well done.
New Glarus Bourbon Barrel Eisbock;New Glarus, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Eisbock;New Glarus Brewing Company;2006 GTMW. Huge thanks to Dan for putting this together oh so many years ago, and to Nate for sharing this treat. Murky brown body, light tan/off-white head. Amazingly unique peppery A-1 steak and sweet bourbon. Very old-seeming and blended aroma. Flavor has A-1 again, cask, chocolate, sour brown hints, some pepper, aged caramel.

Beck's Level 7;Bremen, Bremen, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brauerei Beck & Co. - Beck's;For whatever reason, the Lufthansa business class lounge at Frankfurt was serving this stuff instead of beer. At least I didn’t have to pay for it. Bright glow-in-the-dark green color, huge yellow head with lots of fizziness. Aroma of grass, hay and lime. Taste is like a light lager with lime juice added, with a metallic finish. If you like soda, try this. if you like beer, don’t.

Merrydown Premium Medium Dry Cider;Gloucester, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;SHS Drinks;An orange cider with a bubbly white head. The aroma is sweet and plainly of apples. The flavor is quite sweet with strong apples and lighter wood notes, leading to a dry end with notes of apple core in the after taste. Not bad, but nothing special either.

Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;Overpowering mandarin aroma mixed with toffee. The head is very thick off-white. Alcoholic taste which is slightly offset with heaps of bitterness. Dry aftertaste caused by the alcohol. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;Nice malty aroma. Clearish brown colour with ok head. Strong alcoholic malt flavour with smooth bitter finish. Heavy body with low carbonation.
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;Well balanced brew - heavy toffee malt (a bit too toasty for my palate) and earthy herbal hops - serious ale - dark in the glass and thick on the tongue like an English beer. Enjoyed although I prefer the American style, paler, less malt-driven, fruitier high octane ales.
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;It pours cloudy brown with almost no head, aroma of toffee, doesn’t really smell like an IPA, taste is mildly bitter and malty.
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;A decent IPA from a Victorian microbrewery. Had a bottle at Mrs Parmas, decent amount of hops, bitterness and strong malt character. To sound like an absolute beer w##nker for a moment, it tasted a little old school IPA if you know what I mean. In the 2000’s this would have been utterly cutting edge. This being said, a great IPA which i would drink again if on offer.
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;Pours almost a brown colour with a good white head. Strong aroma of peach, passionfruits and some malts. Taste, however, is s bit disappointing. Way too malty and a tad to bitter for my taste. Some tropical fruits also, but not that present. Quite big body, fizzy aroma and a abit sticky mouthfeel. Overall, an okey IPA, but some flaws in my opinion.
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;330ml bottle. Pours a deep amber with two fingers of fine off white head. Nose is orange, slight peach and a bit of a boozy note. Taste is really just some citrus and pine, with lots of bitterness on the finish. Body is medium. Not particularly impressed by this. The flavour profile and aroma are very boring. Perhaps it’s an old bottle. This one night need a re-rate.
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;Bottle (330ml). Hazy copper-brown pour with decent white head and lace. Malty aromas dominate (caramel mainly) with fruity hops (oranges, cherries) and alcoholic presence. Palate is smooth and creamy with a medium body and well balanced malt and hops flavour profile. Finishes moderately bitter with an alcoholic burn.
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;Pours a dark cloudy brown with a large, frothy beige head. Aroma is malt, caramel, fruit and some hops. Taste is medium sweet leading to a moderate bitter finish. Good one.
Jamieson The Beast IPA;Jamieson, Victoria, Australia;IPA;Jamieson Brewery;Bottle from Mane Liquor. Pours a cloudy copper with a thin tan head. Resin hop aroma with a balanced toffee back. Taste is very dimensional. Tasting a variety of hop flavours like citrus, tropical and also piney/resin, all while retaining the toasty caramel undercurrent. Booze is concealed, just a slight warmth in the bitter aftertaste. Great IPA.
Tahquamenon Falls Lumberjack Lager;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass (doh, where’s the pilsener for this one). Sigh, don’t get me started. Anyways, well, here’s the rest of it. The appearance was a fairly decent golden yellow color with a one and a half finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds to leave some fairly decent adequate lightly foamy lacing. The smell seemed to be more of a sweet corn adjunct of sorts with a light cornbreadiness to come out slightly. The taste was mainly sweet and didn’t have much balance. It had a dry finish. On the palate, this one sat fairly light and definitely had a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation was dry and not exactly sharp, but it did show its presence. Overall, as my last Tahq Falls beer to put in here, I’d say this was okay, it was nothing over the top nor was it anything bad. Too bad, I couldn’t have had it in a pilsener.
Tahquamenon Falls Lumberjack Lager;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;tap at the brewpub - Pours clear yellow-gold with an off-white head. It has a bready malt aroma and a sweet, grainy, bready malt flavor with a light body. Decent.
Tahquamenon Falls Lumberjack Lager;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. While their ales are not very good, I rather enjoyed this lager. Pours gold with a small head. Corn and slight hop flavor.
Tahquamenon Falls Lumberjack Lager;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub. Difficult to find much to say about this - as far as I could tell this is a bog standard brewpub lager designed for BMC drinkers. Maybe slightly better than its commercial counterparts but not a whole lot. I say ""as far as I could tell"" because there were no sampler trays at this brewpub (with only three beers available there wouldn’t be much point anyway) so I was reduced to a miniscule taster in a plastic cup - I sure wasn’t going to have a whole pint. Inoffensive but uninspiring stuff."
Tahquamenon Falls Lumberjack Lager;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pour of clear pale gold, with a rim of white. Light distant stale malt, heavy on the dextrose. Edges of pot roast creep in. Flavor is a bold chewy sugar, with heavy and reeking corn fusels. There’s a light nutty sweetness in the sugar but it gets run over buy a truck full of sweet corn. Palate is mostly cloying.
Tahquamenon Falls Raspberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pour a hazy orange with a white head. Fairly pronounced raspberry in the aroma and taste.
Tahquamenon Falls Raspberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a decent looking hazy orange to amber color with a quarter finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a half a minute. There was some light lacing trying to stick but mainly slid right on into the beer. The smell had the raspberry that came through slightly tart but let in a decent sweetness to balance. The taste was mainly sweet but had a decent light tartness to balance. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed appropriately styled and was fairly easy to me. Overall, okay I didn’t get as much wheat I did in the peach and the blueberry one but honestly I’m okay with that.
Tahquamenon Falls Raspberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pour of pale evenly hued amber gold. Rim of white. No aroma, save for a light dusting of raspberry and old woman perfume. Fake raspberry syrups drains this beer of any soul. Flavor is dominated by artificial candy. Malt dies. Palate is starchy with a flowery effervescence of raspberry sugars.
Tahquamenon Falls Porcupine Pale Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Draft. Weqkeat of their offerings spicy and garbage. Surprising since their system looks pretty nice.
Tahquamenon Falls Porcupine Pale Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a decent golden pale yellow color with a quarter finger of white foaminess that didn’t show much lacing once it dissipated. The smell had some light citrus to piney hops that seemed kinda burnt. Hmmm...uh..ok, I guess. The taste was mainly sweet but had a weird burnt/perhaps overly cooked hop bitterness to it. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a sessionability that seemed to be slightly desired. The carbonation seemed okay for the style and okay to me. Overall, hmmm...I’m not sure what happened with the smell but it seemed to have affected the taste. This brewpub has better beers and this isn’t one of them.
Tahquamenon Falls Porcupine Pale Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the park brewpub, sampled early August. Ruddy orange body, thin to no head. Light to absent body, with poorly developed bready malts that fail to buffer the palate against strange sour sweaty off-notes that are also present in the aroma. Lifeless stale dreck. I can only pray that the thousands of visitors to the falls who enter this brewpub avoid Porcupine Pale Ale, which may have been secretly developed to help devastate the craft beer movement.
Tahquamenon Falls Porcupine Pale Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pour of hazed orange amber, with a fringe of light fold. Light aroma of pepperoni. Flavor is a meaty sour hop sugar. Very tart West Coast hops, not carried by body or alcohol. Touches of sloppy pork fat edges. Thin bodied with a touch of sweet orange and light grapefruit. Palate has a note of toast, but mostly grass.

Lafayette Phoenix Strong Ale;Lafayette, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - English;LAF Lafayette Brewing Company;This was available both on tap and from the cask at the brewpub, and I had the latter version. (I was getting too full at this point to do both that day.) This had a dark chestnut body with a bubbly beige head. The aroma is rich and malty without being sweet, a light floral/earthy hoppiness cutting that back. This has a slightly thin mouthfeel yet delivers plenty of lavor. It tastes of bready malt, dark caramel, smoked wood, pepper, and an earthy/floral bitterness that lasts well into the finish. Nice. Lafayette Brewing Company, Lafayette, IN
Lafayette Phoenix Strong Ale;Lafayette, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - English;LAF Lafayette Brewing Company;From the cask during my Great Lakes region brew tour. Dark red pour with a white head. Bready nose of yeast and narrow acidity. The mouthfeel is thick and warming with low carbonation. There is a wood-flavor throughout and a taste of rye toast. The hops are floral, akin to the taste of hibiscus. Bittersweet baking chocolate finish with notes of cedar. This wasn’t my favorite from this pub, but it is definitely unique and balanced. I’m convinced that Lafayette knows what’s up.
Lafayette Phoenix Strong Ale;Lafayette, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - English;LAF Lafayette Brewing Company;Cask pulled sampler at LBC. My first beer on my first visit to this spot. Beer is very dark brown with a settled head. Thin mouthfeel matches the cask style. Slight coffee notes. A nice alcohol nose shows through toward the end. Deceptively mild tasting, and light on hops, therefore something not to be mistaken for a session beer.
Lafayette William Henrys Porter;Lafayette, Indiana, United States;Porter;LAF Lafayette Brewing Company;on tap-pours a light brown head and black with red color. Aroma is rich dark malt-chocolate. Taste is rich dark malt-chocolate/molasses, nutty, secondary coppery hops.
Lafayette William Henrys Porter;Lafayette, Indiana, United States;Porter;LAF Lafayette Brewing Company;Draft sampler glass at LBC. Low level of CO2 helps accentuate this historical style. First impression is that it’s a bit peaty. Then some nice, big coffee notes. A nice hop load gives it a northwestern tilt that really nice. Tastes much stronger than it probably is, abv wise.
Lafayette William Henrys Porter;Lafayette, Indiana, United States;Porter;LAF Lafayette Brewing Company;Draught during my Great Lakes region brew tour. This porter fills this glass with a ruby body and a small tan head. The aroma flirts with the unorthodox by showcasing a bright grapefruit scent. Of course, more obvious porter notes are present: coffee, caramel. This is an interesting brew indeed. More zesty pine and grapefruit is apparent in the flavor. It certainly isn’t super hoppy, but for a porter. . . . the coffee notes are certainly subdued.
Carver X-Rock Bock;Durango, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Carver Brewing Company;(sampled at the Manitou Craft Lager Festival 8/14/11). Clear amber color. Medium off white head. Moderate bready malt aroma and flavor, with light sweet caramel. Avg duration. Smooth finish. Thin texture. Moderate carbonation. Fair lacing.
Carver X-Rock Bock;Durango, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Carver Brewing Company;On tap @ 2011 Craft Lager Fest. Medium clear copper, faint head. Aroma of toasted cereal malts, toasted bread, and a freshly made tortilla from Mexico. Tasted of roasted caramel, burnt toast, and some rye. Very smooth and velvety, but almost too much so. Off-tasting finish. Almost pretty good.
Carver X-Rock Bock;Durango, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Carver Brewing Company;Tasted at 2010 Craft Lager Festival in Manitou Springs. Dark amber with a thin off-white head. Caramel and chestnut aroma, flavors matching with a hint of hop resin at the finish. Thin and slightly watery, but this was tasted right after a big doppelbock, so that might explain the discrepancy in body.
Carver X-Rock Bock;Durango, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Carver Brewing Company;tap. copper/amber pour. sweet malty, floral aroma. funky. more floral than the amber but it seems almost like the same beer. not a good bock.
Carver X-Rock Bock;Durango, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Carver Brewing Company;Draught. Body is dark amber. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie, caramel), with a strong note of diacetyl, note of bubble gum. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter, unclean. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Wow. Quite a study in diacetyl.
Carver LaPlata Pilsner;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Carver Brewing Company;Draft at GABF 2013. Lightly musty nose of baked bread, spice / pepper and green vegetable leaf hops, light notes of boiled egg (but not sulfuric, really). Medium body, rich malt, sugary lemon candy hop presence. Low acid and higher than normal sweetness give it some balance problems in the mouth for me, but for the most part it’s clean, just basic and simple.
Carver LaPlata Pilsner;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Carver Brewing Company;On tap during 2011 Craft Lager Fest. Transparent straw yellow & a small head. Smells like a clean swimming pool and some fresh grass. Pretty interesting, if a little weird. Tasted of clean munich malt, but with a funny pool-water twang. Dry and slightly metallic. Just a little weird for me.
Carver LaPlata Pilsner;Durango, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Carver Brewing Company;Tap. Pours clear light yellow with a medium, frothy white head, some retention with good lacing. Aroma is malt (grain, meal), fruity with perfume hops.

Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;Draft. Dark brown pour, briney, tart, sweet, dark fruit, booze, bit strong fo rme.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;On tap at Side Door. Pours near clear orange with a gold hue and an off white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma is full of sour berries with some acid and a light oak and funk note. Flavor combined red wine, oak and sour stone fruit and a bit of grain backing.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;On tap at GTMW 2014, pours an unclear amber brown with a thin off white head, the aroma has a decent amount of tartness and vinegar along with some dark fruit’s, the flavor has a sour and funky front end with plum and cherry coming through with a vinegar like finish, interesting stuff.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;On tap at GTMW 2014 - Pours hazy amber with a white ring of head. Nose is lemon rind, vinegar--very malty and tart. Taste is lemon, tart vinegar, yogurt, and a bit of cherry. Medium-bodied and well-carbonated.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;On tap at GTMW 2014 A solid American wild ale from the central Midwest, this diamond in the rough exceeded any preconceived notions about Brugge Brasserie. Rather than a middle of the road forgettable experience it offered a tart bite and strong attitude. If I run across this again while visiting Indianapolis it may merit a full pint. Aroma / Appearance - A cloudy caramel base hazed the glass like a melted stick of chocolate. Tart vinegar bit at the air with the smell of caramel and melted chocolate. Flavor / Palate - A pleasant texture for a 12% ABV beer flows across the tongue. Vinegar soaked Twix bars stick to the corners of the palate with a sweet and sour profile. A full pour might be difficult to drink quickly but this remains an ideal beer for savoring over a long dinner. If other Brugge beers are this excellent I may have to visit next time I pass though the Indianapolis area.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;Great Taste of the Midwest 2014 Offering (Madison, WI). Pours a dulled decent hazed amber brown hue, a bit of orange glow on the edges and bottom with loose bubbly whitish head. Aromas are sour, a bit acidic with touches of plum, firmer oak and mellow acidity. Touches of wine barrel, tannic elements and firmer sourness, dark fruit shows plum, a bit of prune and dried fruit. Initial is dry, tart and a bit darker. Nice dark fruit. Firm sourness and an off salty element. Some gentle wine barrel, decent oak. More reeled in. Nice acidity, firm sourness but not overwhelming. A bit dry and yogurty into the backend and finish. Some nice tannic plum nectar and skin. Nice stuff. A bit darker, the plums really win me over with subtle citrus, nice acidity without getting harsh. Nice, fuzzy, dry as we finish. A winner.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;This draft brew from a beer festival poured a small sized head of frothy medium sized tan colored bubbles that were and left behind a hazy dark ruby red brown colored body and a oily lacing. The mild aroma was funky farm house and sour. . The flavor contained notes of sour funk and brown malt. A decent one but not one that I would consider drinking again.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;Snifter pour served up at three floyds brewpub. Awesome to see this on tap as I’ve been seeking this for awhile... Pours a deeper black almost stouty hued consistency, opaque mostly with deeper red edges. A thin to medium creamy light beige head rests on top which then gently recedes to a wispy film... Aroma of tart cherry and apple cider qualities, sour plum to be sure but wouldn’t have been able to pick it out on their own. Sour and tart and right up my alley. Some similarities to Joe the Plum for the sake of comparison... Earthy sour fruit and somewhat muted sweetness from the base beer. Light sour cherries, a mild degree of soft vinegar, and tart red fruit, plum not so discernable overall. Doesn’t quit deliver on the sour front and is held in check for the majority nor does it really need it. An off sour vapory medicinal note was apparent at first but slowly tapered off thankfully. A touch boozy but not overly so considering the abv and base style that is represented. Just shy of medium bodied, not full or syrupy in any way. A light lingering sweetness left on the palate.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;sample at GABF on 10/1/11. murky brown pour with no head. light nose with light brett and sweet fruit. medium body with a light funk, light oak and very sweet. tangy finish with light brett. avg.
Brugge Brasserie Diamond Kings of Heaven 2009 - Present;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Brugge Brasserie;A: The pour is amber in color, maybe approaching copper, with a small layer of white foam that quickly dissipates. S: You definitely get the pickled plums that were added to the barrel. A nice fruity and tart quality overall, and a touch of wine and oak. Maybe a little bit of citrus and a hint of sweetness. T: Unfortunately, the flavor is note quite as enjoyable as the aroma. There are some of the pleasant fruity notes of the plums and wine, but there is also a fair amount of booze, vinegar, and some acetone. M: Medium in body with a low to medium level of carbonation. O: I liked the nose, but there were some serious flaws in the flavor which prevented this from being as enjoyable as the previous incarnation of Diamond King.
C.K. Browar Weizen;Kraków, Poland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.K. Browar;Pajiza amarillenta, sin apenas espuma. Aroma cítrico y trigo. En boca se asemeja a witbier belgas. Muy ligera de paso muy fácil, muy suave al paladar, sin apenas gas.
C.K. Browar Weizen;Kraków, Poland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.K. Browar;Pale colour, sparkling, small head. Aroma is banana, wheat, no spices. Light bitterness. Not very interesting, but quite ok.
C.K. Browar Weizen;Kraków, Poland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.K. Browar;On tap at source, pours hazy weak golden, served with a slice of lemon, ouch. Aroma and taste is clearly influenced by the lemon, crisp and juicy, not bad
C.K. Browar Weizen;Kraków, Poland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.K. Browar;On tap @ C.K. Browar, Kraków. Beer was served with a slice of lemon on the rim of the glace. Who does something like that? Milky yellow with a thin white head. Big citrus and faint banana aroma. Taste is very sweet and wheatty. Not on par with most weizens at all
C.K. Browar Weizen;Kraków, Poland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.K. Browar;Better than the first two lagers I had. But not even remotely average on the hefeweizen vibe. Pours hazy golden with good head and lacing. Tastes like there is lime already in it even though I didn't squeeze the lime. Orange peel. Sweet, slightly tangy finish. Tap at brewpub.
C.K. Browar Weizen;Kraków, Poland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.K. Browar;On tap at C.K. Browar, pours a cloudy dull yellow with a small white head, and served with a lemon wedge. Aroma brings out banana, with lemon and clove. Flavour is dominated by lemon and banana, with light clove and some cocoa wheat. Nothing special here, but it’s drinkable.

C.K. Browar Weizen;Kraków, Poland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.K. Browar;Aroma yeasty with hint of citrus. Yellow pour with large head. Aroma a bit bland: wheat, veggies, light bitterness. My glass was flat with nearly no carbonation. Faulty but not necessarily bad.
C.K. Browar Weizen;Kraków, Poland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;C.K. Browar;0.15 draft @ CK Browar Hazy, gold with a large, white head. Aroma is quite acceptable actually. Once again too sweet but this was the best of them all.
Sakura Gao Honjozo Namachozo Sake;Morioka-shi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Sakuragao Shuzo;A clear, nearly colorless sake. Just a shade of yellow/green. Lots of fruity scents, like a fruitcake soaked in vodka. A bit unsophisticated compared to the softer flavors of Niigata or Hyogo ken sake but this is what I miss about not living up north anymore. A simple, yet good Tohoku countryside namsake. Thanks for adding this Jordan!
Sakura Gao Honjozo Namachozo Sake;Morioka-shi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Sakuragao Shuzo;300mL Bottle: Misty, nice even legs, nose of bright citrus and melon, some like kiwi and alcohol. The flavor is fairly rough with some grain and alcohol notes, a bit more floral and fruity in the tail though with a nice minerally mouthfeel. Quite nice and floral in the finish, balance, mouthfeel and nose. The flavor is a bit brash, but it’s excusable. Overall a very nice nama sake with some excellent flavors vs. the semaibuai. Thanks Dan!
Backcountry Broken Spoke Saison;Frisco, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Backcountry Brewery (CO);22 oz bomber purchased at brewery in August 2007. First had this after my son and I climbed Grays Peak 14,270 feet. Needless to say I was very thirsty after that romp. Pours bright yellow and very carbonated with a big white head. Nose of horse blanket, spices, funkiness, nice. Tastes comes through bitter and dry with pepper and spices. Good thirst quencher and well done for an American version of a Belgium farmhouse beer.
Backcountry Broken Spoke Saison;Frisco, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Backcountry Brewery (CO);Bomber poured a clear gold with a lasting white head. Aromas of straw, spice, citrus, pineapple and a hint of banana. Palate was light bodied crisp and slightly dry. Flavors of straw, fruitiness, light spice and a hint of carmel with a crisp slightly dry finish.
Backcountry Broken Spoke Saison;Frisco, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Backcountry Brewery (CO);Had this beer at the All Colorado Beer Fest on 11/10/2007. Aroma is a sweet scent with banana back tones. Color is a hazy yellow/gold with ok carbonation and a thin head. This is good but not great. Its a very Hefe like Saison with a sweet body and banana back tones.
Backcountry Broken Spoke Saison;Frisco, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Backcountry Brewery (CO);Draught at All Colorado Beer Festival. Pours hazy yellow with a small, fizzy, white head, lasting with fair lacing. Aroma is average malt (grain, hay, straw), average hops (flowers, citrus), average yeast (dough, barnyard, earth) with notes of banana and pear. Light bodied, sticky texture, lively carbonation, and a bitter finish. Average duration, light sweetness, moderate acidity and bitterness.
Backcountry Broken Spoke Saison;Frisco, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Backcountry Brewery (CO);[GABF, Denver Co - 2006] Golden copper color with a thick creamy head this was a great session beer.

Backcountry Broken Spoke Saison;Frisco, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Backcountry Brewery (CO);golden/copper pour with many rising bubbles. thick creamy white head. banana, yeast, psice and vegetable aroma. very spicy and tart. banana, spicy. balance is all off and this is difficult to drink. nice lacing.
Backcountry Broken Spoke Saison;Frisco, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Backcountry Brewery (CO);Draft: Clear light-orange. Noisy head fizzles into nothing. Uninteresting nose of baked apples, lightly toasted malt, and unripe banana. Very yeasty. Soft and fuzzy carbonation. Sweet and tacky upfront, with honey and toasted malt being the primary flavor. Airy phenols do make an appearance, but any positive influence is minimal. Touch of acidity and honeydew melon increase, but are overrun by the sweetness. Lightly toasted malts dust the palate before finishing overly sweet and uncleanly yeasty with lasting notes of bubblegum. Just another Americanized Saison that’s too sweet, wet, and saturated with yeast.
Backcountry Broken Spoke Saison;Frisco, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Backcountry Brewery (CO);Head is mostly diminishing. Body is clear dark yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers), with light notes of clove, pepper, and lemon zest. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Aroma started things off somewhat promising, despite being pretty light there were some nice fermentation characters in there. But the clear body and nearly unmatched sweetness keeps this in only the most mediocre tier of American renditions.
Alpine Beer Company Nelson IPA;Alpine, California, United States;IPA - Rye;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Slightly hazy yella. White grape Nelson Sauv hop aroma. Sappy, honey hops, medium bodied, dry Nelson hop second wave. Long hoppy finish. Not all that bitter. I guess the rye lends itself to the full body but Im not tasting it so much. Still a Duet man myself.
Alpine Beer Company Nelson IPA;Alpine, California, United States;IPA - Rye;Alpine Beer Company (CA);"[On tap at Fullerton Brewing Co, Fullerton, CA.] A hazy amber pour with a thin white head; clean grape aroma; full bodied with a touch of spice from the rye and a clean crisp bitterness. The rye seems to mask some of the aromatics from the Nelson Sauvin hops, but otherwise this is a nicely balanced IPA."
Alpine Beer Company Nelson IPA;Alpine, California, United States;IPA - Rye;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Can from BevMo in Dana Point. Translucent yellow orange pour with fine dissipating white head. Aroma is grassy, some pine, some light citrus, malt is sort of straw/dusty, but in a good way. Nice. Taste is solid pine bitterness at the start, grassy hops, some citrus, slight spice from rye. Tasty very solid, straightforward IPA. Not super juicy, not super dank, not super Nelson-y, but the crisp white wine flavors are there. Smooth finely carbonated palate. Very good, though maybe not as good as I expected given ratings.
Alpine Beer Company Nelson IPA;Alpine, California, United States;IPA - Rye;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Slightly hazy amber orange with a small white head. Aroma of tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, melon. Medium bodied, moderate to high bitterness, clean, tasty, winning. Definitely reminds me of Duet.
Elegancia Clasico;Red Hill, Vic, Australia;Apple Cider;Mock Orchards;"Well, whilst I’m bothering to rate something I might as well have a crack at this one too, because it was a very pleasant surprise. I’ve never had a Spanish-style cider, so I have no idea how close this one is, but this was really distinctive and interesting stuff. The people at Mock Orchards evidently aren’t that impressed - I was only offered the other two for tasting and when I expressed interest in buying a bottle I was greeted with a ""You know it’s still - as in uncarbonated - right?"" Despite this glowing endorsement I persisted with my purchase, and I’m very glad I did. It’s incredibly pale stuff, and yes - it’s still! Marked matchstick aroma like a Riesling (actually I’m not sure if I can recall a Riesling that smelled like this, so perhaps I should say it smelled like a Riesling with matchsticks mixed in) with a very subtle but incredibly fresh appliness, vaguely like a Granny Smith but far more refined. Incredibly light-bodied and dry, mildly tart with a touch of bitterness and a finish vaguely reminiscent of Cantillon. However the distinctive feature is this amazingly vibrant, fresh, crisp sea air and apple flavour without a hint of sweetness, yet it’s in perfect balance. It’s a lot like a Riesling, only at half the alcohol and dead dry. Incredibly drinkable stuff. I could see myself chugging down a whole lot of this stuff on a summer’s day."
Rock Bottom Cleveland Pivo Pilsener;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Dubbel;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);Clear straw gold. Muted aroma. Peppery - in a word - black pepper on tablewater crackers. Dry . Feints at fruitiness. Medium-light body. Longish finish revisits the Saazy bittering. Medium to medium light bittering. Crisp, a bit corny.
Rock Bottom Cleveland Cream Stout;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Stout;Rock Bottom Cleveland (CraftWorks);Boring and watery. Horridly lacking in just about every department. It wasn’t offensive, but it was underbittered without much coffee, roast or chocolate.

Hardanger Sider Tradisjonell;Ulvik, Norway;Apple Cider;Hardanger Saft- og Siderfabrikk;0.75l corked bottle. Yeah, it’s clear and normal golden looking in the glass this. Lots of big translucent bubbles that quickly fizzes away. It also has quite a lot of bubbles going on that’s rising in the glass. Smells sweet and quite nice. Apply, not to sweet with a light fresh sugary hint. Nice non extreme aroma. Soft dry apply mealy flavors. Some pink grapes with wood and soft sulfur blended with flowers. Well, it’s definitely tasty but not a instant favorite in my mouth. I did not notice the 10 percent alcohol even at the bottom of the glass. Well masked sir, well masked indeed. Don’t really see myself paying the somewhat steep price to have this again. 29.11.2013

Hoegaarden Peach Grapefruit;Hoegaarden, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Hoegaarden (AB InBev);I found this beer one year ago in a cafe in Antwerp, but I haven’t found it since than. Hoegaarden flavoured with peach and grapefruit, bottle wrapped in a gray plastic. Hazy light orange coloured with a sweet fruity malty aroma. There is still some hoegaarden aroma and taste, but it is sweeter and fruitier than the regular Hoegaarden. Finish is sweet fruity, little taste of peaches, with some strange touches. Not that bad.

Wilde Rose Helles;Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Wilde Rose Bräu-Keller;"Draft at Hotel Wilde Rose in Bamberg. Sparkling gold with a fine white head. Aroma impression is lemon, pepper, herbs, toasted malt, honeysuckle and dandelion. Lightly sweet with suitable bitterness, this is a lip-smacking and clean Helles with lively effervescence, fluffy and filling the mouth, just about the perfect balance and mouthfeel you want for the style, with lovely malt and hop expression. Light bodied but with a plump cushion of carbonation and savory malt make it seem more medium-bodied. Finish is juicy and scrumptious with enjoyably subtle bitterness. That magical baked baguette Pilsner malt and lemon-y noble hop combination is done well here, plus it’s superbly clean and savory. Overall a stellar example of a classic Bavarian Helles that is the definition of ""beauty in simplicity""."

MacGregors Scotch Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);On tap @ MacGregors Jefferson Ave. Disappointing. Wouldn’t classify this as a Scotch at all or If I was STier I’d be embarassed to. No balls or flavor on this. Watery, light to no aroma. slightly sweet even some cherry taste. Boo
MacGregors Scotch Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);(draft @ MacGregor’s - Canandaigua, NY) Dark copper color with a puffy tan head. Aroma is light with some hops and a decent amount of roasted malts. Flavor is slightly bitter with some hops and earth notes and a touch of sweet and caramel malts. Sweet and caramelly in the finish.
MacGregors Scotch Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Tap at MacGregor’s - Henrietta, NY Reddish-orange body with a light head. Smooth mouthfeel though somewhat too hoppy in my opinion to be considered a Scotch Ale. Very light earth tones in the taste with a sweet ending.
MacGregors Scotch Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);On Tap on MacGregor’s in Chili. Nice sweet malty body to this beer. I did not notice any hops in there. Very enjoyable.
MacGregors Scotch Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);I was not overly impressed with this offering. Minimal aroma, bit of dough is all. Malty palate with an odd tasting hop underbite. I don’t know what the hops were doing in the scotch. Average.
MacGregors Scotch Ale;Lakewood, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);On Tap on MacGregor’s in Henrietta. Very dark pour with a lasting head (probably from the tap). Aroma is very mild. Maybe just a touch of sweet smoke. The flavor brings out a bit more of the peat smokiness. Pretty sweet. The 6.5% or so of alcohol definitely brings some nice body to this beer, but it could use a bit more flavor.
MacGregors Cherry Weiss;Lakewood, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Had on tap at Chili McGregor’s. Only a very small white head on this one. Nice aroma of cherries. Broke a ’Man Law’ with a fruited beer. It had nice cherry wheat flavor and went down fast. Good beer to start with when you are really thirsty.
MacGregors Cherry Weiss;Lakewood, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Had on tap at Chili McGregor’s. Very high aroma of cherries (served with a cherry too - don’t fruit the beer...) Palate of cherries otherwise very light. Pale color.
MacGregors Cherry Weiss;Lakewood, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Brewed for MacGregors due to Sam Adams’ rising cost of their cherry wheat. Fruit beers are not my favorite, so I am not the best person to rate this. Tastes like Cherry Wheat to me. It is Southern Tiers first fruit beer, so I give them credit for a decent first try.
MacGregors Cherry Weiss;Lakewood, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);On Tap at MacGregor’s in Henrietta. Super light yellow color. One or two shades away from water. There is a head, but I attribute that to the tap more than the beer. The aroma and flavor are very much like cherry cough syrup or a cough drop. The body is exceptionally light and the cherry flavor is really the only thing going on. Very weak and sad excuse for a beer, but I’m sure that is what MacGregor’s asked for.
Schlafly Eisbock;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Saint Louis Brewery;Aroma is strong and fairly straightforward, with what I call chewy caramel followed by a spicey, alcoholic tinge. Dark brown in color with a thick and creamy head. Flavor is sweet and chocolaty, like a soft caramel covered in milk chocolate. Creamy, full body and high carbonation. On-tap at 2006 GTMW.
Schlafly Eisbock;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Bock - Eisbock;Saint Louis Brewery;"Tap @ GTMW 2006. Translucent and caramel-honey brown in color with a well-retained, foamy and off-white cap for the head. Sincere aroma presents rubbery chestnuts, almond-accented apple butter, nutmeg & spruce spice bread, caramel toffee and light fruited figs. Flavor semi-fulfills with a more pronounced body than the brewery’s doppelbock. Almond butter hits the dry milk chocolate cocoa powder with a mild chestnut smoothness. Something’s saying ""Christmas eisbock."" It’s easy going, just missing any element of stand-out ability. Milk chocolate smoothness hits talc like textures with an applewood and balsa wood scratch formality. Decent bock, but you don’t automatically get a good eisbock by freezing any old doppelbock."
Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Atwater Brewery;Coffee and caramel, with some roast. Some booze. Pours black with decent mocha head and lacing. Bittersweet finish with a dose of finish. Tap at Plum Market in Detroit airport.
Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Atwater Brewery;Pours dark brown with a foamy head that lingers. Aroma is bread, roast and hops. Taste is surprisingly bitter for a doppelbock, with hints of caramel and cereal. Finish is hoppy. Not what I was expecting from a doppelbock.
Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Atwater Brewery;Nice acidic mouth feel that builds a mocha soft chocolate on the palate. A little bitterness is very faint in the back of your mouth. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Atwater Brewery;Bottle. Pours a cloudy amber with small off white head. The aroma is roast and caramel. Thin mouth spice, roasted malt, light bitter finish, good.
Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Atwater Brewery;12 oz bottle. Poured an opaque dark brown/black with a frothy tan head and phenomenal lacing. Taste of brown sugar, vanilla, caramel with a slight dark chocolate bitterness finish. Fizzy carbonation, medium-full body, creamy texture. Overall, the alcohol is hidden well and the flavor is there, but it’s too faint for me and not as prominent as I’d like it to be.
Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Atwater Brewery;Bottle - smells roasty and of bread. Sip adds metal and caramel with a slight grassiness. Really sweet with dark chocolate bitterness. Not what I would call a doppelbock. A little harsh.
Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Atwater Brewery;Thanks drowland! Not a great beer. Weird metallic taste and a lot of caramel sweetness. Not much else. Not much nuance. Oh well.

Atwater Voodoo Vator Doppelbock;Detroit, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Atwater Brewery;Missed my flight from Grand Rapids to Chicago because of the dumbass Chicago weather and so spent the night in the airport and pulled this out of my suitcase to drink with some Chex Mix. From the bottle, and so can’t tell what it looks like. Smells really malty with lots of caramel and toffee. Alcohol is noticeable. Decent beer.
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Bottle as an extra from funkyaudio. Aroma and flavor is typical Baltic porter, but very good. Very smooth and enjoyable. Great beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;A good porter-- I agree with some other raters that the palate here is actually one of the more remarkable aspects, really nice thick creamy feel, without being too heavy. I must say, aside from the cool bottle art, nothing about this beer is very 3F. Fairly tradiitonal porter, no especially noteable hop notes. Good stuff that would hold its own against most any other porter.
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;nitrotap at the brewpub....rating number 100 which happened at FFF. woohoo!.....aroma: didn’t get too much out of this one except for the presence of some roasted malts and chocolate....appearance: looked very enticing coming out of the nitro. very creamy with a nice settling effect similar to a guinness pour. decent sized tan head....taste: sweet malts, chocolate, with a nice roastedness to it. excellent mouthfeel and creamy.....would go back just to have a few more of these.
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"I’m not sure why this is listed as a Baltic Porter... or as a ""Special,"" for that matter, since it’s been on & off tap for some time now. Not bad looking, especially since nitro’ed, a deep ruby body with a creamy tan head. Good lacing. But the nose and flavor are both cloyingly sweet chocolate covered dark caramel. What does that have to do with the style? Or enjoyment? Three Floyds Brewing Company and Brewpub, Munster, IN"
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Poured off the nitro-tap at FFF. I was told that this was an aged version of the first batch. This beer poured a deep brown with ruby highlights around the edges of the glass. A thin, creamy beige head lasted forever. The sides of the glass were totally encompassed in lace. The aroma was made up of dark fruits, chocolate, and a bit of citrus hops. The flavor had a good amount of rasberry and chocolate. Also a good spicy hop finish. Towards the bottom of the glass, a very strong sweet aftertaste seems to take over. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and very creamy. An excellent brew, but the sweetness tends to overwhelm the balance towards the end.
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;rating from memory, on nitro at the FFF brewpup. pours black with creamy tan head. not much in the nose, some grassy hops, light roastiness, subtle caramel. flavors of chocolate, coffee, licorice, molasses, and is pretty sweet. the flavor is rich, smooth, but sorta boring. perhaps the nitro is killing what this beer could be.
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub on 9/29/06: Pours a transparent dark mahogany with a dense, creamy nitro head. Sweet, toasty, malty, but otherwise subtle aroma. Body starts with a sweet, viscous dark maltiness with some earthy milk chocolate and a smooth creamy finish. An enjoyable, fairly complex, Baltic porter.
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;GTMW. Dark brown body with creamy tan head. The aroma is roast, burnt and chocolate. The flavor is semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, roast and figs. Medium/full body with a soft ans smooth texture.
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;9.5 ounce nitro pour at the brewpub. Dark brown with some red highlights. Creamy nitro style head. Aroma of cookies, graham crackers, fruity and chocolate. The flavor is very fruity. Some low levels of chocolate character. Pretty creamy on the palate. It was a good beer, but why the hell are they serving this with nitro?
Three Floyds Red Tendon Baltic Porter;Munster, Indiana, United States;Porter - Baltic;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"GTM ’06 draught. Not much aroma; dry, reminiscent of an old ale or an alt. Dark red, almost opaque. Caskish, thin tan head with an oil slick of tan on top. Must be nitro. Streaks of head on the glass. Flavor is sweet and again, like an alt or old ale. Some smoke. Somewhat Germanic character, but also not all that different from the Baltic porters I’ve had in Russia."
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Imperial Brown;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tyranena Brewing;dark brown w/ medium tan head. Spicy, cherry aromas. Spicy, dark cherry, cocoa, slight resin and hop/alcohol burn. nice change of pace.

Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Imperial Brown;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Light dark brown (if that makes sence) pour w/ a brownish small head and some light lacing. Aroma heavily of carmel and lots of bourbon notes, some definate grahm crackers, then some more bourbon (overdone if you ask me). Plate is pretty avg, some creaminess or maybe just alcohol in the swallow. Flavor was nothing special mostly the barreling that comes through and some real weak beer notes. Not very good.
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Imperial Brown;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Clear dark brown color with a hint of cherry-wood. Small, but stable dark beige head. Bourbon sticky bun aromas. Lots of bourbon and caramel in the nose. Strong bourbon influence throughout. A strong brown, which translates to me as more caramel, with a really heavy dose of bourbon. Very strong with the typical bourbon notes. Even a slight burn in the finish. For me it is lacking malt depth. Perhaps its the style, and this just doesn’t hold the bourbon as well as I had hoped. Too much like a amber with a shot of whiskey in it.
Tyranena Bourbon Barrel Imperial Brown;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Strong Ale - American;Tyranena Brewing;Tap @ GTMW 2006. Semi-hazed and lucid light chestnut in color with saliva wisps to form the head. Caramel and bourbon fondness easily find the nose, teaming with maple syrup and amaretto scented honey graham crackers. Flavor easily transitions into said graham persona, with a mild numbing tingle at the tongue’s tip. Almonds realize a sugary grenadine brethren but bleed out to the bourbon-accented honey suckle rose. Kittle cocktails with bourbon added under the discretion of the house bartender and a hint of caramel cola underlying it all. Most of the roasty and chocolatey accents hang in the background, letting the other aforementioned elements take center stage. Medium-bodied inferences and hazelnut vanilla wafer graham crust comes through in the finish, with a tongue dabble of grenadine emitted as an extra sweet treat.

Roosters Outlaw Nit-Wit;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Roosters Brewing;Cask at Peterborough Beer Fest 2006. Cloudy yellow with a small white head.

Roosters Outlaw Nit-Wit;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Roosters Brewing;"Tasted by half-pint at the White Horse, Parson’s Green, W. London, during its Summer Pale Ale Festival in late July. Appearance: dark honeyish-yellow colour, to...tally cloudy, like scrumpy cider actually; no beer head, static body. Smell: very mild floral hops mixed with a slightly touch of phenol or more exactly, uh, liquidy cleaning agents... guess that’s wheat-malt or wheat? pear-ish (un-peeled) and coriander-ish notes at the back... too timid, but surely hints of wheats are there... Taste: very light-bodied grain-juice with a touch of peaches and citrus-rind, but overly restrained in flavour... turning cleaner in texture as it proceeds to the aftertaste, leaving a grist-like grainy flavour at the back. Not too bad. Palate: for a Witbier, which I suppose it’s brewed to be according to the nose, taste, and the name(!), the texture is quite clean and easily-managed, but overall the flavour is boring and lacking complex flavours. That medicinal note doesn’t add to its advantage, either."

Millrose American Brown Ale;South Barrington, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Millrose Restaurant and Brewing Co.;"All of the brews that I’ve had at this place are watery. This one is called a brown ale, which it is, but is described on the brewpub menu as a ""medium bodied, sweet light amber ale."" I.e., these folks are confused about beer. This one is a light brown, well carbonated concoction with an off-white head that nicely laces the Pilsener glass that it was served in. Not much aroma, some sweet, lightly roasted malts. The flavor is mostly suburban water with a bit of roasted malt flavoring. No hops that I could tell. The finish is wet. Millrose Restaurant and Brewing Company, South Barrington, IL"
Wild Onion Educator Doppelbock;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Onion Brewery;This draft brew from the brew pub poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized light brown colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a semi-opaque dark red brown colored body and a good lacing. .

Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.
Wild Onion Educator Doppelbock;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Wild Onion Brewery;On tap at Onion. Poured a clear deeper reddish-brown with a medium cap of well-retained creamy beige head. Aroma was of sweet, toasty caramel and darker malts, with mild herbal hop presence. Flavor had a heavy focus on dark and toasty caramel and brown sugary malts.. some woody bitterness gets swallowed up by the heavy sweetness.. finish was warm, sweet, and satisfying. Medium-bodied or a hair heavier on the palate.. quite sweet, but grew on me... just the right level of carbonation. Nice one.

The body is a clear golden brown and it’s capped with a creamy beige head. It smells of caramel with lightly roasted malts - all fairly faint. The flavor kicks up a notch, more roasted flavor, more malt sweetness, and a light earthy hopping to balance it out. I questioned the ""doppel"" part of it until the finish when a good nip of alcohol kicked in. I wish this joint would let us in on the ABVs for their brews. I might’ve had another.

Wild Onion Kristal Weiss;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Wild Onion Brewery;A light hefeweizen. Similar in flavor but lighter with a watery texture. Nothing spectacular.
Wild Onion Kristal Weiss;Lake Barrington, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Wild Onion Brewery;This pours a bright, clear yellow body with a sustained, creamy white head. The nose is slightly tart, wheat with a slice of unripe banana. Very soft mouthfeel. The flavor is more that of an American wheat ale, wheat with a slightly bitter graininess that lasts into the finish. I was told by the lady mixologist that this was basically their hefeweizen in a filtered version, but it seems pretty removed from that. Onion Pub & Brewery, Lake Barrington, IL

The weak aroma was malty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt hops and astringent. Not one that I would buy again.
Brass Lunker Light;South Barrington, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brass Restaurant & Brewery;The brewmaster told me that this beer was replacing their regular wheat ale that wasn’t light enough for the brewpub’s BMC crowd. (?!) Not to be confused with their Lunker Lager, this one is admittedly adjunct laden - and it reeks of it. It’s got a strong corn aroma and a strong corn taste with a touch of generic hop bitterness. I’d complain more about the lowering of standards for the crowd that’d be just as happy with a Miller Light, but I got this one for free. Brass Restaurant & Brewery, South Barrington, IL

Flossmoor Station Imperial Mocha Java Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, rating from memory, pours black with tan head. really intense coffee nose. a very nice and rich dark coffee flavor dominate the flavor and causes this to be delicious and way off balanced. very tasty.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Mocha Java Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft: Deep black. Burnt orange foam. Charcoal, burnt toffee, vibrant espresso, seared oak, and hints of campfire smoke fill the nostrils. Soft, fuzzy pricks of carbonation. Delightfully viscous, however. Decadent layers of bitter chocolate and espresso blanket the substantial hoppiness, initially. Espresso continues at full throttle, and expresses a vibrant yet meaty quality which pulls the palate downward with a tug of suppleness. Immense complexity here. Alcohol overexerts itself at the center, as does a subtle vegetal characteristic, but the alcohol is short lived. Dried plums provide a dab of acidity and complement the seemingly endless depth of richness. Molasses and port wine notes contribute more chewiness. Notes of char remain prominent, deepening the fruitiness with a burnt custard and ashen malt overlay. Finishes slightly chewy with yeast, but remarkably flavorsome and multilayered with burnt cookies and charred malts drizzled with melted fudge, dense espresso, and beefy molasses. Overall, the alcohol detracts from some of the more-polished elements of the flavor, and the fuzzy carbonation is the body’s only culprit, as the texture is slightly less than flawless. Still lots to love about this. Another commendable effort.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Mocha Java Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;GABF 2006. Black body. Nose is pure coffee. Dark roasted malts and oily coffee beans. Taste is coffee - dark coffee with oily beans like a French Roast or Espresso. Dark roasted malts and hint of dark, bittersweet chocolate.

On tap at the brewery on 10/21/2006 at the 2nd monthly meeting of the Chicago Ratebeer group. Tan brown head, body is totally black. Nose is super huge and strong can be easily felt and smelled when you walk by someone with this beer. Full of coffee with just a hint of cream. Taste is full of coffee grounds then with more coffee beans. Very strong full malty backbone and the alcohol. Oh my friend, there is pleanty of that all over the place. Awesome.
Flossmoor Station Imperial Mocha Java Stout;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Imperial;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Enjoyed at the monthly Chicagoland gathering and served in a snifter: Completely opaque with a small frothy tan head and shows excellent lace. The nose displays espresso, bittersweet chocolate, burnt and roasted malts, plum and earthy yeast esters. The taste comes forth with a big espresso characteristic that is very bitter and roasted with a minor background of acidic fruit twang and a sweeter chocolate finish. The finish is moderately smoky and ashy with some alcoholic bite. The mouth feel is oily and creamy as well with a smoothness that comforts and has a cleansing light alcohol nature, the aftertaste is ashy and has that espresso overtone lingering about. This is one solid Impy but could a hint of more body then it would truly rock. It once again it appears the coffee makes the body seem thinner. I can not wait to try this on wood next weekend at FoBAB!

There was a hint of haze in the body while the head was snowy white. The aroma was a lot of bread with bell peppers, some Saaz hops and chewing gum. The taste was funky cheese with Saaz and some abc gum. There was also a hint of oatmeal. Yes, I know the style, that is what I tasted. Very smooth with the carbonation. Another solid lager from a solid brewpub.

Lost Duck Pintail Pale Ale;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lost Duck Brewing Company;Medium copper with a white head. Malty with a little bit of oranges. The taste is woody and nasty with some old watered down orange juice. There is a strange smoke note. I noticed this same strange smoky taste in their IPA. A little bizzarre. Earlier Rating: 8/15/2006 Total Score: 3.1 Sampled at the brewpub. The body was a fairly hazy medium gold. The aroma had oranges with some fresh ground wheat. There was also a hint of leather. The taste was bread crust withalmonds. There was also some decent toffee. The carbonation was a little sharp, but I thought it added to the nice mouthfeel. Decent.
Lost Duck Pintail Pale Ale;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lost Duck Brewing Company;When I was at the Duck, this was called Pintail Pale Ale, a new recipe. From the tap, sampled at the proper cooler cellar temperature in a pint glass. A new recipe APA from the Duck that I had to try. Poured a clear reddish orangey golden with a foamy white head that settled into a fine lacing. Aromas of citrus and dry leafs, sweet cereal grains and a hint of butter. Moderate carbonation overall and a softly crisp, dryish, watery, thin light bodied mouthfeel. Disappointing thin, watery taste, watery citrus rind, not very pleasing, earthy leafiness that provides only hop bite, but the bitterness is so soft and watery that if you were in the brewpub with a bunch of smokers, you would have a hard time finding it, thin, thin, sweet cereal grainy malts, a watery backing, and a finish that has some dryness to it, but the watery, washed out hop and malt flavors doesn’t utilize it. Washed out hops and thin malts leads to a APA I won’t be trying again.
Lost Duck Pintail Pale Ale;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Lost Duck Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden color with lasting white head that left some lace. Light citrusy hop and malty cereal grain aroma. Sweet maltiness on the tongue. The malt flavor is a bit overwhelming and unfortunately smothers the delicate hops that linger in the background. There is a touch of brown sugar flavor that lingers.

Qvänum McBrian Summer Ale;Kvänum, Sweden;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Qvänum Mat & Malt;Draught at the brewpub. Hazy roast brown, rich creamy head. Aroma of butter, peat and toffee. Sweet, soft and lightly woody. Medium bodied with some spun sugar and butterscotch, and lots of chocolate. Light flowery bitterness that grows with time. The brewer is constantly changing the recipe and altering the beer. I also got to try a newer batch, still not fully mature. This batch had a shorter time on oak barrels, clocking in at 5.8%. Being much younger it was more fruity and sparkling, and less malty and woody. Both of the beers were interesting and tasty, although a bit rustic. A visit to the brewery restaurant is highly recommended!

Mikkeller Black Hole;Copenhagen, Denmark;Stout - Imperial;Mikkeller;Wow, what a label, and then I saw Mikkeller and that it was a stout of some kind. Obtained at an upscale beer shop in Santa Fe in October, it is getting the try tonight. I selected my New Belgium tulip for the tasting. The lid comes off and I make the pour out of a 12.7 oz bottle. The body is coal black with a resolute light-to-medium tan skim of foam, The scent is strong licorice, sour dough bread and blackberry, all good. But I am here for the drink. Heavy on the malt, quickly a berry sweetness, oatmeal, cracker, light chocolate and firmly bitter at the end. Not as viscous as other imperial stouts but that is not a bother, just an observation. A very good effort, not a favorite.

On the nose were floral hops, some fruity notes, and a hint of sweet malt. Flavors were too sweet, with a hint of apple, and some weird honey. Light bodied, watery and no carbonation. Finished sweet, with a weird fruity aftertaste. Not really a pale ale, but wasn’t that bad actually, but there was something not right. It was reduced to clear, so that might have something to do with it, otherwise it would have been way overpriced.

I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Im Glas schauts gelb und sogar leicht rötlich aus, mit einer fein-mittelporigen, kleinen Krone. Es prickelt sehr schön und weiß zu gefallen. Beim Geruchstest kommen hauptsächlich Hopfenaromen durch. Der Antrunk ist zuerst dezent hopfig, sehr würzig und gut rezent.

Treiber Export;Pfungstadt, Hesse, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Pfungstädter Brauerei Hildebrand;Das Export strotzt nur so von Wössrigkeit, ein herb-blechernes Aroma ist darunter feststellbar. Dieses ist jedoch so schwach, dass die Vermutung nahe liegt, dass an der Menge der Zutaten gespart wurde. Das Aroma wird im Laufe des Mittelteil etwas stärker, jedoch nicht angenehmer, da der Ton weiterhin plörrig wirkt. Das Pils kann mich noch halbwegs überzeugen, bei dem Export sind Hopfen und Malz (sofern sie denn verwendet wurden) verloren.

Bell's Cherry Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Bourbon and nougat nose, faint cherry and even fainter charred oak. Black, thin tan head. Tart black currant and prune. Medium body, easy carbonation. Not nearly as good as the non-barrel aged version.
Bell's Cherry Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Pours very dark with an insinuation of a thin foam ring. Aroma is far subtler than I expected. The notes I anticipated are there, coffee, bourbon, cherries ... but it’s so mild that I struggle to discern much. The barrel notes are there on the flavor, and some tart cherries. Plus there are mild herbal/licorice notes. But like the aroma, the aroma isn’t at all aggressive. On another day I might love this beer. Today I think it’s only OK.
Bell's Cherry Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;Good complexity - dark, wild cherry aromas, with bourbon, chocolate, coffee and dried fruit aromas.

Bell's Cherry Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Flavored;Bell's Brewery;"12oz bottle from Steve's in Fitchburg, cellared 2 months and poured into the Civil Society snifter at cellar temperature. Almost black pour with a brown head that rapidly faded. Aroma has barrel, sweet malts and black cherries. Taste is of sweet malts, whiskey, tart cherries, other fruit and some roastiness. The taste is more dimensional than the barrel from the nose. Medium to full bodied, not falling into that ""all barrel, no depth"" trap. The blend is pretty good and there is a bit of an alcohol presence. Finishes sweetly, with a touch of tartness. This is a solid, tasty, sipper of a brew. 14.8"

Grizzly Paw Burrowing Badger Summer Ale;Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;I tried this as part of an 8 beer tasting tray at the pub. The tasting tray is an excellent value, featuring Big Head brown, Grumpy Bear Wheat, Powder Hound pilsener, Rutting Elk red, Beavertail Raspberry, Randy Goat pilsener, and two seasonal brews that are new: Bloody Hell Pale Ale and Burrowing Badger Summer Ale. This one was a light golden with a modest white head. Slightly fruity hop nose, with a palate of pale malt and modest hop character. This was not a standout among the beers I tried. As far as the two seasonals, I thought that the Bloody Hell was more interesting and I ended up ordering a full pint of it instead of the Badger.
Grizzly Paw Bloody Hell Pale Ale;Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery, part of a sampler. This was a refreshing break from the fairly mediocre beers in the sampler, the best of the bunch, a moderately hopped pale ale, light and crisp
Grizzly Paw Bloody Hell Pale Ale;Canmore, Alberta, Canada;Pale Ale - English;Grizzly Paw Brewing Company;"This may be the same beer that has recently been listed by ""dkoonce"", however I am certain that it is not characterized as an IPA, since I spoke at length with the bartender/assisstant brewmaster about this beer. It also is not a true English pale ale, nor a true American pale ale. It’s existence came about entirely by mistake when the brewmaster was making a batch of the Rutting Elk Red and accidently left out the crystal malt (this is why it is called ""Bloody Hell!""-- get it?). The result is a pale malt ale with a moderately rich hop profile that doesn’t quite fall into any category. I tried this as part of an 8 beer tasting tray at the pub. The tasting tray is an excellent value, featuring Big Head brown, Grumpy Bear Wheat, Powder Hound pilsener, Rutting Elk red, Beavertail Raspberry, Randy Goat pilsener, and two seasonal brews that are new: Bloody Hell Pale Ale and Burrowing Badger Summer Ale. As far as the two seasonals, I thought that the Bloody Hell was more interesting and I ended up ordering a full pint of it instead of the Badger. A beguiling hop profile with moderately bitter finish, plays more towards the classic English-style pale ale than any other in my opinion."

Triple Rock Hop O the Rock;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;IPAX on cask, drank a pint of this today on the day of this review. As IPAX is one of Triple Rock’s best brews, this is a great one to try on cask as well. As long as the cask hasn’t been sitting there oxidizing too long - unfortunately the cask brews at triple rock are sometimes hit and miss. Today it was pretty damn good. A low carbonation, 55F version of IPAX. Dangerously drinkable, and very enjoyable.
Triple Rock Hop O the Rock;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;Cask. Hazy amber beer with a nice whitish head. Grapefruit aroma.

Persha Avtorske;Lviv, Ukraine;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Persha Pryvatna Brovarnya (Oasis Beverages);"Das Avtorske ist ein Bockbier, das nichts anderes heißt als ""Autorenbier"", also sowas wie ""nach Braumeisterart"". Es ist dabei recht stark und der Alkohol kommt gemeinsam mit einer Zuckersäure, die aromatisch aber weniger hergibt. Es ist nicht ganz so übel wie mancher frühere, osteuropäische Bock, aber eine wirkliche Freude mag nicht aufkommen. Dafür fehlt es einfach an Fruchtigkeit und Aromentiefe."

Medium carbonation visually. Watery texture with soft fizz. Aroma is cereal, grains, sweet corn, sweet caramel, hints of wet cardboard. Taste is the same. Disgustingly sweet. Fake caramel mixed with sweet corn, poor cereals and wet cardboard notes. Alcohol is well integrated, at least. This wants to be a serious beer but I'm laughing.

Wigram Hefe Weizen;Christchurch, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wigram Brewing Company;This rating is based on a past experience, serving this beer on tap a few years ago. It was an immediate favourite and remarkably easy to recommend. There were overt aromas and flavours of banana, clove and bubblegum and this was reflected in the flavours as well. It poured hazy yellow-straw colour and the head was short lived, but it was a deserved favourite with my customers. It sat nicely within the style guidelines. A simple, uncomplicated thirst quencher.

Wigram Hefe Weizen;Christchurch, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wigram Brewing Company;...bottle into weizen glass. Had a nice fluffy white head that lasted all the way down with lacing. On the nose was mainly wheat and yeast, with a touch of citrus. Smooth and yeasty, great sediment in the bottle, very hazy with chunks, which I like. Finished smooth, with mainly a wheat and yeast note, and slight citrus. Solid effort, worth a try.
Wigram Hefe Weizen;Christchurch, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wigram Brewing Company;Bottle. Very hazy, dirty yellow-brown with a brief small white head. By midway through, there was no head at all. Looks like an amateur home brew! Aroma is slightly sour, estery, with some banana fruit and faint spices. The palate is quite zesty, and despite the lack of a head, there is decent carbonation. The driving flavour is tart lemon with notes of banana, mild esters, and very mild spices. Finish is short and slightly tart. This played out more as an American style wheat in my mind. Not one I’d reach for again.
Wigram Hefe Weizen;Christchurch, New Zealand;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wigram Brewing Company;Draught. Pours hazy golden with small white head. Aroma and flavour of wheat, banana, butter and yeast. Low carbonation and average bitterness.

Der Geruch ist leicht künstlich nach Limetten. Gut gekühlt ist der Antrunk leicht süßlich, aber für mich nicht so penetrant. Hauptteil wird etwas herber, sowohl von der Limette als auch vom Bier. Der Nachgeschmack schmeckt zwar eindeutig nach Chemie-Süßstoff + Chemie-Limetten, aber gut gekühlt ist das auch zu ertragen - und ein Biermischgetränk ohne Süßstoff findet man leider nicht so häufig - ich weiß nicht, was die Leute an diesen Chemie-Aromen schätzen... --> Ist gut gekühlt sehr gut, auch auf Grund von seiner Süffigkeit, trinkbar. Nicht gerade das non plus ultra, aber doch noch ""im guten 3er Bereich""... (Test vom 8.5.2008) --> 9,7,12,6,12,9 - 8,85"

Pfungstädter 1:1 Bier-Lemon-Mix;Pfungstadt, Hesse, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Pfungstädter Brauerei Hildebrand;"The bottle (a Becks-bottle) looks good. The beer in the glass looks terrible. Toxic green, not much foam. Very dry aroma. Tastes chemical, modest fruity, dry finish. A terrible ""beer""."
Pfungstädter 1:1 Bier-Lemon-Mix;Pfungstadt, Hesse, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Pfungstädter Brauerei Hildebrand;Pervers sieht das Bier schon aus, fast wie ein atomverseuchtes Objekt in Zeichentrikfilmen. Wie kaum anders zu erwarten riecht das Bier süß, Süßstoff läst sich schon erschnüffeln. Übermäßig süß ist das Bier schon im Antrunk, im Nachgeschmack wird das Ganze noch gesteigert. Bier ist natürlich nicht zu erkennen. Dieses Zeug is ganz klar eine Katastrophe.

Banana ester is very light, sweetness is quite strong in the middle. Quite spicy and earthy bready yeast. Moderate sweetness, clove and phenol iis moderate. Low lemon to round. Alright… Hoppiness is cinnamon, light lemon and light grass in nose and taste; Bitterness is low for an abrupt, very low-astringent sweet and dark malty finish; Quite dry after taste. Smooth and easy to mouth. Comments: Like its Hefe Hell brother, this Dunkelweiss has really impressive looks, creamy feel, and fun to sniff cocoa and marshmallows to hide its weak roastyness. Yet the rather brand taste renders it another “one of the crowds"". Drinkable no doubt, but it’s all thunders with little rain."

Appearance is a clear amber gold hue, with one finger of white froth, which recedes to a thin ring.

Aroma of big oaky bourbin, and a plethora of fruit, including peahces, pears, apple, apricot, and melon.

Brown's Oatmeal Stout;Troy, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Brown's Brewing Company;I’ll have to agree that the presentation/appearance of this stout beer is lacking... though of course color is nice & dark there’s almost zero foam aka “cranium” (HHH) post-can pour into pint glass. Flavors are quite appropriate for the style, however, and I’ll add that lowish price & reliable availability contribute to my rating once again. Solid effort from NY state.

Stone 20th Anniversary Encore Series: 10th Anniversary IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;9/26/2016 -- from notes: 22oz bottle, from Dutch's. Bottled 8/18/16. Shared with Steph S. Clear darker orange color. Thin off-white head. Leaves some good bubbles and bits of lace. Kind of more of a carmelly malt, but has a nice big resiny piney hop burn to it all around. Moderate-plus sweet taste, moderate to bigger bitterness, with a nice hoppy alcohol warmth pushing the aftertaste in the back end. Bigger body, mild slick texture. Nice one to enjoy with my sandwich.
Stone 20th Anniversary Encore Series: 10th Anniversary IPA;Escondido, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Stone Brewing;From Sep 2006 Poured from 22oz bottle a clear reddish gold with a lot of bubbles and a huge head of foam that shrinks slowly until there's a solid layer with lots of lacing. Very attractive DIPA in my glass indeed! The smell is a big hit of hops and spices with a side of malt sweetness. It leaves me shaking my head and saying, inaudibly, that this is gonna be a very tasty brew... The taste is nothing short of BIG on super bitterness from the hops *and* BIG on super caramel sweetness from the malt. I *really* can't seperate the 2 and say that one is dominant over the other and...that makes for some really tasty goodness for my palate as I'm a big fan of both really hoppy and really malty beers. And the 10% abv is merely a statistic, imho. This one is *very* drinakable. Ahh...I think Stone has done themselves proud with this 10th Anniversary IPA. And I'm *so* glad that I made the effort to get some. Damn good stuff!! Bottom line: I'd have to rank *this* one amongst the best of the style I've tried to date. See some? Get some!

Fruity flavor but clean and restrained, dried mango, green banana and starfruit, some ’dim’ sourishness underneath, medium carbo, supple and bit soapy mouthfeel. Cereally and mildly biscuity malt backbone, long aromatic finish, grapefruity and floral with minerally side notes, biscuity juiciness remains for a long time afterwards, as well as something glueishly resinous.

McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;20061007 Tap at Kennett 06. Liked this one quite a bit. Medium brown with much head, thick and tan. Smoky tobacco and distant forest fire. Full, sticky body, rich and savory. Complex and sweet with nice mingling of smoke and dark honey malts. Finishes with more nuttiness, sticky, dark toffee, lingering. Delicious - I’m a sucker for smoky doppelbocks.
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;Pour was a hazy copper/brown color with a clingy, off-white head. Aroma is dry smoke and a little roasted malts. Flavors are smoke, dry oak, toast, roasted malts, with subtle but sweet grapes in the finish.
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;KSBF 06. Pours a deep woody amber, slight haze, and an awesome sticky tight off white head. Aroma is campfire smoke, sweet and caramelly with some chocolate, smoked salted meats, and some light plasticy phenols. More meaty smoke and woody burnt malts in the flavor with a slight saltiness, sweet caramel malts. Full mouthfeel and sticky sweet. Good toasty smoky almond lingering finish. Real smooth.
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;"Draught samples at Kennett Fest, 10/7/06 Very frothy, large, aerated head is a light cappucino color, providing excellent, sticky lace down the glass. Medium to medium-high retention. Tobacco/maple brown body shows low clarity and has some rust and beige tints. Dry smoke in the nose is not overly meaty (salt, bacon, sausage) relative to a Schlenkerla, but shows a more reserved woodsmoke/tobacco/char aroma. Medium dry chocolate malt notes are intersparsed, delightfully, with dry coffee-like roast and soft vanilla-toffee hints. A very faint note of yellow raisins can even be found on the finish. Medium to medium-high strength of aroma, with no alcohol apparency. Very dry for a doppelbock, with some hints of lager yeast on the finish. Clean and properly lagered. Dry chocolate and coffee bean crunchiness initially strips the palate, and only gradually is a light vanilla-cream and raisin-like sweetness added back. With warming, some base malts mix with the chocolate malts but also mingle with the oak-hickory-like smokiness and do not fully sweeten. Tobacco and some breadiness (perhaps paperiness) sit on the end, dryly, while light raisin and vanilla chewiness collects. A fair amount of acidity (smoked malt and/or dark malt phenol?) definitely builds up as well, unfortunately, and somewhat distracts from the drinkability (but does add an interesting dark berry-skin note). Carbonation is a bit loose and the beer has moments of wateriness on the finish. But even if the palate/mouthfeel are not quite up to par, the array of flavors and utter lack of any brewing flaws certainly wins back support. Yeast presence is low; some sparkle of lager yeast crispness is evident on the finish, but is minimal."
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;Poured a ruby-light brownish in color, decent head for the style, average lacing. The aroma was raisins, some dough, and roasted malts. The flavor was raisins first, as well as some American hoppiness (pineapples and grapefruits, interesting in this style). As temperature increased, some coffee notes came out. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and acidic, somewhat of an astringent note. An intersting take on the style, but not my cup of tea.
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;Draft @ KSBF:06 Poured a medium sized tan head, fair retention with some small spotty lace. Slightly Murky, brown colored brew. Aroma was light smoke, roast and a light, dark fruitiness. Body was medium, lightly oily on the palate. Flavors pretty much mirror the aromas with some yeasty, bready notes and some buttery flavors as well. Finish is lightly smokey and roasty, lightly sweet malts. Uneventful.
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;On tap at the KSBF ’06. This was my most anticipated beer of the festival. Hazy light brown color with a medium sized beige head. Mild smoke aroma with some caramel malt and doughy bread. Smoke came out a bit more in the flavor, but was still mild. Other flavors were brown sugar, whole grain bread and a bit of banana. Nice full, creamy mouthfeel.
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;KSBF 2006. Lightly hazy copper body with a frothy beige head. Peaty impression in the aroma, like an earthy, muddy campfire in the rain. Also has sweet toffee and cooked banana notes. Somewhat sticky with lingering smoke flavors that merge with a plastic phenolic quality and some woody hops. Good, not great.
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;On tap at KSBF ’06... Appears a hazed, amber toned brown with a small, bone colored tan head that slowly fades out and leaves hearty lacing around the glass. Smell is of caramel, smoked malt, cocoa, along with a meaty, and creamy vanilla aroma that is very nice. Taste is of the given aromas with a gentle smoked nuttiness that caresses the caramel flavors from the brewed grain. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium-full bodied, along with a caramel roastiness that does the brew justice.
McKenzie Fünf;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;McKenzie Brew House;On tap at Kennett. Dark reddish copper brown in color with a nice fluffy off white head. Malty caramel smokey aroma. Grainy. Toffee caramel smokey flavor. Roasty notes. Smokey and sweet tasting. Smooth. Finish is smokey. Full bodied. Very nice. Enjoyable.

Dogfish Head Red & White;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogfish Head Brewery;"750 ml bottle to snifter (shared with the Mrs.). Looks solid; a fairly cloudy burnt orange with off-white head. Smells like a witbier on steriod with ample notes of Belgian yeast, orange peel, and coriander alongside a notable oak and grape must presence. Tastes like it smells, but more orange peel and coriander-forward. Mouthfeel is medium full-bodied and mildly bitter. Underwhelming. I remember it being better fresh, but I also liked witbiers more back then."

Dogfish Head Red & White;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogfish Head Brewery;Tap at gravity. Golden orange with small head. Just a tad tart. Listed as a wit on the menu, definitely not that. Fruity grape and mild boozy hit. Wine barrel influence is mild. Interesting complexity and enjoyable, but not sure I’d seek this out again.
Dogfish Head Red & White;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogfish Head Brewery;750mL bottle. Pours caramel with a medium off-white head. Aroma is wine, oak, orange, wheat, and yeast. Taste is wine, alcohol, orange, spice, caramel, and oak. A touch of yeast. Medium body. Soft carbonation. Smooth, slick, and slightly creamy mouthfeel. This really isn’t much like a witbier, but is very interesting. King of reminds me of Midas Touch.

Dogfish Head Red & White;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogfish Head Brewery;From a bomber. Pours a dark, almost opaque orange and makes a thick off-white head. A bit of lacing follows the liquid down the glass. Aroma is of oak, Pinot Noir, and malted barley. Tastes of Belgian yeast, coriander, and malt. This is a great beer and a unique taste profile. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Dogfish Head Red & White;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogfish Head Brewery;Really good beer. Super easy finish with nice present fruity flavors, the Pinot noir really comes through, but the corriander and oak keep things balanced. Good beer
Dogfish Head Red & White;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogfish Head Brewery;2013 750 ml bottle Aroma: mostly fruity aroma with stale green apples (oxidation shows up here), vinousy notes, and lots of spices included the expected coriander. Appearance: pour a pale/medium amber with a thin off-white head that has decent retention. mostly clear as it warms but there is some visible sediment. no lacing observed. Flavor: a lot of caramelly sweetness, vinousy overtones and oak. earthy hop flavors are minimal but bitterness is significant to mostly balance. Palate: rich, creamy almost chewy texture, medium body, almost on the full side. carbonation is light and lacking a bit (shows age here as well). a mild astringency is present. Finishes sweetish, vinousy with a long lasting astringency and hints of alcohol. Overall: didn’t know what to expect here as far as cellaring. its an aged 10% abv beer. it was never a favorite of mine when fresh but its held out pretty well.
Dogfish Head Red & White;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogfish Head Brewery;Fantastic. Perhaps the best I’ve ever had. This brewery did everything it set out to do with marrying the wit with the wine. A taste of balanced grape and honey and carbonation.
Dogfish Head Red & White;Milton, Delaware, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Dogfish Head Brewery;Half growler. Light haze on the orange-amber brew topped by a film of spit. Toasted wheat, rye, citrus, cocoa and bubblegum aroma. Tastes of bubblegum, spicy tripel yeast, earthy potato bread, cocoa and citrus. Medium-heavy body has a dry slant and low-medium carbonation.
Breavoine Domaine du Lieu Gosset Poire de Normandie;Coudray Rabut, France;Perry;Domaine du lieu Gosset / Michel Breavoine;75cl bottle from Auchan. Pours pale greenish yellow.

East End The Ugly American;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;East End Brewing Company;From notes: pours a dark hazy golden yellowish orange color with burnt orange hues when held to anlight and a frothy 1.5 finger white head that quickly fades into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lace left behind. Crisp golden fruit aroma with hints of apple, pear and grape balanced by earthy, floral hops, pale malt and champagne like yeast. Estery frui notes and sweet alcohol phenol dominate the nose. Fuller bodied than expected with surprisingly prominent malt backbone and subtle creamy presence. This helps balance out the sweet alcohol flavor and crisp light fruit notes. There is an unexpected earthy hop character that countered the sweet apple, pear and grape notes. Very well balanced with sweet alcohol flavor but not much heat at all. An interesting interpretation of the style.
East End The Ugly American;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;East End Brewing Company;Poured into a snifter from the big ass 33.8 oz bottle. 3.0 A: Opaque brownish orange color. One finger of soapy head with less poor retention and some lacing. 4.5 S: Smells more like a farmhouse ale than a tripel. Hay-like funk off the top. Not as hoppy as I would have expected, but there is a healthy hit of citrusy hops. Overripe peaches and spicy, peppery yeast. 4.5 T: Taste is also saison like. Overripe fruit such as peaches, pears, and funk. Belgian spicy yeastiness with pepper and clove. Hops aren’t present very much, but there is a healthy bitterness (much more so than a regular tripel). With every additional sip, I switch between thinking this is a tripel or a saison. 3.5 M: Medium body. A little under-carbonation (even for the style) and smooth. Slight alcoholic bite, which complements. 4.5 D: This is a shitty IPA, a good tripel, and a great saison mixed into one. Very drinkable if you’re down with funk, which I am.

East End The Ugly American;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;East End Brewing Company;Brewed a second time for election season! Batch #2 This is from the fresh 2008 batch just released on Saturday! Poured from the 1L bottle into my snifter. A-Body is a foggy orange/light amber hue that pours with a small (1/2 finger) foamy white head that quickly subsides to a thin collar. No lacing left behind in the glass. Brew is moderately uniformly cloudy with some sediment floating in the bottom. S-Perfect scent for a crazy collaboration of DIPA/Trippel. Belgian candy sugar and sweet, bready yeast come through first followed by a healthy offering of citrusy hops. T- Lots of citrusy juicy hop flavor upfront with a solid sweet, bready yeast and candy sugar backbone. The finish shows evidence of its freshness with a good dose of alcohol astringency and a bit of resiny hop bitterness...but these disappear quickly. All that lingers is a bit of alcohol warmth. P-Good...but could be better. Medium carbonation and a balanced body of alcohol astringency and smooth yeast. The third character is hop oils but not as strong as it could be (would be perfect if hop oils were most prominent instead of vaguely noticeable). O- Great, Unique beer. My dilemma was to age or not to age? If one ages the clear alcohol astringency of the beer is lowered and the yeast has a chance to thrive and effect the flavor and mouthfeel...but the wonderful hop flavors...are gone. I drank this one fresh. I really liked this collaboration of two of my favorite styles-who happen to be opposites. I will try to buy a few more bottles of this to experiment with. My only complaint is that it could be a bit more hoppy. Very well done though. Great beer! I was super-excited when I found out it was being re-released!

East End The Ugly American;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;East End Brewing Company;A: Pours a cloudy yellow with a puffy white head. Okay retention and a few spots of lace. S: Aroma of Belgian yeast, spice, and banana. Light citrus as well. T: Very much like the aroma. Lots of yeast and spice. The banana stands out as well along with some candy sugar. The citrus comes out mildly in the finish. It is more Belgian than IPA M: Medium in body, pretty smooth. D: An average american version of the style.
East End The Ugly American;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;East End Brewing Company;Bottle: &nbsp Dark straw, dull and hazy, large frothy white head, lots of sediment showing up on this one. &nbsp Heavy bready nose. &nbsp Felt a bit more Belgian but as it warmed it became much more American in its heaviness. &nbsp Seems somewhat bright. &nbsp Certainly more hoppy than your average Triple. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Does seem a bit heavy tho. &nbsp Decent, but rather American like. &nbsp Wished it were more floral. &nbsp Just a heavy heavily hopped American Triple. &nbsp Not bad but, not as delicate as I would have wanted. &nbsp Thanks Trey!
East End The Ugly American;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;East End Brewing Company;Courtesy of tpd975. Pours cloudy copper with a bit of tiny floaties and nice white head. The modest aroma brings a few malty notes mixing with apricot, oxidized prunes, spice and a bit of grassy to piney hops. The taste starts with a pleasing mix of grapefruit, pine and then apricot fruitiness. Midway the malts show up just pushing aside the other flavors enough to get noticed. Nice brew.
East End The Ugly American;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;East End Brewing Company;Thanks tpd975 for the share. Pours hazy yellow with a white head. Nose is yeast, bitterness, banana, some malt, and some funk/ vinegar. Flavor is the same with some sugar and a fairly noticeable banana-ness. Medium-bodied and pretty nice.

East End The Ugly American;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;East End Brewing Company;This is from the fall 2008 batch, and as such, the hops have not mellowed much at all. This is a hoppy ass brew. Looks great, a nice golden color with a crown of head that releases scents of pine and sugar. On an aside, what a great label. Taste is very similar to the smell, though the hops are definitely the prevailing factor. With that said, it isn’t such a crazy amount of hops that it puts this brew off balance, but I wouldn’t recommend hop-averse or hop-newbies start here. Mouthfeel is strong with a medium body and carbonation. The flavor is enhanced rather than overshadowed here. Drinkability is good but a fair warning: this one will sneak up on you. A very good brew.
Ramstein Alt;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;High Point Brewing Company;Draft. Wow, awful. Smelled and tasted like a badly executed rauchbier gone terribly wrong.
Ramstein Alt;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;High Point Brewing Company;on tap-pours a thin foamy light tan head and brown color. Aroma is mild medium/dark malt-some sweet. Taste is medium/dark malt-toffee, nutty, hint of/slight hops to balance this beer out nicely. OK carbonation.
Ramstein Alt;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;High Point Brewing Company;Tap and Spuyten Duyvil - I wasn’t going to rate this beer, but I just have to because I thought it tasted so damn wierd! - it sure looked nice, with a deep amber color and a compact, lasting white head - smelled very earthy and vegetable-like, with aromas of fruit-flavored yogurt and freshly-baked bread - earthy, plant-like flavor, with bread yeast, melon rinds, yogurt - my tongue didn’t know what to do with this stuff - I’m still trying to figure it out, and I had it about 24 hours ago - it won’t leave my brain alone!
Ramstein Alt;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;High Point Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: This balanced Altbier presents leafy, earthy hops joyously walking alongside the malt’s nutty caramel. A competent recreation of this flavorful session style. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy head decorates the hazy caramel-tinged copper. -The aroma does not necessarily announce the high flavor content, especially its length. -This finish is well balanced, offering as much caramel maltiness as wooden, earthy, and grassy hop bitterness. -Carbonation suits the flavor profile and body quite well. -I would not have expected less from High Point. On tap at Tap NY.
Ramstein Alt;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;High Point Brewing Company;Pours an nice shade of brown (yeah, I know, whatever that is?) with the obligatory tan-ish head. Flavor is traditional for an Alt, yet it somehow finished bitter than expected, even though there wasn’t much in the way of hops with the initial. Decent brew.
Ramstein Alt;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;High Point Brewing Company;Brewtopia NYC (2006). Pours an amber/light brown with a tan decent head. Malty aroma.

Ramstein Alt;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;High Point Brewing Company;Bottle courtesy of Luiss. Thank you, sir. very light grassy hop aroma with notes of lemon peper and sweet bread. Body is ruddy brown and holds a tight, pinky thickness, tan head that dimishes slowly. Fore is a kind of a hearty plain bread and cotton cloth flavor with sweeter maltiness throught he middle and hints of brown ale like nuttiness in the finish. finish is vaugely dusty, but satisfying too. Presentsas a dry, less fruity, brown ale with a slight dusty funkiness that gives it some depth.
Ramstein Alt;Butler, New Jersey, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;High Point Brewing Company;Thanks to dickinsonbeer for this... Appears a dark, transparent mahogany with a small off white head that quickly fades out. Tiny speckles of lacing is left around the glass. Smell is of toffee, doughy malt, chocolate, green hops, dark fruit, nuts, and caramel. Taste is of the same aromas. There is almost a prune presence found in the flavors as well that is typical of a Belgian Dubbel but not necessarily an altbier. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary, with raisins, and cocoa mixed with sugar lingering along the palate.
Prairie Rock Belgian Style Ale;Elgin, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Prairie Rock Brewing Company;Curiously named, I suppose to dumb it down for the uneducated, this actually is a fairly respectable Belgian Wit. It poured a hazy, light straw color with a modest head that did some decent lacing. The aroma is a tart wheat with orange peel, coriander, and orange pulp quite evident. Thick for the style, it has a refreshing wit taste, soft wheat with coriander and orange zest and a lightly tart finish. A pleasant surprise. Prairie Rock Brewing Company, Elgin, IL

Davids Ale Works Sprocket Blonde Ale;Diamond Springs, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Davids Ale Works;A fairly weak attempt at a blonde ale here. There was corn in the nose, a sweetness that was also very prominent and not much else going on. Appearance was a light yellow in color, minimal haed. Mouthfeel was light and crisp. Flavor was really off with a strong buttery/diacytl very prominent. I could get notes of hops too but they were very faint. Best I could say about this beer is it was wet. Not much else.
Davids Ale Works Sprocket Pale Ale;Diamond Springs, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Davids Ale Works;Surely, I’ve had worse beers out of a can than this. But those are usually the mass produced, lager stuff we all know and love. But this is probably the worst pale ale out of a can I’ve come across. This is a very unbalanced beer in both the nose and palate. Aroma was slightly peppery and vegetable. Appearance was a very dark copper color. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and unremarkable. Flavor was peppery, sweetly malted and very little hops to taste. Way to malty for a pale ale and not enough hops.
Columbus Brewing 90 Shilling Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Bottle from friar tucks, pours clear dark red, aroma of brown sugar and malts. Flavor is roasted nuts and some caramel, asweet, but a litle bitter on the end.
Columbus Brewing 90 Shilling Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Enjoyed on tap in a shaker glass. The beer poured a medium copper color, with a low off-white head. The nose showed pleasant caramel and toffee notes, with perhaps a very low level of yeast-derived esters in the background, if they existed at all. The palate was pleasantly malty, lacking the semi-astringent roasted character and thin mouthfeel that accompanies many variants of the style. Again, caramel, honey, toffee, and perhaps a touch of date come through. Extremely enjoyable. Overall, a very good example of an oft-poorly brewed style. It’s difficult to see where many other raters found so much fault.
Columbus Brewing 90 Shilling Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;I poured the bottle into a small snifter and it produced a small cream colored head that faded fast with no lace after it left. The body of the brew was a nice shade of orange. The beer started to fall apart from here. The aroma was more roast than malty not what I expect at all, and I got no peat note from this at all. The flavors were more roasted malts than sweet caramel. It was more bitter than earthy as well so the bittering just didn’t work. The feel was ok for the style with good carbonation for your tongue. I finished the bottle but it was nothing close to what I wanted to see for the style.
Columbus Brewing 90 Shilling Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;"Bottle sample at the Hill Distributing tasting at Blacklick Wine & Spirits on 5/13/10.

Columbus Brewing 90 Shilling Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Scottish Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;12oz from BeerVirgin72 - thanks, Dawn! Bright amber pour with a moderate head. Very intense caramel notes in the nose, which tapers off to be a bit one-dimensional (even if that single dimension is enticing). Slightly thin mouthfeel and lively carbonation, but the flavor is really quite nice. Soft and bready, with a hint of smoke to balance the sweet flavors.

Big Buck Mondello Mexican Lager;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Big Buck Brewery;"5 oz draught sample at the Gaylord, MI location, July 2006. Very dark amber with quite a bit of lace as the small creamy head recedes quite slowly....faintly spicy with cacao and a trace of cinnamon, lots of toasted grains, some corn perhaps in the mix....the body is lovely, smoky toasty malts making for a rich mouthfeel, moderately sweet at the front and creamy-smooth but heading towards spicy territory at the finish with a bit of pepper and again, cinnamon....coffee notes start to show up with warmth; moderate to low carbonation. This was really interesting, just could have been a bit more forceful and it might have touched greatness, but as is a very nice surprise."

Colour was a very deep amber, reminiscent of cognac. No head. Hands down one of the best aged beers I've had.

H. Livinusbier;Ertvelde, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;"Pale amber-orange ale; small yellowish head. Wet dog, rotting wood, moulded malts. Again something rotten in the taste, as well as sweet malts superimposed by a rather harsh bitterness, not really hoppy. Drier finish. Slick, but rather thin. Ugh. Retrial with new batch. The rotting wood from above has been replaced by burnt plastic, very present in the taste. Not really an improvement. At least the thinness seems to be remedied, making it even more slick.

Ringneck Imperial Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;The Brew Kettle;i relly enjoyed this beer, poured straw yellow with a one finger white head that faded quickly. good light taste, grainy. very refreshing with a good hop presence.
Ringneck Imperial Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;The Brew Kettle;22 oz. bottle purchased at the brewery. Deep golden pour with a medium white head that leaves some nice lace, and settles slowly to a thin white layer. Fresh aroma of some light grain, hay, and floral hops. Light to medium body, fine, light carbonation, and a pleasant mouthfeel. Sweet grainy flavor dominates, but some light bitter citrus dries it out a bit. Most cream ales are not very assertive, but this has a refreshing aroma and flavor with some substance. I also had it on tap at the brewery, and it was better than the bottled version, but it’s still pretty good in the bottle. Also, at 2:00/bottle at the brewery, it’s quite a bargain.
Ringneck Imperial Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;The Brew Kettle;Draught sample (on nitro) at the brewpub, early August 2006. A bit oily-looking solid gold with a lasting creamy super-smooth head....mild grainy nose offers whiffs of light floral honey and rather bland applesauce....sweet, lightly syrupy body enhanced (?) by bits of apple and lemon, faintly alcoholic growing to noticeably so, somewhat grainy thick maltiness throughout...well, all right.
Ringneck Imperial Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;The Brew Kettle;Sample at the brewpub: Dark golden color with a medium and foamy white head. Thick lacing throughout. The aroma is fruity and hoppy. Light-bodied with bitter hops flavor first and foremost, with a bit of fruit and malt behind it. The bitterness overshadows the other flavors to the overall deteriment of the beer though. The finish retains the bitterness along with a citrus aftertaste. Similar in some ways to Sirius in some respects, but not nearly as good.
Ringneck Imperial Cream Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Strong Ale - American;The Brew Kettle;22 oz bottle from the brewery 8/17/06: pours deep gold w/ a short lived white head. Light amounts of alcohol, deep green fruitiness up front. A little toasty, but mostly grainy malt. Aroma is a bit malt liquor like. Flavor is malty, a bit sweet, and lightly alcoholic. A bit of floral citrusy hop flavor and bitterness @ the finish & aftertaste. Mostly bitter in the aftertaste that lingers. Fuller medium body, lower carbonation, fairly smooth m/f. Alcohol warmth. More malt liquor like than cream ale like, not a favorite of mine.

Aromatic juicy raspberries on the nose. Starts of very promising with flavours of fresh raspberries, strawberries, jam, but ends abruptly with a water mid-palate and flat light malt finish. Low-medium complexity, low-medium depth, below average transitions, crappy carry, good drinkability. While drinkable and refreshing with an outdoor bbq’d meal, I can’t say it’s a good session beer.

As for the head, there it was, gone. Aroma was certainly of raspberry and so was the taste. In fact, only raspberry and bugger all to suggest that this might be beer; at least sweetness was not at issue here. Mouthfeel was ""average"", and the aftertaste was a slight improvement over the initial taste but that isn’t saying much. I just do not like the way this one tastes; too bad as I really like raspberries and beer, too."

Tahquamenon Falls Blueberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Draft. Gold pour. Smells and tastes like blueberry kool aid if that exists. Not amazing.
Tahquamenon Falls Blueberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Reviewed from notes and this was on tap at the brewpub. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a nice looking hazy amber to slight purple tinges around the edges of the beer. Since it was a bar pour, the head was fairly thin and there wasn’t much lacing. The smell definitely had the blueberry with a decent breadiness running underneath my nose. The taste was mainly sweet through the blueberry and somewhat biscuit - like to bread goodness all around. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation seemed pretty good as the wheat part seemed to take over as far as the back bite on the palate goes. Overall, I say this was a pretty good blueberry wheat ale worthy of having again.
Tahquamenon Falls Blueberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;bread, citrus, dough, golden, clear,medium sweetness, lightly bitter, lightly sour, medium body, long finish, lively. I cannot say enough about this beer. One would think when they hear it is blueberry flavor it has a strong fruity flavor. the blueberry flavor is so light you can just make it out. Not overpowering in anyway. Combined with the wheat it is a perfect blend of the 2. After having a pint at the brewpub I purchased a growler with a Styrofoam cooler and ice to keep it cold. It was kept cold for the rest of my vacation, in a Coleman cooler with ice in the Mackinaw City area of Michigan, all the way to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where I tried another very good Michigan beer, Founders Cerise. I purchased a growler of the Cerise as well. After Grand Rapids I took the growler’s of beer packed in a cooler full of ice all the way to the Laselle/Peru area of Illinois for a couple of days, then to Des Moines, Iowa for 2 days. Upon returning home to Sioux City, Iowa the unopened growlers were then opened and the beer enjoyed by myself and friends. It was as good as the day I first tried it at the brewpubs.

Actually for a fizzy little drink ,this stuff was OK. Or possibly it was the fact I had my kids in tow (at this nice establishment) and I NEEDED multiple drinks to soothe my jangling nerves? Either way I consumed several of them without hurling all over this establishment. So that’s something, I guess....or not. But one supposes, you could have the BEST BLUEBERRY BEER EVER, by cracking a Blatz and shoving some blueberries in your can/bottle/40 ouncer, and lighting out for Blueberry Nirvana.
Tahquamenon Falls Blueberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Poured gold with a slight blue tint. Aroma was full of blueberries and a bit of tartness. Flavor was a bit overwhelming blueberries and it wasn’t aided by the low carbonation in the beer.
Tahquamenon Falls Blueberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap...Gold lagerish looking beer with very little head. Blueberry flavor is OK, but the rest of the malt backbone has a fake Splenda-like fakeness. No balancing hops are detectable. While not as flat as their stout, this one was also undercarbed. Dissapointing.
Tahquamenon Falls Blueberry Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Aroma is a more authentic tart blueberry skin, with edges of vegetal and a core of jam sweetness. Blends well with the malt sugars. Spicy, as if with andouille sausage. Reminds me very much of Fitger’s Blitzen’s Blueberry Porter. It’s all downhill from here. Pour of heavily hazed peach, with gold fringes. Rim of extremely coarse bubbly white head. No carbonation. This beer is 100% flat. That’s horrible. The flavor is a weak soapy malt candy, with artificial blueberries creeping in from the corners. Again, a fake blueberry soap. Absolutely no carbonation. This beer is 100% flat, fresh from the tap. Palate, sans carbonation, is wickingly sweet. Shouldn’t beer be carbonated? At least the blueberry flavor was quasi-authentic.
Fukunotomo Junmai Ginjo Mataemongura Sake;Senboku-gun, Akita-ken, Japan;Saké - Genshu;Fukunotomo Shuzo;Slight straw color, nice legs. Licorice, melon, koji in the nose, quite a deep, rich scent. A thick feel, complex . This is the Barley Wine of sakes, layers of flavor, juicy, chewy. The koji and rice flavors are prominent, there is a sweet, fruity taste giving way to more nutty flavors in the middle and a strong but fairly smooth alcohol finish, hot yes, but not rough. Follow is warm and earthy. Somewhat reminds me of a good Belgian Quad. WOW, a small 200 ml bottle , wrapped in a local newspaper with a label affixed to it. What a diamond in the rough! I’m glad you enjoyed these B.D. & thanks for adding all my oddball stuff!
Fukunotomo Junmai Ginjo Mataemongura Sake;Senboku-gun, Akita-ken, Japan;Saké - Genshu;Fukunotomo Shuzo;180mL Bottle: Neat newspaper wrap with stickers, just like the picture, with a fairly boring, but discriptive label underneath. Pours a light beige color with some decent little legs. The nose is very fresh and fruity like strawberry and cotton candy, fresh koji and light alcohol. The flavor is a bit neutral at first, then the alcohol slaps your palate with quite a bit of force. After you’re accustomed to the alcohol level, you get a nice snappy minerally mouthfeel. Very masculine! The nose is light and fruity like a little school girl then you take a sip and you’re arm wrestling a drunken sailor. The finish is a bit medicinal and fairly acidic with a long drawn out burn. The nose grabs you, then you’re stuck for the ride. Interesting sake! Thanks Dan-san.
Illinois Maggies Irish Red;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Illinois Brewing;(Tap) Pours an amber color with a small white head. Sweet caramel in the aroma, along with some fruits. Fruity notes and some sugar in the taste as well. Light palate. I think this would make a better ’amber’ than their amber ale.
Illinois Maggies Irish Red;Bloomington, Illinois, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Illinois Brewing;Reddish amber with a white head. The aroma is malty with some apples and pears. Somewhat thin and flat, but I’ve had more than one of this style that’s the same. Tastes good, the fruity malts continuing into the flavor, complemented by a light, earthy bitterness. Apple finish. Okay. Illinois Brewing Company, Bloomington, IL
Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured an almost black color with a large creamy white head that left excellent lacing. The aroma was toffee, caramel and faint vague berries. The flavor was dark fruits, toffee, caramel and had a bit of a boozy presence. Medium length finish. Moderately full bodied. Enjoyable but I had hoped for better.
Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Pours cloudy amber with a thick and lacy head. Soft cherry, funk and tea nose. The taste is a bit flabby, and really doesn’t keep the promises that the aroma was making.
Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;750, corked and baled, with a cool label. Murky dark amber. Loose tan film. Mild bready, toffee, cherry nose. Mildly watery, thinnish body. A little bit of cherry on the mid-palate, not much finish. Surprisingly underpowered for the style and abv and all that.
Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Thanks for sharing, iowaherkeye. Hazy dark copper brown. Very murky with a light thin khaki head. The aroma has some caramel and blackberries. There is also a little bit of funkiness. The taste is sweet blackberries with some toffee and iced tea. There is also a strong candi sugar note in the long lightly toasted nutty finish.
Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Pours mahogany with no carbonation to speak of. Smells of caramel, buttery, tarte, some spiciness and fruity undertones. Tastes fruity with a lot of sweet malt presence and some alcohol burn on the finish. Not bad, but I found the other quadzillas I’ve had to be more rounded than this one.

Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Bottle, I’m guessing 2006 vintage: Pours a murky dark copper mahogany with a fairly-full, stringy-lacing off-white head. Aroma of sweet dark caramel, some oxidation and berries. Body starts with a good, dense dark caramel malty complexity with a lot of dark fruity and berry complexity along with a touch of cardboardy oxidation. Finishes smooth and semi-tart. An interesting brew, but could use a touch more sweetness and a little less oxidation.
Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;(750ml bottle, 2006 vintage, blackberry release) Pours a murky brown body with a spare beige head. Aroma of dark fruit (raisins, plum, dates, blackberry), caramel, and mustiness. Flavor of rich malts, cherry, dark fruits, and caramel.
Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Bottle brought home last July...shared with MRomero. The pour is a very cloudy burnt reddish brown. No real head to speak of. Fruity malt aroma...not that complex, but not bad either. Flavor follows suite....hints of dark fruits, berries...tastes better than it smells. Quite thin mouthfeel, wish it was fuller. A little alcohol kick in the end.
Church Brew Blackberry Quadzilla;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Church Brew Works;Thin dense head of fine bubbles. Minimal carbonation. Head lingers for a while. Sweet fruity and malty aroma with some caramel. Complex fruit aroma. Lots of dark fruits, blackberries, etc. Quite good actually. Color is a murky mahagony red. Sweet, malty, alcoholic. Dry and fruity palate with lots of vinuous notes. Nice alcohol warming. Finish is dry and fruity with a lingering raspberry tartness. Pretty damn good stuff. Thanks to pmarsh for sharing this one.
General Lafayette Dunkle Sam;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Copper Crow Beer Company;Thin dense head of beige bubbles. Light carbonation. Aroma is mosty malt with some dry roasted grains in the aroma. Dark ruby brown in color. Thin and extreamly soft palate. Probably from the wheat. More malts and a dry fruity bitterness. Very strange combination of flavor but still quite good. Noticable alcohol presence. Ready for this. Little bit of string beans in the flavor also. Finishes soft and clean. Different and decent.
General Lafayette Dunkle Sam;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draft at the brewpub, July 2006. A hazy orange-red beer with a rim of brown head. The aroma is of oranges and wheat. The flavor is wheaty combined with notes of caramel and strawberries, leading to a dry wheaty end where a note of berries lingers for a long time.
General Lafayette Dunkle Sam;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Copper Crow Beer Company;Deep, red-tinged copper body with a soft, velvety cream-colored head. Very nice clove, chocolate, and fried banana aromas. Phenols are clean and pleasant. Rich and malty flavor with a hint of dark fruit and some nice yeast signatures. Moderate-high sweetness, but plenty of balancing character. Ample, bready texture and body. Very good dunkleweizen, but it’s so flavorful that it’s almost cloying and not exactly quaffable. Great as an 8-ounce sipper though.
Picaroons Apricot;Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Picaroons Traditional Ales;very light in color with thin, white head. aroma has some fruit. very light mouthfeel with mild apricot flavour - not overly sweet (or sour for that matter). I presume this is basically the Dooryard recipe with apricot flavouring. could serve a valuable purpose on a really hot day.
Picaroons Apricot;Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Picaroons Traditional Ales;Looks like an excellent Pale Ale. Color and head are good. Bring the glass to you mouth and get a nose full of Apricot. Flavour is very strong apricot. There is a sweetness, but balanced well against the fruit tartness and the bittering. An excellent Fruit beer
John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Draft at TAP NY. Pours amber with an off white head. Citric and flowery hops, with sweet and grainy malts. A bit too prominent of a malt profile, but otherwise pretty good.
John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;In short: A rich creamy caramelized stout with citrusy peppery hops. Fun beer How: Tap at Tap-NY 2012 The look: Clear dark golden body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention In long: Nose is ripe citrusy hops with a spicy twist over caramel. Taste has a big creamy lively body with lots of caramelized malts, some fresh honey too. Rich maltiness that manages to avoid feeling heavy. In fact the malts are stealing the spotlight away from the citrusy hops. I also got a strong spicy-peppery sensation from the hops. A different take on the style (at least this batch was). I liked it. Anyway a few days after drinking this beer I watched Animal Planet, and get this, actual hippopotamus don’t really eat marbles.
John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On draught at the brewpub. Arrived a hazy amber with a thin-moderate off-white head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left partial lace. Surprisingly light aroma for a DIPA with mild grapefruit and a touch of caramel. The flavor is malt and caramel followed by some grapefruit, both fruit and pith. Moderate bitterness at the finish that lingers very briefly beyond the swallow. Below average for a DIPA.

John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;the aroma is cramel sweetness, and citrus - very nice. The appearance is a red/orange, white head. The flavor is caramel, soap, pine needles (where the hell is the soap from?) The finish is long, resiny bittering. Medium/thick in body. Quite good.
John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Dark, near-brown pour has a nice hoppy aroma of pine and tart spices. This is rather full-bodied and has a nice robust texture. Flavor is IPA standard with a good hop profile that fully masks any alcohol and has a strong malt body. This is a fairly sturdy, enjoyable IPA that is above the usual brewpub-chain fair. One of the better I’ve had from John Harvard’s.
John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap. Aroma of tropical fruits, berries, very hop-forward. Flavor juicy with lots of bitter berries, some alcohol. Very bitter finish and a touch of unpleasant alcohol. Still a nice one though.
John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at JH. Pours amber with a ring of white head. Aroma of citrus and grassy hops. Flavor of potpurri, sweet grapefruit, nice hop bitterness, with a sweetness in the finish. Nice IIPA but a little light on the flavor.
John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;20070428 Tap at TAPNY. Yet another nice, balanced, hop-forward double ipa from a New York brewer. Sweet and sticky, no noticeable alcohol, cookie notes in background. Nice enough to drink all day.
John Harvards HOPpopotamus;Lakegrove, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap. Light malt note of light bread, heavy hop aromas of pine and grapefruity/lemon, light yeast of earth and mustiness with wood and sulfur in the background. Head is frothy white, with good lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is a hazy red/brown. Flavor starts moderately sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and moderately bitter. Palate is medium, between watery and oily, and the carbonation is soft. It finishes lightly astringent and dry. A good drinker but not much balance, simple hop character, and not enough complexity throughout. This might have been a little old as this was served on tap, not in it’s usual on cask. Needs a re-rate.
Chiemseebräu Doppelbock;Grabenstätt, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Chiemseebräu;On tap at the brewpub. A almost clear deep amber beer with a huge good lasting beige head. Aroma of strong caramelish malt, red fruits. Taste of caramelish malt, red malt, red fruits, strong malt.

Elmars Terminator Bock;Henley Brook, Perth, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Elmars In The Valley;Sampled at the brewery on our recent return visit to Perth and the Swan Valley. One of two seasonals on offer. Clear brassy golden, average white cap. Grainy aroma with hints of apple fruit. Grainy flavour that is a touch toasty, the same hint of apple fruit, low bitterness.
Elmars Terminator Bock;Henley Brook, Perth, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Elmars In The Valley;Another poorly lasting head on a copper honey coloured body. Much better balanced than the former beer as I was expecting this to a bigger tasting beer. Mainly malt showing, touch grainy, burnt toffee on a light to medium body. Nothing outstanding but overall easily drinkable as the alcohol is there but not interfering.
Elmars Terminator Bock;Henley Brook, Perth, Australia;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Elmars In The Valley;When is hot alcohol a good thing? For some unknown to myself reason it aided this little rocket-fuelled monster. Only 6.4%, but f’firks ’ake it was heady. Poured a bright tawny copper with minimal carbonation and minimal head retention. Light laxed trace of white daubed the glass here and there. Toffeeish, warming, sticky date pudding nose dowsed with clear spirits. Strong kick of hot alcohol in the mouth with a levelled malt, wood, and toffee backbone. Bitter, burnt fruit, pecan pie and a ship load of cough medicine add to its extremities. Finish has again alcohol but it is more controlled, warming and harbouring some pleasant berry, nut and pale malt flavours, and is overall smooth to its credit. Body is treacly, not overly big and very light in carbonation. It hasn’t got the flavour to hold the alcohol, but again for some reason it works as a strong lager. Went well with my Schweinn Haxe, and the fact it was cold and windy outside. Good effort overall.

Almus Lager;Lom, Bulgaria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lomsko Pivo AD;8/27/18 - Pensacola, Fl - Four Winds International Food Store - 500 ml bottle - labeled as 'Lomska Veronica'. Pours a pale, sparkling golden with a frothy, white head with light lacing. Aroma is skunky, with some sweet cake mix like biscuity notes. The skunkiness mellows as it settles. Flavor has some sweet honey notes with some sweet biscuity back end accents. Mouthfeel is thick enough - sweetness fades just a bit near the end. Overall, much better though, than expected then when I first opened it.
Almus Lager;Lom, Bulgaria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lomsko Pivo AD;Bottle, 500 ml. Very nice surprise, somehow i tought it's gonna be a below average lager, but actually it's very decent. Good, deep golden, foam can be recalled by swirling the glass. Sour and sweet malt aeomas on the nose, a bit limey, but not unpleasent. Same taste, bit sour, but also sweet, some greenish notes, like white bread in green apple juice. Great carbo and a medium aftertaste. It can be a good choice, especially for 0.85€. R U kiddin' me?

Lively in the mouth, but little flavour is released, some maltiness, medium bitterness, but no hoppy flavours. Slight sweetness and a dry finish.

Caramel aroma with a lot of creamed corn. Flavor heavily into the sulfurous cooked vegetables, with just a bit of hops bitterness to offset this. Not usually what I’m looking for in a beer, but if I accept it on its own terms, there’s nothing off with it. Medium body and zest.

Fauerbach Export;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Fauerbach Brewing Company;Thanks to Bob for the bottle! Poured healthy medium golden with a well-retained cap of off-white head.. but it was chunkified. The aroma picked up soft bready and caramel notes with dry herbal notes, lemon zest, and sour grains surrounding. The flavor was more centered around the caramel with a bit of cardboard, sour malts, and slight vegetal on the back.. had a tacky, sweeter finish that wasn’t very enjoyable. Lighter-bodied with tackiness, sour notes, and high carbonation throwing off the flow on the palate.. drinkable, but not very good.

Bow Valley Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Meh... Fairly easy to tell why this stuff is so Cheap. Smells of stale grain, tastes like the bleached white rice that costs $2.00 a pound. You get what you pay for though
Bow Valley Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;light body, thin feel, lively, bread, grass, golden, clear, medium sweetness, Fairly standard and inoffensive beer. Served cold on a hot day it’s agreeable enough but nothing special. It stands up well against the likes of Molson Canadian or any of the other big brewers’ light beers, but it’s not a style I particularly like. One of Big Rock’s budget brews, marketed as Pine Creek.
Bow Valley Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Bow Valley. Reviewed straight from bright gold can, aesthetically pleasing. Poured some out to note clear, yellowy colour. Medium carbonation. Aroma is corn and grass. Taste is exactly the same, with a bubbly mouthfeel of plain, grainy beer. Certainly one of the better dollar beers, but nothing one should ever drink seriously.
Bow Valley Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;355ml can pours a pale golden color with a finger of white head that leaves no lacing. Aroma is cereal grains and grass. Taste is light malty sweetness with a horrid hop bitterness that lingers on the palate. A terrible brew that just sickens me whenever I taste it. It is one my father purchases on a regular basis.
Bow Valley Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;"Single can purchased from Paradise Liqour in Edmonton, AB on 07/22/2011. Colour: Pale yellow, no head. Nose: Smells like malt liqour, abundant gingerale, rotting egg. Taste: Medium sweet, medium-light bitter, light sour. Again gingerale but flat and stale. Quickly fades to bitter cardboard. Absolutely attrocious. Embarrased that Big Rock would make such crap - but now understand why they have the affiliate brewery name ""Pike Creek"" attached to the can..."
Bow Valley Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Generosity abounds on x-mas day! Though this might not quite deserve it... I’m going to give a few points here. This is really more like beer flavoured water that still has enough % to get the job done but there really isn’t much to go on, it is so damn thin. It’s not actually offensive though, and I’ll never forgive Banks Carribean lager for itself.
Bow Valley Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;This beer is the favorite of pathetic old alchies wiith jobs in my town. Pours piss yellow.Aroma is horrible. stinks like the smell of whiskey coming out of your pours after a morning of hard drinking. The flavour is very light and very cheap. almost like a slightly yeasty tasting glass of water. not offensive, this beer is drinkable but it’s just plain terrible.
Bow Valley Lager;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;Horrible beer. Absolutely no reason why I will ever consume this again. Pour is pale yellow and foamy white head. Tastes like someone peed in my mouth and mixed it with beer. Overall, pretty gross.

Mild to medium koji scent. A light buttery feel. Mild flavor, not much depth just a basic musty wood flavor. Momokawa makes much better stuff, I just don’t think they use a top shelf sake to make this gold flake style.
Pearl Street Kaiser Dunkel;Buffalo, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);On tap at the brewpub. Beer was just called Dunkelweizen, but this is the only dunkel listed on the site and I suppose I shouldn’t add a new one. Not as dark a pour as I was anticipating, a little light. Sweet and a little lighter than expected for the style.
Pearl Street Kaiser Dunkel;Buffalo, New York, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Pearl Street Grill & Brewery (NY);Perfectly clear medium-dark tan. Nose is caramel, earthy hops, a hint of bananna, orange. Flavor is rich dusty caramel malt, grass. Maybe a hint of bananna & clove in the finish. Nice body. The yeast & clove I would expect from a dunkelweiss just isn’t here.

Golden Avalanche Blueberry Lager;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Say what you want about pale lagers/ales and fruited pale lagers/ales, but this one was something special. The pour was pale gold, so nothing great there, but I loved the aroma, a mix of natural smelling blueberries straight off the bush, plus some hopcitrus and pale malt. I could smell this one all day. As expected, the palate was on the light side in heft, but I truly enjoyed the blueberry flavor, which had the natural blueberry sweet/tart dichotomy, and was balanced with a crisp finish and extremely smooth beer. This one is very good.

Gritty McDuffs Altitude Ale;Portland, Maine, United States;Pale Ale - English;Gritty McDuffs;On tap at the Auburn Pub. Pours a light amber with a foamy white head. Aroma is lemon zest, malt, and a little hint of goldings hops. Flavor is pretty similar, lemon bite on your tongue followed mid sip by a sweet gentle flavor with a slightly bitter end. Pretty nice drinking hot weather beer. Although it was a bit stinging on the palate and extremely watery feeling on the tongue. Not sure how long this one will be around, but I’ll bet it’s a pretty limited offering.
Fukumitsuya Kazeyo Mizuyo Hitoyo Junmai Ginjo Sake;Kanazawa-shi, Ishikawa-ken, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Fukumitsuya Shuzo;Another “Fume Blanc” looking sake, has that touch of straw color to it. Light melon and koji scent. A dry sake with vinous, oak and earthy flavors. A light grainy sweetness up front with a cashew flavor in the middle and a dry finish with a scant alcohol follow. My first sake from Ishikawa-ken. An interesting, different style than what I’m used to up here in the north.
Fukumitsuya Kazeyo Mizuyo Hitoyo Junmai Ginjo Sake;Kanazawa-shi, Ishikawa-ken, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Fukumitsuya Shuzo;300mL Bottle from IslandHaole: Nice frosted bottle with a cool peel off plastic top covering the screw cap. Pours a relatively beige color with nice legs. The nose is fairly typical of these junmai ginjos with some anise and melon. The flavor is a bit different with some strong koji, minerals and dusty alcohol. A bit strong in acidity and dryness, but the nose is good. Finishes a bit flat and tangy. It doesn’t quite has that nice freshness or umami that I like. A bit strong tasting too, especially for the low alcohol. Thanks Dan!
Gigi Super Brune;Gérouville, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Gigi de l'Etoile;[Bottled] Clear brownish dark amber. Some soap and saccharine. Too sweet with clean mouthfeel and notes of plums. Chemical bitter finish. Not my drink of choice, but better than their blonde...

Hook Norton Hooky Gold (Bottle);Hook Norton, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hook Norton Brewery;From Jun 2008 Purchased at Wilbur's Total Beverage. Nice medium gold in colour with a 2 finger head of foam and there's some good lacing. Head retention is very good! The nose has a nice hoppy(grass, touch of grapefruit) aroma with a bit of maltiness in the background, and after it warmed up some, I notice some fruity notes as well. The taste starts off nice with an earthy hop bitterness but then the malty sweetness comes into play and I find myself drinking a very nicely balanced Pale Ale. And...this tastes fresh! Dang. Medium mouthfeel here, the carbonation is light but right, and it finishes on the slightly malty side. Oh, and I find that it's very drinkable. I could easily put away a few of these at 1 sitting. I wish I had picked up more than 1 bottle of this but with UK beers, especially the ones that are light on the alcohol, you just never know what you're going to end up with. In my book, this is a winner.

Nose is orange zest, straw, grass, biscuit and stone fruit, maybe a peach. Refreshing, easy going, light ale with bags of flavour. Very citrusy, zesty, touch resinous, and a nice biscuit, straw, grassy finish. Good session ale if in the pub, at 4.1% abv I could neck a good few of these.
Clearwater Village Pride;Bideford, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Clearwater Brewery;Cask gravity at the Barnstaple Beer Festival, 19/08/2006. A very light hay aroma.

Fegley's Brew Works Monkey Wrench;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Fegley's Brew Works;In short: An amateurish yeasty Belgian blond ale. Bad. How: Bottle 750ml, consumed a few months after purchase. The look: Opens with a loud pop, then pours a cloudy dark blond body topped by a persistent small white head. In long: Nose is very estery, papayas and bananas, phenols, spices. A rather intense aroma that is not all that inviting. Taste is sweeter than expected, bananas covered with white sugar, coriander seeds, hospital gloves, strange vegetal flavors, a whole lot of yeast, lime juice, noes of wet cardboard, more.... An unpleasant after-taste. Fluffy yeasty body with a generous carbonation. Clearly Belgian in nature but I fail to see any Saison character here. This is a mess of disorganized flavors, an overall amateurish impression. For what it’s worth the wife didn’t think it was all that bad so I let her have half the bottle, I didn’t care for that beer one bit. Instead of music, suicide hotlines should have a waiting message suggesting to drink a Monkey Wrench, nobody wants that to be the last beer they drink.

Woodstone Creek Mead;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;750 ml bottle sample at the source. Clear yellow pour. Still.

Woodstone Creek Mead;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;Pour from a 750 ml bottle at Woodstone Creek during a tasting. The straight-up mead pours a white wine color, slightly darker than the Taliesin, with no head or visible carbonation. It drinks like a white wine, too, sharing the same texture with minimal honey sweetness and good wildflower botanicals. Light-medium bodied, with no carbonation and a dry, smooth mouthfeel. Good mead.

Woodstone Creek Mead;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;Sampled from 750 mL bottle at the Woodstone Creek Winery and Distillery tasting room... Woodstone Creek Mead is a still mead. It is a yellowish copper color and clear. It is made with Kentucky Goldenrod honey which is evident in the modestly sweet honey aroma. The flavor showcases the honey, but it isn’t overly sweet or just honey-like in flavor as there is a dry white wine like taste as well. It finishes a little dry. Overall this is a semi-sweet mead that has a nice level of dryness and isn’t too heavy on the palate (the body is medium light). A very well done mead.

Woodstone Creek Taliesin;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead - Metheglin/Spiced/Herbs;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;"Sampled from 750 mL bottle at the Woodstone Creek Winery and Distillery tasting room... Woodstone Creek Taliesin is a very interesting and complex mead made in the ""Elizabethan-style"". I thought that the term ""Elizabethan"" is usually attributed to Pyment (grapes added), but according to the description of this mead, this is a Metheglin (spice/herbal) and there is no grapes added. Either way, something is definitely added to the honey must (must : mead :: wort : beer) to give it a wonderful cornucopia of flavors! This is a still mead and its color is a clear light yellow. The aroma was a delicate mix of lemon, ginger, and honey. This mixture of ingredients is carried through into the flavor along with some spice and toasted vanilla from the barrel aging. It has a light body. This is definitely an interesting, complex, and memorable mead."

Pours a barely cloudy white wine color with no head or carbonation; just a wee bit prettier than the base Mead or the Taliesin. It’s also got more sweetness than those, as well. Good balance of ginger and honey here, without the subtle citrus notes of the Taliesin. Light-medium bodied, with no carbonation and a smooth, sweet mouthfeel. I’d give the edge to this one between the two, but barely."
Woodstone Creek Ginger Honey;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;"750 ml bottle to wine glass at Woodstone Creek. Looks good; a still and transparent honey gold. Smells solid; honey and ginger. Tastes like it smells with a solid mouthfeel. Enjoyable."
Woodstone Creek Ginger Honey;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;Sampled from 750 mL bottle at the Woodstone Creek Winery and Distillery tasting room... At first the ginger in the Woodstone Creek Ginger Honey reminded me of the Woodstone Creek Taliesin. However, after a couple more sips it was quite clear that these were two very different meads. This mead is considerably sweeter. In addition the flavors are ginger and sweeter honey, nbut o lemon, citrus, or toasted oak complexties as found in the Taliesin. This mead had a dry finish. The alcohol content was well hidden as well. In general this is also a still mead and has is pale yellow in color.
Woodstone Creek Ginger Honey;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;Sample at tasting room. Poured clear pale color with good legs. Heavy ginger honey aroma. Light to medium body with a sticky texture. Medium honey ginger sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable mead.

Woodstone Creek Honey Mist;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;"Sampled from 750 mL bottle at the Woodstone Creek Winery and Distillery tasting room... Woodstone Creek Honey Mist is definitely a Pyment. The fruity grapiness of the white wine that is blended in is easily distinguishable. the honey takes a half step or so behind the fruity grape in the bouquet and flavor. Don’t get me wrong, the honey isn’t completely masked; the blend is actually very well done as it is nicely balanced (just enough to slightly showcase or bring out the qualities of the grapes). This is a still mead that has a clear, golden color. After drinking the first couple meads, this one is much sweeter, but probably only moderately sweet on the over all scale. This was another memorable mead and propably the best Pyment I have had to date..."

Woodstone Creek Traditional Honeywine;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;Mead;Woodstone Creek Winery & Distillery;Sampled from 750 mL bottle at the Woodstone Creek Winery and Distillery tasting room... Woodstone Creek Traditional Honeywine is made with Midwestern Wildflower Honey. As a result the aroma and flavor both have a nice floral quality to them. This mead is quite sweet and has a full, honey flavor. Even the actual honeycomb flavor seems to be captured in this still, yellow-colored mead! It has a medium body and is quite smooth on the palate.

Liquid Bread Harvest Rye;Hays, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lb. (Liquid Bread) Brewing Co;First off, why is it 96F in the middle of September? Secondly, BIG BIG props to LB for being an oasis in the middle of the hell that is I-70 through Kansas. Onto the beer, just about crystal clear, nice tight white foam, decent lacing. Aroma is fairly light, little bit of cascade hop in there somewhere. Flavor is just pure absolute refreshment, light, but not too light, just about perfect when you’re driving cross country in a convertible and it’s f’n hot.
Liquid Bread Harvest Rye;Hays, Kansas, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lb. (Liquid Bread) Brewing Co;Pours a very pale straw with a white head. The aroma is virtually nil. The flavor is also virtually nil. There is some graininess to the flavor (which I must imagine is the rye). The malts and hops flavors are very subtle. This simply needs to be bolder and more flavorful...
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;Very refreshing pumpkin beer! Very nice pumpkin flavor. Well put together. Alcohol level is well blended in the body of the beer. Well done!
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;Sampled on tap, orange color with a medium foamy head. Notes are pumpkin guts, spices, vegetal, cinnamon, and clove especially as it warms up. Lighter to medium body with similar carbonation. Alright, nose was much better than flavor.
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;Bottle from Total Wine in Palo Alto, CA. Aroma is sweet potato pie, fall spices. Taste is balanced malty pumpkin pie. Really lives up to the hype. Phyllis Schlafly eat your heart out!
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;Bomber. Pours a dark orange with a dissipating head and aroma of pumpkin pie spices. Taste is full of fall spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspices notes into the sweet finish.
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;Pours a very dark bronze color with a tiny beige head and poor retention. No lacing. Strong spiced aroma. Similar flavor. Spice-dominated flavor with very little actual pumpkin flavor. A nice change-up from regular beer, but too heavily spiced for regular consumption. Noticeable boozy warmth in the finish.
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;At home, bomber with the boys. Pours a dark pumpkin color with no head. Pour a dark pumpkin rusted color. Nose is deep spicy sweet pumpkin with autumn spices. Taste is sweet sugary pumpkin with a myriad of ‘ autumn spices’. Finishes on the sweet pumpkin notes... a nice sipper.. Quaff Score 8 / 10
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;A pumpkin beer. Not a sickeningly sweet pumpkin beer, not a wickedly over-spiced pumpkin beer, but a pumpkin beer just the same, with all the baggage that comes with it. One day I'll learn and just give up on the style, but, dammit, Paste said this bottle was good. I disagree.
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;A malt-head's delight from a long-time St. Louis crafter whose product, I regret, I drink too little of. Schlafly captures the season well. It looks like a dark red maple leaf right before it is so dry it falls off the tree. It smells of the season's spices and, separating itself from the growing pack of pumpkins, Schlafly's does not have an artificial taste. Just sits rich in the mouth like a balanced dessert.
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;Draught @ Pilsener Haus. Reddish amber with foamy beige head, light pumpkin aroma, medium carbonation, medium bitter roasted pumpkin taste, smooth body, long pumpkin finish. Very good pumpkin beer.
Schlafly Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Pumpkin / Vegetables;Saint Louis Brewery;Truly one of the finest pumpkin ales out there, deceptively big at 8% abv. Perfectly balanced spice that doesn’t dissolve the pumpkin flavors. Look forward to it being tapped here every year!
Stone Coast High Rollers Wheat;Bethel, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;"Reviewed from old notes. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was slightly hazy/cloudy a golden yellow color with a substantial two and a half fingered white foamy glossed over level sort of head - ""nice"" is just a decent word to use. Good, hell yeah, definitely good on this one. The smell had a super nice half hefe-esque, grainy to wheaty to a fairly nice sweet gritty, earthiness just running all around under my nose. The taste took those smells to the flavor and just combined fairly nicely. On the palate, this one sat at/about a light to medium on the body with a decent semi-sweet to wanted-to-be spicy glossy on the palate. Overall, I can’t necessarily endorse this beer, but will say it’s okay and leave it at that."
Stone Coast High Rollers Wheat;Bethel, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;Brewed in Portland, Maine, but tapped at Sunday River Brewing in Bethel, Maine--Golden hazy body with small wispy head. Not a very substantial proffering. Grainy, slightly hefe-esque. Gritty, earthy, watery. Mediocre at best.
Stone Coast High Rollers Wheat;Bethel, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;"6 ounce draught sample at the Vermont Brewer’s Fest (July 2007). Hazy light gold with a huge lasting frothy head and thick lacing; don’t often get a hefe at a festival that looks this good....very sour and wheaty aroma, like wheat bran in buttermilk, banana-clove impressions are muted....creamy body, fairly sharp and dry, has a somewhat Belgian yeast profile though I doubt that’s anything more than coincidental, lightly mineralic, dry and bitter at the finish, estery qualities muted.....somewhat thin on the finish. Overall, OK."
Stone Coast High Rollers Wheat;Bethel, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;On tap at the Great Lost Bear. Pours a light golden murky yellow with a little fizzy white head. Aroma is mostly biscuity but there’s some hints of citrus and fruits. Flavors are pretty simple, citrus, grass, hops, wheat, and yeast. Overall pretty bland and boring.
Stone Coast High Rollers Wheat;Bethel, Maine, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Sunday River Brewpub and Restaurant;"Draught pint at the Great Lost Bear, 8/18/06. Thoroughly cloudy, pale-gold/straw body sports a briefly-lived white head, which fizzles to a ring, leaving little/no lacing. Some muted banana in the nose is hinted at, but then blown away by bitter hops? I guess that’s what it is. Dry, with a leafy, herbal pungency and yielding, only minimally, to light cloves, creamed wheat and strong doughiness (white dough, some honey). Some citrus peel notes combine with the bitter hops and the banana is lasting, though never much more than an afterthought in the nose. Strength is rather weak, dulled by the heavy yeast clouding the liquid. Straw, dough, heavy wheat smoothness and nips of hop bittering, almost cascade-like press in to the palate upon first sip. The banana is minimal and fades in to a watery/wheat body that is only bolstered by some carbonation, initially, becoming too wet after warming/breathing. Some honey and lemon-flavored angel food cake-like notes battle with the heavy wheat, while the palate is somewhat bitten by the bitterness, on end. It’s certainly a unique take, and the hops don’t fatigue the palate, there just don’t seem to be enough other malt flavors going on. VERY clean; guess they just used their house yeast? That or they fermented this at a very low temperature for the style. Quenching, no alcohol apparent. Touches of breadiness and hay/straw-like graininess are the extent of the malt contributions after the palate adjusts. Pretty high ratio of water-to-malt, it seems to me. But the hop bitterness helps to clear the palate and does add some livliness. Dosen’t impart much flavor, though (nettles, lemons, grass)."
Haacht Bavaro;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haacht;[Bottled] Pale golden. Metallic and bland with traces of maize. Too light bodied with just a touch of late grassiness. Poor, also by low alcohol lager standards as far as I’m concerned.

Elzacher Löwenbräu Löwen Pils;Elzach, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Löwenbrauerei Elzach;"50cl local Getränkemarkt, as this is considered a regional speciality but not regional enough for bigger supermarkets to carry it. - Pours a greenish grainy lager with dull head. Label mentions use of feiner Tettnanger und Hallertauer Naturhopfen, but the doses are minimal; fine and persistent Tettnang spice and pepper remain mere hint. Metallic notes in aroma and defining mouthfeel. Bavarian-style sweet lager graininess. needs more than work to become a decent pils, e.g. different recipe. Rerate: 2nd bottle drunk in full sun with a view, shining a redeeming light on this modest but, granted, refreshing and lager-style SW-DE pils. Not likely to become a house beer, though. 2nd rerate: 2.5-2.8 33cl bottle 07/2013: distinctive lingering spicy/grassy hop presence that balances out the malt astringency at slightly higher temps. Starting to appreciate this more, tastes charmingly artisanal, if still not spectacular. // rerate 50cl bottle, bb08/2015: fresh this becomes muchx crisper, tastier, Tettnang-forward, dry: hop dosage does seem to waver, but this is among the better small-batch BW Pilsners out there +0.5 // Rerates 2015, cases of this stuff: yes this has become my house Pils, and rightly so: fresh and zippy with all that is good, dry, citrusfruity and local. Superb stuff, as only so far colleague pivnizub seems to have noticed."

Donagger Premium;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;"0,33 l can. Yet another Van Pur 4,0 ABV beer. Second in one day. I seem to have suicidal tendencies... Pours clear yellow with quickly dissipating frothy white head and huge air bubbles. Aroma is cardboard, more cardboard and some extra cardboard. Grainy with hints of malt. Taste is light sweet, light to medium bitter and slightly sour. Body is light, texture watery and carbonation above average. Finish is quite long, unpleasant sour bitterness. Really terrible. Note: same ""beer"" as all other Van Pur 4% ABV beers, same cardboard aromas, so I just copied on of my rates."

Stone (Argentina) Stout;Pilar, Argentina;Stout - Dry;Stone Brewing (Argentina);VEry nice beer, the problem is that the grains gave it a very bitter tatse and more like coffee sediments more than the tatse I like about malts. Anyway the foam is creamy and good in general.

Balanced and rich, multidimentional. It really fills my expectations for cask conditioned beer.
Neustadt Springs Manchester Bitter;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Neustadt Springs Brewery;on tap at C’est What beer fest. Corny aroma, sweet maltiness in the flavour, not exactly what i was expecting, but i appreciate the effort.
Neustadt Springs Manchester Bitter;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Neustadt Springs Brewery;Draught @ The Brewery: Along with pootz I to was filled in on the story of Manchester Bitter, and thusly feel permitted in providing the score it likely deserves. While I would never rate it lower than a Steelback beer, I will rate it lower than any other Neustadt product. Smells of wet, sweet grass. Pours deep yellow, no head. Flavour is slightly sweet, not at all bitter (at least not when cold), and fairly ordinary. Too bad I have a feeling it’s not seeing the light of day again.. haha

Neustadt Springs Manchester Bitter;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Neustadt Springs Brewery;Draught sample at Golden Tap Awards. Light, bright gold with a creamy head. Aroma of candy and popcorn - lots and lots of popcorn. Flavour of a mild malty ale with popcorn floating in it. Where the hell did all this popcorn come from? Based on the name, I guess they’re going for a Boddingtons style bitter - they got the appearance right, but that’s about it.

Pours a clear gold with a small diminishing white head. Aroma: hmmm, I’m not crazy about that. Smells like grain and canned peas with lots of corn and faint hops. Flavour’s no better, it tastes like it smells with a somewhat bitter finish and a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. Medium bodied. I can’t say I’m a fan of this and I’m not sure how it’s a ’Bitter’, in the end I couldn’t finish it. I won’t be getting it again.
Neustadt Springs Manchester Bitter;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Neustadt Springs Brewery;Draught. At BeerBistro, 2006 Golden Tap Awards. Clear, brassy gold with a small white head. I was looking forward to another attempt at a bitter, but the aroma? sweet - like corn syrup, if I’m being charitable maybe faint stale herbal hop in there, but as it warmed it reminded me of a swimming pool liner baking in the sun: corn & pvc, yum. The taste, however, was a somewhat pleasant surprise - it really was bitter! - dry (and stale), somewhat herbal hop bitterness, not really sweet at all, but unfortunately a somewhat harsh finish, and way too much corny grain. Average body, very lively mouthfeel, slightly unpleasant aftertaste - I didn’t hate it anywhere near as much as everyone else, but still not a very good beer.

New England Play Beer;Woodbridge, Connecticut, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;New England Brewing Co.;On draught at Delaneys. Pours coppery with a small white head. Smells malty with some underlying hoppiness. Tastes od toasted malt and on the doughy side.
Broad Ripple ReplicAle Farmhouse Ale;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;On Tap @ the Brewpub. Pours a slightly darkened orange with little head. Smells a little of fruit, wood, and a small amount of sweetness. Medium bodied with a tart sweetness that gives way to a more natural, dry woody aftertaste. I chose this while my buddy had the ESB (which was also nice) but I’m glad I went with this instead as I have a fondness for Saisons. Pretty damn good.
Broad Ripple ReplicAle Farmhouse Ale;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;Draft at Broad Ripple. Nice orange color that carries through a bit in the flavor. Slightly tart and dry start gives way to a chewy, syrupy and woody taste. Not much head to speak of. Finished nice and peppery. After going through all of their samplers, this was the beer I had for a full pint before closing.
Sarah's Cider - Dry [Rum Barrel] (Draught);Ledbury, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Sarah's Cider;A Mes rate. Gravity at the Southampton. Very slightly hazy orange gold colour. Tarty dry apple aroma with some fairly clear barrel and a strange but very enjoyable note of vanilla soaked ice cream wafer cone. You know when all the ice cream is gone and your left with a slightly soggy cone? That’s it. The flavour is the same. Very pithy and fleshy. Lots of wood and a really bright fresh squeezed apple juice finish. Verging towards medium rather than dry. Finishes with some chewy apple skin. Jolly tasty.
Sarah's Cider - Dry [Rum Barrel] (Draught);Ledbury, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Sarah's Cider;"Cask (gravity) Worcester BF. Not the driest and rummiest cider but has a certain elan; a smoothness and softness that belies its strength, somewhat coarser than the medium with just a little jammy raisin flavour to see it through."
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;Cask (handpump) at the Museum Tavern, Bloomsbury. More golden amber than pure blonde. Restrained aroma with hints of citrus. Didn’t get any signature Marstons sulphur, which would have been unwelcome in a golden ale. Moderately hoppy flavour, again with citrus to the fore. Perhaps the cascades do make a faint impression but the citrus is more lemon than grapefruit. Crisp & clean and served in good condition (albeit through a sparkler). Tart bitterenss lingers in the aftertaste. Straightforward but surprisingly decent - no doubt sets out to be refreshing and achieves that.
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;Golden colour with a fair amount of head. Didn’t have that rather nasty sulpherous smell that some of the other Marstons beers have. Quite a nice, floral aroma and a fresh taste, a little lower on hops than the avarage blonde beer, which was a nice change, a good malt, fruity sweetness balanced it quite well.
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;State bar. Apparently has just been put on, and tasted noteably fresh. However looked more muddy and mirky than the end of a cask of addelstons. A bit cold so near no aroma. Taste is well balanced honey and fresh grassy hop with hints of lime. Nice beer but soo increadibly mirky.
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;Cask handpull at County Hotel, JDW, Ashford. Jumping on the US hop blonde beer bandwagon. Gold colour, thick cream head. Slight burton snatch aroma. Citrus hops too. Pretty good condition in the mouth. Then US hop finish, so not surprised it says it has Cascades. It’s fine and perfect for summer.
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;A Sim rate (Cask at the Gatehouse): It’s ok but my general indifferance towards English hoppy blondes explains the mediocre rate. Aroma and flavour are very hoppy. Flavour is even too much hops. Palate is runny. Not a great beer.
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;Cask at Bankers Draft (JDW). Bedford. Served at just about the right temperature. Gold with a small white head. Grassy hop aroma with a definite whiff of sulphur. Citrus taste with a grainy background. Some bitterness. Pretty ordinary golden.
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;Good blonde too. Very yeasty flavour like other MAsrton’s, interesting taste.
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;<!-- b -->Aug<!-- /b --> Cask conditinoed @ Hymble Plumb, Soton. Sulphurous yeast and light body. The yeast doesnt complement the fresher citrus flavours of a golden ale, but then again the malts a bit heavy handed for my taste as well.
Marston's Pure Blonde;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Marston's;Cask handpump at the Swan in the Rushes, Loughborough. Clear golden with a slim white head. Sulphur aroma, (a bit like Pedigree use to have before they staring mucking about with it some years back, ruining a great beer), Citrus, malty and bitter taste. Not very well put together however, one was enough.

Abbey Wright Coeur de la Saison;Duboistown, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Abbey Wright Brewing Company;Aroma: some spices and some metal Appearance: pale yellow, some head, no lacing Flavor: weak, slightly spicy with some metallic-ness, some yeast and some grains, candied fruits, and slightly soapy Palate: watery, bubbly, slightly spiced-metallic aftertaste, soapy feel
Abbey Wright Coeur de la Saison;Duboistown, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Abbey Wright Brewing Company;Draught at the brewery. Soft red and orange color. Flavor is mild fruit, mild cream, some soapy notes as well, with anise and some other spices. Has some fruity yeast scents and flavors, but this is not your traditional saison, in fact it’s pretty weak. Has some bad funk to it all around. Mold in the nose doesn’t help.
Abbey Wright Highlander Scottish Ale;Duboistown, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Abbey Wright Brewing Company;On tap at the Pints for Pets brewfest. Dark near black color. Super dark and smoky aroma and flavor, with smoked malts being the focus. Pretty hot in the chest. A tad thin body.
Abbey Wright Highlander Scottish Ale;Duboistown, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Abbey Wright Brewing Company;Dark brown with lace. Sour taste out of sweetness, sour rather than much smokiness. Almost as if a sour pickel was thrown in the mash. Light mouthfeel. Like a dunkel beer.
Abbey Wright Highlander Scottish Ale;Duboistown, Pennsylvania, United States;Scottish Ale;Abbey Wright Brewing Company;ABC 06. Pours a moslty clear deep amber with a thin off white head. Poured a bit cold, but as it warmed, a nice nutty caramel malt aroma came through- slgihtly estery with some dirty yeast in there. Flavor is more caramel and toasted malts, very light chocolate nuttiness. Not sure on the alcohol, but it seemd a bit weak. Not bad though.
Abbey Wright Patience Pilsner;Duboistown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Abbey Wright Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Light fresh hoppy aroma. Mild grassy bitterness with the normal ’beaniness’ in the style. Light golden clear with no head. Medium-light watery body with medium-heavy carbonation. Starts with light sweetness followed by good grainy, grassy notes and flavorful floral hops. Great crisp bitterness throughout with mild gassy burn on the tongue. After is clean with mild bittering.

Liberal Cup We All (S)Cream Ale;Hallowell, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Liberal Cup Public House and Brewery;My first cream ale and i’ve got to say right off it was a bit bland. Poured with a dense head, slightly full body. Flavors were pretty simple, I tasted some light malt and a little sweetness, not much else. I’ve got to agree with Clark on the Boddington’s similarities.
Liberal Cup We All (S)Cream Ale;Hallowell, Maine, United States;Cream Ale;Liberal Cup Public House and Brewery;Get it? Scream. Yep.... Nitro pint at the brewpub on 8/18.06. One finger of dense, nitro-induced head is well-retained atop a cloudy, tallow colored body. Not much lace, if any. Soggy, wet pils-like malt, though it’s hard to really tell if it’s pils or American two-row. It’s light, it’s got honey note to it, little, if any graininess. Minty, leafy, peppery hops seem an afterthought, but more likely, is just lost amidst the gassy nitrogen bubbles. Kind of like boddingtons, or something. Soggy, cardboardy, soily hops, hardly any bitterness. The flavor dosent seem overly watery, for a nitro ale, especially a cream ale. So I will give it that. But there’s little here other than some honey and light pale sugar notes. Hops are too bogged down by the nitrogen and creamy-wet texture. Just gets filling, without much actual flavor. Ya....so, that’s about all I can stretch out of that beer. Who the hell puts a cream ale on nitro anyways?
Fox Plum Gold;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottle.Gold with a nice head,aroma of fruit and grass,taste is malty with dark fruit,i hope herman won’t miss his plums.
Fox Plum Gold;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Cask handpull at Kingston Arms, Cambridge. Gold with lasting white head. Strange to have this after the Bartram Dark Side. Bit of vinegar/citrus/cider, which means it could be getting tired. Not a huge aroma, and then a cidery appley flavour more than plum. Unless of course they are very sour plums you are using. Very sour under-ripe greengages is my guess. Soft in mouth. Finish is pretty drying with more sour plum. Funny, I expected it to be a rich plum beer, but it is far more sour than that.
Fox Plum Gold;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);A golden orange coloured beer with a thickish white head. A light hoppy aroma, with a hint of malty fruit. The taste is dry and hoppy, with a malty undertone, the fruit only comes through in the aftertaste, leaving a smooth, mellow mouthfeel. (Cask - @ The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Fox Samphire Stout;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);27/4/2019. Bottle from the Real Ale Shop, Wells. Pours very dark brown with a large off-white head. Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, liquorice, toffee, molasses, fruit cake and a herbal edge. Medium sweetness, moderate bitterness. Moderate body, slight oily texture, above average carbonation. Very nice aroma but went downhill a bit from there.
Fox Samphire Stout;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);[500ml bottle from Samphire, Blickling Hall, Norfolk] Pours brown - completely lifeless with no head. Gorgeous chocolate aroma. Salty overcooked cabbage in the flavour - presumably from the samphire. Some tar and cough mixture, but the chocolate just about wins through. Unusual, and could be good, but agree with previous comments about poor condition.
Fox Samphire Stout;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottle. Poured a pretty lifeless black, struggled to get even a semblance of a head - cokey and quickly disappearing. Aromas of red wine up front with salty, savoury, smokey notes and some roasted malt. Quite tart on the tongue, sharp berry notes with a light roasted, salty bitter finish. Appearance reflects the palate - lacking any real condition, mostly flat and light to medium in body. Looks like I need to try this from cask.
Fox Samphire Stout;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);BC?? Black squash pour slopping mutely into the pot. Fox have really impressed me with their bottled efforts in the past but this is dead and headless like morning after takeout. Nosing reveals damp end of festival vegetal notes, roasted nuttiness, Marmite on toast,coal, coffee, bramble. Not very subtle. Oily, faintly charred and a dab salty. Sourish with black cherry and bramble notes merging into brine, mocha, watery Marmite and cigar smokiness. Some decent stouty notes if you go digging. The interplay of sour, salty, bitter and....rockpool is interesting, but ultimately another English beer wrecked by bottle conditioning, or the lack of it.
Fox Samphire Stout;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottle.Black with a small head,aroma of coffee and red wine,taste is of red wine roasted coffee malt with some tartness,long dry black and raspberry finish.
Fox Samphire Stout;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Cask conditioned at The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk. Very dark brown beer, no head. Dark, deep roasted tarry notes abound from the start of the beer, hints of liquorice and, interestingly cloves, maybe this was from the seaweed and a heavy syrupy herbal flavour. Certainly an interesting beer if challenging.
Fox Samphire Stout;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);A dark, almost black, brown coloured beer with flashes of ruby red, topped with a thick off white head. A deep,roasted malt nose of coffee, liquorice and burnt sugar. The taste is bitter, with the tannic mouthfeel of an espresso! Coffee flavours are accompanied by roasted malt, caramel and liquorice, but there is an underlying green, vegetable saltiness, that comes from the samphire. (Cask - @ The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).

Ironbark Golden Wheat;Caversham, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ironbark Brewery;Sampled at the brewery. Murky yellow gold, this dense white cap. Nice spicy banana aroma. Banana and spices dominate the palate. Not very estery, with a lemony tartness in the finish. Refreshing.
Ironbark Golden Wheat;Caversham, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ironbark Brewery;Bright medium gold body with a decent size white head. Banana and cloves in the taste also some orange towards the finish, this was more fuller in body than the federation wheat and more enjoyable. Tried this back in July last year (06) but just noticed it in my notebook.
Ironbark Golden Wheat;Caversham, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Ironbark Brewery;Re-rate:- On draught at the brewery. Hazy, dusty gold with a tight off-white pad that held and laced with comfort. Banana, pears, ripe lemons, cloves, slight strawberry bubblegum in there - the aroma is now one considerably close to the finest of Southern Bavaria. In the mouth the ester/phenol mix keeps on rocking. The fruits stand out ripe and pronounced with a good-base of sour-dough, wheat malts and fresh, unkilned grain. Clove-like phenols are distant but still lie true in the swallow which is fruity, grainy and quite full with good, clean, ungammy length. The body is light enough to suit most of the patrons here as this is one beer that continues to sell out. Remains good even as it warms, especially with the warmth beginning this years Summer. A rather nice drop now, knew I needed to try it again!!! 8,4,7,3,16 August 22nd - An afternoon in the beer garden of this very friendly local and loyal haunt couldn’t go without atleast one new tasting. Sat on the Iron Bock for hours (due for a re-rate it is in prime-form right now) whilst listening to the live band and thought a change was as good as a holiday. From it’s own-label bottle, unusual amongst the beers here, into a schooner. ’Looks like a typical Aussie lager’ was the first impression. Bright medium gold, highly charged with very fine bubbles that desperately kept the soapy white head alive to leave behind minor lacing. Subtle, zesty, prickly lemon and grapefruit nose with a touch of candyish bubblegum and watermelon. Clean and lively. Doughy, smooth, a little soapy and light in carbonation inside the mouth. Initial bready yeast and overly dominant crystal malts settle in for the length. Lighter touches of lemons and sourish wheat malt, soft grapefruit and cantaloupe play a good part in keeping it tasty, though the crystal has a firm hold over the flavour. Finish is sweet, tangy and fruity despite its malty palate. It’s not a bad drop overall. Has that level of fruit flavours and malt sweetness that make it refreshing yet it could get a little heavy after a few. One to try again on draught for a re-rate. (33cL) 6,3,6,3,12
West Berkshire Barley Mow;Yattendon, Berkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;West Berkshire Brewery;Cask at Charlies. Clear amber coloured with an off white head. Aroma of malts and fruits. Flavour of malts, fruits and hops. Dry hoppy finish.
West Berkshire Barley Mow;Yattendon, Berkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;West Berkshire Brewery;DO NOT DELETE THIS BEER. A hazy amber beer with a light brown head. The aroma is sweet malty with primary notes of caramel, but also a bit of hops. The flavor is sweet with caramel dominating in the middle, which in the end gives way for notes of grass and a nice bitter end.
John Harvards Double DLicious Milk Stout;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Sample at the Pittsburgh location. This brew is a flat black color with a compact tan head and decent lacing. Chocolate and coffee dominate the aroma. Smooth and creamy body with flavors of cocoa and coffee, as well as a hint of malt. The finish is on the bitter side with coffee and hops, and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. I enjoyed this one.

Pours a cloudy orange from tap into a pint glass. Thin white head laces delicately. Nose is of wheat, hay, oranges, and a touch of floral hops. A nicely balance easy drinking beer.

Big Horn Wheeling Wit;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);On tap at Ram - Wheeling. Poured a hazy pale golden with a short cap of white head. Aroma was of faint sweet bananas and orange peel.. non-offensive, but too restrained. Sweet toasted bananas and star fruit in the flavor with mildly tart wheaty notes extending outward.. vegetal notes and orange peel at the back and through the finish.. some peppery spices too. Ugly feel on the palate.. tacky hints from sweetness and sourness don’t mesh together.

Poured cloudy yellow with small white head. Soft carbonation. Smokey clove aroma. Light-to-medium bodied wheat beer that starts dry with light malt sweetness and spicy clove/smoke/fruity flavors.

Grudziadz Gotyckie Krzepkie 9%;Grudziadz, Poland;Bock - Doppelbock;Browary Grudziadz;07/08 Directly from a 0.5 l bottle on a gas station around Katowice. What a name! It had some reddish body. Aroma of some roasted malt some coffee and a bit of alcohol. Flavor is being balanced between bitterish coffee and sweetish caramel. Alcohol is tried to be hidden but it’s felt, well, this is a lager not a Belgian ale so it’s acceptable. Medium body with very low carbonation. Finish was quite long, sweetish and a bit alcoholic, but somehow watery leaving that impression on the whole beer. Not bad at all, but I didn’t like it so much as well.
Grudziadz Gotyckie Krzepkie 9%;Grudziadz, Poland;Bock - Doppelbock;Browary Grudziadz;No 299 Rated: 09.01.2008 Bottle brown, 500 ml Appearance: Body is very clear, carbonation of body is weak, colour of body is rubby, dark like strong tea, with burned caramel. Head is like in fizzy drink and quickly disappearing to nothing after not a whole minute. I would give it 3 but totally no head gives me the posibility of 2 and no more. Aroma: Burned sugar, light alcoholic notes, toasty malt, Munich malt, some notes of cherries and apple being a bit rotten, coffee notes, a bit too sweet. Flavour: Alcohol is much better hidden than in ’Grudziadzkie Dobra Dziewiatka’, heaving also 9% abv. Beer is very soft in terms of carbonation, almost flat, slightly alcoholic, becoming medium alcoholic at the end, some notes of roasted or more toasted malts, some hints of mild coffee and grains, one of simple and poorer dunkler bocks, but not that bad espetially because of greatly builded in alcohol that is felt slightly Palate: Body is medium, texture is wattery, carbonation is very soft on palate, finish feel is moderate alcoholic, a bit metaliic and chalky.
Grudziadz Gotyckie Krzepkie 9%;Grudziadz, Poland;Bock - Doppelbock;Browary Grudziadz;500ml bottle. Shared by Tranquillity - thanks! Dark reddy brown. Sweet, almost rotting fruit aroma, hinting on sour. But not in an unpleasant way at all. Taste at first similar. Sweet and a little sour, but with a huge burnt sticky malty bocky taste. Caramel, and almost vanilla. In fact, I could mistake this for being barrel aged, as it’s mellow, quite woody, and with an oaky and walnutty finish. Slightly biting alcohol on the tongue, otherwise quite soft. Very smooth for 9%. Don’t drink this too cold, it’s much mellower warm (12-14C or so). Well balanced and tasty. Very impressed - a big thank you, Tranquillity!
Grudziadz Gotyckie Krzepkie 9%;Grudziadz, Poland;Bock - Doppelbock;Browary Grudziadz;"Bottle, bought in Poland back in ancient times. Dark brown, almost no (white) head. When warm, the aroma is full and cas caramel, raisins, grapes, even cookies. Almost no bubbles, big portwine-flavours, cognac atmosphere and brewed with ""a charm from the brewer"". Surprising!"
Grudziadz Gotyckie Krzepkie 9%;Grudziadz, Poland;Bock - Doppelbock;Browary Grudziadz;A very quaffable beer for such a strong one. Rich flavor with some roasted tones and chocolate in the mix. Not overly complex, but very pleasant. The store down the street carries this beer, I look forward to purchasing it many more times
Grudziadzkie Dobre Piwo;Grudziadz, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Grudziadz;No 298 Rated: 09.01.2008 Bottle brown, 500 ml Appearance: Pours deep golden, practically amber, clear, well filtered, without sediments, honey like, orangy, intense, very nice as for Polish Strong Lager higher standard. head is small to medium initially, regular in structure and rather frothy, rather white in colour, quite quickly decreasing to very small, there are very weak traces of lacing but almost none at all. Aroma: Nice, denoting rich malt content, malted barley, some notes of chalkyness and light alcoholic nose, but as for 9% alcohol is very well hidden, some gentle notes of Polish aromatic hops. Typical aroma of Polish Strong Lager, high standard balanced, good and inviting. Flavour: Coming back to the content of alcohol - 9% it is of course felt, but in fact, very well balanced in. There is a high extract of barley maltsmaking the body heavy, medium to full bodied, sweet and balanced with apropriate level of carbonation and apropriate ammount of hoppy bitterness. Hops are herenot very aromatic but bitter. All in all very good as for 9% but a bit too sweet (not all the malt was fermented because of its high ammount what is said on the internet side of a brewery). One drinkable but enough, something artificial is here present. Palate: On palate you can feel some saltyness, bitterness and some additional harshness, barley grains are felt weaker, alcohol is medium to strong and there is strong sweetness for balancing purposes making this beer less drinkable.
Grudziadzkie Dobre Piwo;Grudziadz, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browary Grudziadz;Draught @ Antikwariat, Warsaw. Fresh spicy aroma, untypical for Polish lagers. Not too strong though. A bit darker than expected, small head. Teaste meady, medium finish. Pear, hops in the taste.

Kvas Monastyrskiy;Odessa, Ukraine;Kvass;TOV Darl;2l bottle from a Russian shop nearby. Taste is bread, malty sweet, probably honey, and the savory element of fermentation. Like.
Kvas Monastyrskiy;Odessa, Ukraine;Kvass;TOV Darl;No esta mal, pero no es una cerveza, ni de cerca. Apaga sed,tiene su bueno sabor,pero es solo una bebida maltosa.

Kvas Monastyrskiy;Odessa, Ukraine;Kvass;TOV Darl;Huge PET bottle. Clear brown, no head, soft drink-like bubbles. Aroma is pretty inviting - bread, sour cherries, cheap red wine, malt vinegar. And then it is a bit too sweet really. But there’s some berries and enough of a hint of acid to make it refreshing. Really a soft drink, but pleasant and has some complexity.
John Harvards Highland Heather Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;From old notes. +++ Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a reddish brown color with a medium sized foamy tan head that left a bit of lacing. The aroma was malty with a bit of vague herbs and perfume. The flavor was nutty, malty and a bit woody with notes of herb and perfume. Medium length finish. Medium body. Solid.
John Harvards Highland Heather Scotch Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Sample at the Pittsburgh location. Pours a dark amber color with a medium thin beige head and spotty lacing. Amazingly floral heather aroma, which was easy to verify as they had a glass of heather at the bar. Some malt in the nose as well. Medium-bodied with a rich malty character, and again the floral heather is predominant in the flavor. The finish is smooth and sweet with a nice aftertaste of floral hops. Hands down one of the most unique beers I have tried in quite some time. The closest comparison I can make outside of beer is to Breitenbach’s Dandelion Wine. I hope to try this again someday.

Craft Smoked Lager;Paiania, Greece;Smoked - Rauchbier;Craft Brewery;From the archives: 2012 October. This was a surprise: smoked pale lager - you do not see that everyday. I hoped for more body, and more hopps. Still it was good an refreshing. Worth a try.

Off-white head. Excellent condition. Fruity malt aroma. Subtle roast and caramel notes. Some tangy hops. Sweetish on the palate with some spicy notes. Herbal character.

Deep, clear chestnut in colour with a billowy white head. Nutty aroma with some bready malts and hint of sweetness.

Custom Brewcrafters CanalTown Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Absolutely horrible. Tasts like someone squirted lemon juice into my coffee and then let it get cold. I love coffee & I love beer, but this is a bad science experiment!
Custom Brewcrafters CanalTown Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;One of the better brown ales I have tried. The coffee flavor come through, but is not overwhelming. The finish is very smooth.
Custom Brewcrafters CanalTown Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;They were not lying about the caffine in this beer........it could just be me, but this made me kind of twitchy. All in all a great brown ale
Custom Brewcrafters CanalTown Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;"(On draft at Aladdin’s in Pittsford, NY) Canal Town Brown is a sparkling mahogany with a fizzy off-white head. It is rather transparent looking and leaves good lacing. The aroma is of sweet malt, medium roast coffee and buttery toffee. It is medium bodied, slightly chalky, not watery, and softly carbonated. The coffee flavor is very subtle. Malt with saltines and butter-- the flavor is a bit disjointed and there’s not really any bitterness to speak of. Maybe some day I’ll ""get"" brown ales-- as for now, all they ever do is make me want a porter! That said, this wasn’t that bad."
Custom Brewcrafters CanalTown Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;Sampled at the brewery. This is an outstanding brown ale. CB has added just the right amount of hops to let the coffee flavor through. If you like coffee, try this ale. As the outside temps plummet, I will actively seek out a growler of this. Nice job! 12/04/06: Re-Rate--Cask at Monty’s Krown. Unfiltered, unpasteurized and hand-pulled. A further polishing of the coffee aroma and balancing of the chocolate malt. Tan head. Flavor enhances as the ale warms. The lacing is heavy and shows each and every swallow. The best brown ale I have had...period. A must try.
Custom Brewcrafters CanalTown Brown Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Custom Brewcrafters;(draft @ Monty’s Korner - Rochester, NY) Dark brown in color with a very thin brown head.

Cambridge ALT-erior Motive;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cambridge Brewing Company;[tap @ Bukowski’s] Pours a dark, hazy brown color with a tan, frothy head. Aroma is sweet, toasty caramel malts. Flavors are dense, sweet malts, sort of chewy and very nutty. Finishes with a spicy bitterness that balances the initially dense, malt-bomb of flavors. Delicious!
Cambridge ALT-erior Motive;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cambridge Brewing Company;Clear, red-copper body with a filmy off-white head. Very toasty nose with Munich malt notes of dark bread crusts and sweet roasted nuts. More toasty Munich malt in the flavor, plus light plum characters and moderate Noble hop qualities.

Cambridge ALT-erior Motive;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cambridge Brewing Company;Draft. Brownish pour. No head but lingering lace from top of glass. Hoppy with notes of chocolate initially and at the finish.
Cambridge ALT-erior Motive;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Cambridge Brewing Company;"Strusselspalt dry-hopped cask, tapped 2 hours before serving, from a tulip, at the brewpub on 8/22/06. Dense, creamy off-white head never falls below cover, and is initially quite large. Strong lacing is left. The body is not quite bright, but almost there, showing just a touch of haze. Very layered color scheme; some nut brown tones, bits of brass, straw and burnt mahogany, with an extremely faint chestnut highlight. Very hoppy nose, but highly aromatic and not bitter/sharp at all, with that robust, tangy German-hop twang, producing various notes of dry grass, hickory nuts, lightly tart cherries and strong leafiness. It’s got a very high strength, which even carries it through the multitude of high-speed ceiling fans that sit above the bar, wisking away aromas. Creamy, smooth malt behind the hops seems to be very balanced in dryness, with just a hint of chocolate dabbed atop light sourdough, with reserved fruitiness adding further complexity. Yeast is rather clean, not distinctly German, if it is indeed so (not sure). Frothy, engaging carbonation brings on a comforting malt body, with perfect attenuation and fruity/grassy, highly flavorful hops. Great integration of flavors. The hops match the malt well, the malt being neither too dry/pale and grainy, nor too dark/sweet and creamy and the hops providing a good mix of lighter, more piquant fruity notes and softer, earthy/leafy notes. Goes down ridiculously quickly, with a light, lingering nuttiness. Let’s see more of this, Will!"

Slightly slick palate; Mouth feel is fair maltyness in pretty thin body. Some surprising light caramel with light tropical fruit ester, fair flower, omnipresent light sweetness. Biscuity and fairly yeasty. Lemon to round. Pretty good!... Hoppiness is floral, lemon and light grass in nose and taste. Bitterness is very notable for a lasting, mid-astringent sweet-bitter finish; Fairly dry after taste. Sweet and fairly bitter to mouth. Comments: The pineapple ester make this one an attraction as well as distraction. It’s nice to sniff and to sip, which hides some of its dullness and works well with the caramel, biscuit dryness and rather notable lemony hops.

Dissipated, white foam head with lightly carbonated miniture bubbles. Golden body. Nose of creamed corn and club soda. Flavour is very smooth, creamy and even with a corn base. Lingering milky finish. I somehow prefer the batch at GCBF a couple of weekends ago.
Hugos Gunpowder Green Tea Lager;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Hugos;Hazy blonde colour. Woody, almost creamy-marshmallowy malts, with a distinctive green tea note. It’s quite malty, sweet, with a grassy tea note in the finish. An odd duck, that’s for sure. I don’t think the concept works all that well here, as I can’t see what changes I’d make to improve the character of the beer but yet I can’t say I like it a whole lot either.

Red Star Frambozenbier;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Red Star Agave Grille;Notes from ABC fest 06. Pours a murky turbid brown with some slight amber highlights and fizzy white head which leaves a bit of lace. Fresh picked raspberries, raspberry jam- fruity esters, and light chocolate nutty hints in the aroma with more chocolate in the flavor to balance the slight tartness of the berries in the end. Overall- this one is loaded up with berry flavor- thcik sweet and toasted malts and a dry chocolate nutty finish with light bitterness.

Pizza Port Great American Brown;Carlsbad, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);January 6th, 2012 - The great American Brown is a great brown, offering up a smell straight up front combing coffee and grass notes with gentle wafts of pipe tobacco fresh from the tin. The aroma matches the wardrobe, which glimmers in the daylight, a dark chocolate lab brown, glossy and also murky. The most notable aspect of the flavor is a long, rolling aftertaste of roasted coffee, served on a mild and soft palate. The rest of the flavor is mostly built of roasted cashew, roasted chicken and a mild and mellow chocolate note.
Pizza Port Great American Brown;Carlsbad, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);28/12/2012 Brasserie 4:20 (tap). Bevuta al Pizza Port Tap Takeover.

Pizza Port Great American Brown;Carlsbad, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Very dark pour. Standard nut brown aroma, but not sure if it is actually a nut brown. Very smooth to drink. Despite its heavy color this isn’t a heavy beer. All around great
Pizza Port Great American Brown;Carlsbad, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);On tap at Toronado San Diego: Served with a thin layer of film for a head while the liquid was a dark almost black color of brown. As for the nose, a nutty and roasted aroma that intrigues the senses as well as my appetite. The flavor is also nutty with semi roasted malts that has a nutty/meaty flavor of cashew or perhaps pistachio. This one of the best and richest brown ales I have tasted.
Pizza Port Great American Brown;Carlsbad, California, United States;Brown Ale;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);On draft (guest) Making a return visit to Lizardville for the tapping of two Pizza Port kegs I opted first for this brown ale. I’m not sure how they made it to Ohio but both were excellent, fresh, and a nice easter egg for those who were looking for a change of pace. I would not complain too much if Port Brewing / Lost Abbey were to break into the Ohio market. Aroma and appearance - The opaque ruby brown body matched the mood of the dimly lit bar. Dense short lived plumes of foam rested on top like packing peanuts in a shipping container. Heavy roasted malts, oak, and a mellow mood felt like a hipster coffee drink from the local grocery store. Flavor and palate - Carbonated and lively this had quite a punch. Warm and woody the feel was soft on the tongue. An ashy finish bit back though - this was not timid and mild. Like licking a dusty floor it eventually leaves a mark on the palate. The hops betray that Pizza Port (ie West Coast) touch. This is a sessionable beer with a regional twist that makes it worth getting your hands on when you don’t want a heady high ABV monster.

Vierling Spring Street Summer Wheat;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;Pours a pale straw yellow with a thin white head. Aroma is bland wheat, and the flavor is similar, but a little less bland. Softly carbonated with a light body. Not very memorable.
Vierling Spring Street Summer Wheat;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;On tap at the Vierling, Marquette. Light, hazy yellow body, thin, tight off-white head. Nose of hay, citrus, and coriander. Sweet. Clean body with citrus and coriander notes finishing with a long, grassy, bitter hops flourish. Another competent beer, but Vierling’s palette could better please the palate with more challenging or non-standard brews.
Vierling Spring Street Summer Wheat;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;Thin yellow, lightly clouded pour, with a rim of white. Flavor a thoroughly savory spiced sugary water, with a tinge of orange. Noticeable coranider, leaning towards Grains of Paradise. Drinkable, but edging on watery. Floral herb notes dominate the finish.
Vierling Spring Street Summer Wheat;Marquette, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;5 oz draft sample at the brewpub, late July 2006. Watery yellow-gold with a small ring of head....very faint spicy nose offers bare wafts of orange, ginger and other cooking spices but you have to work to get it.....much better in the body, well-balanced sweet citric fruity/acidic qualities and sour wheat malt, with enough aromatic coriander and ginger to give it bite....at the end its a bit of an alcoholic 7UP with the strong citric character and heavy carbonation, and it could be fuller, but it was a decent summer refresher if nothing else.
Walking Man Saazsquatch;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Walking Man Brewing;On tap at the Horsebrass. Pours light golden with a small white head. Very floral hop aroma, citrus and spice. Light honey sweetness upfront with a fruity hop finish, light spicy hop crisp ending. Smooth throughout and clean finish.
Walking Man Saazsquatch;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Walking Man Brewing;Amber with lively carbonation, great lacing and a foamy head. Fruit and bitter hops in the nose. Some notes of citrus and grassiness. Wet grass, really. Toasted malts. Flavor really shows the Saaz hops. A little buttery, not much though. Sweet and toasted malts. Lots of bitter berry notes with a great deal of citrus. Very slick palate, almost oily. Sweet and a sticky or coating. Bitter and citrusy finish with a nice balance of malts.
Walking Man Saazsquatch;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Walking Man Brewing;Hazy golden colour. Saaz, heavy bread pale malts, light alcohol, big grassiness in the aroma. Moderate bitterness. Light bready pale malts and heavy Saaz hops in the palate. Again light alcohol in their to dry things out. The attenuation is quite good on this beer, and that I think is necessary in the style to keep it from being an unbalanced cloying mess. So nicely done there, this is really well-balanced. Not the sort of beer I normally like but this is good stuff.
Walking Man Saazsquatch;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Walking Man Brewing;"Tap at the Uber Tavern in Seattle. Pours a neartly clear, slightly oily yellow with a moderate head and great lacing. We’ve got a strong and enjoyable Saaz aroma, but the beer really shines in the flavor; this is just a brilliant bitter hoppiness very different from all of the citrus and resin one gets with the west coast c-hops. Cracker malts provide a bit of a backbone, but this is really all of lovely, pure, grapefruit-pithy hops. Delicious. I’d love to try this one again."
Walking Man Saazsquatch;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Walking Man Brewing;"Had on tap at Uber. They had this labled as an ""Imperial Pils, only keg in WA!"". But, this has to be an Imperial IPA....nothing pilsner like about this beer. The bartender mentioned that this beer was the result of a ""class"" that was taught....not sure on the details. This beer had an incredible skunky hop aroma and taste. This is one for the potheads, I mean hopheads. Amazing aroma and taste...a pure hop heaven brew. A nice bite, but not alcoholic at all. I love it. Pretty thin..."
Exe Valley Rameses Revenge;Exeter, Devon, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Exe Valley Brewery;Cask gravity at the Barnstaple Beer Festival, 19/08/2006. A dark brown colour with a small lasting head. Aromas of honey, chocolate, malt and a little citrus. Taste of bitter dark chocolate, honey, roasted malts and nuts. A little sweetness. A smooth, moderately bitter finish with cocoa and a little citrus. This is uncomplicated but absolutely delicious and easy to drink - my idea of the perfect bitter.

Der Antrunk erfolgt sehr herb und sehr rezent. Trinkt sich anfangs fast wie ein Jever oder Flensburger. Die Mitte wird dann etwas milder, die herbe Note nimmt etwas ab, und der Bitterhopfen schraubt sich etwas zurück, was dem Bier auch verdammt gut tut. Zum Finish hin kommt dann doch noch ein ordentliches Pils raus, das mit einer guten Würzigkeit glänzen kann, von der am Anfang allerdings nix zu merken war, da der Hopfen alles weggebollert hat, hehe."

Herbal and grassy hoppy aroma with touch of lemon. Bitter flavour with a light malty sweetness in the background.

Bitterness is light for an abrupt, very low-astringent sweet malty finish; Slightly dry after taste. Bready and fairly easy to mouth. Comments: This is one of those Helles that hits just the right notes in honey and cookie maltyness, but stop short of being solid in body. Easy to drink, close to decent but can do much better.

Smells of damp earth, downtrodden grains and fresh eggy proteins. Quite fresh, gently floral hop and fruity malt touch underneath a base layer of upfront biscuit-bready cereals. No sulphuric or coarse notes as often appear in this style, makes for another underwhelming well-made, smaller-batch export.

Pours deep amber with a nice head - that goes away fast, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is very malty, but also filling your nostrils with a thick, almost soapy sensation. Some fruity undertones also there. Taste is quite smooth, bitterness mellow. Soapiness still there but also malt biscuits and light bitterness in the aftertaste.

Sabeco 333 Export;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sabeco - Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp. (ThaiBev);Oct 2019. Can while sitting at a table on the pavement outside the Crazy Buffalo bar opposite Pham Ngu Lao. This was my iconic Saigon moment. Loved it. Oh, the beer? Typical global pale lager. But that's not the point. I was drinking 333 in Saigon at a pavement table outside the Crazy Buffalo bar opposite Pham Ngu Lao. That's the point. Iconic. If you're going to drink a beer in Vietnam it has to be 333. Extra points for that. It's not the same if you drink it anyway else.

Sabeco 333 Export;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Sabeco - Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp. (ThaiBev);"Bit of a 'go-to' beer whilst in Vietnam, more available towards the south (Siagon) but still everywhere. This rating coming from the Lauguna Angsana. Large but brief frothy head (for the only one I poured). Golden translucent colour. Corn syrup aroma. Crisp, short palate, inoffensive when drunk suitably cold. #Spiesy-Is-Back - after a long spell off (+10yrs), whilst ratings of good beers increase the enjoyment, paying attention to this ""go-to"" Vietnam staple, has hurt, whilst keeping honest the experience."

As usual, a lot of bread flavors, but also some off flavors such as plastic and DMS.

Piwo Zagloba Beer;Zduñska Wola, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Staropolski;Lightly hazy straw-gold brew, thin, beady head. Funny label. Sweet straw, coldwater malt aroma. Graham sweetness, black pepper, some funny over-sparged flavors, moderate astringency. Finishes with a spittable grain bitterness and a clinging unpleasant sweetness. I search in vain for a lager gem surpise from the Soviet Bloc. Picked this up for $2.29/500 ml at Rosemont Liquors, Rosemont, IL near O’hare.
Piwo Zagloba Beer;Zduñska Wola, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Staropolski;Strong aroma yet grainy flavor with dominating hoppiness. A pleasant yet rich and balanced taste where 6% alcohol overshadowed by vriety of flavors and is not as upfront as in some other pilsners. Slightly weak finish and plain aftertaste. Deffinately a great Polish beer.
Piwo Zagloba Beer;Zduñska Wola, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Staropolski;"Mid-golden bodied with extremely light carbonation. A short, white head fades fast but clings to my Pils glass in a watery lace. A light hint of pine to a grassy, grainy, herbal aroma. Buttery palate carries honey-sweetness with light, bitter hopping. Not a bad beer, and it’s literary reference has sparked in me an interest in the work of Henryk Sienkiewicz. While it doesn’t seem like an easy read, I have added the 1999 film ""With Fire and Sword"" to my Netflix queue Single bottle from Cornfield’s cellar."
Piwo Zagloba Beer;Zduñska Wola, Poland;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Browar Staropolski;I’m puzzled somewhat by the two Zagloba listings. My bottle, purchased in a Polish neighborhood yesterday, is definitely fresh. But the label lists the abv as 6%, more akin to the older version of the beer. Definitely a good Bohemian Pilsener. Golden with a creamy white head and steady beading, it exhudes an aroma of bready malts and light grassy & floral hops. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is a smooth balance between the malts and the hops, finishing on a lightly sweet note.

Citrusy, pine arouma, nice caramel malts. Finishes dry and astringent. A little flat and grassy and some skunk, but not that bitter. I didn’t get much wheat notes from this one. update 7/17 - I think they may have improved the recipe since I last had this: Aroma is awesome floral. Soft body, malty sweet. Fruity citrus. Light nut, some astringency. Smack of bitter @ finish.
John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap @ the brewpub pouring up deep clear copper and off white head. The light aroma is sending out modest notes of citrus and sugary malt sweetness and little else. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a long pulse of malt sweetness that bleeds into orange and tangelo like citrus hop flavor. The citrus comes through and mingles with the light malt backbone creating a very nice flavor. Toward the finish mid to modest hop bitterness helps take this to closure.
John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Pint on tap, Long Island. Pours a hazy golden color typical of a wheat ale. Aroma was very subtle but hints of sweet floral and citrus aromas were present. Flavor was sweet, not very bitter, very reflective of the large amounts of amarillo hops. Palate was smooth, good full taste.
John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at the Lake Grove location. Pours a lightly hazy deep amber with a thin linen white head that faded to a ring after the first sip and left a layer of spotty lace with each sip. Pleasant aroma of grainy malt and fresh pine hops. The flavor is mild wheat up front followed by citrus and pine. Definite hops bitterness at the finish, but not excessive, that lingers for several seconds beyond the swallow. One of the better beers that I have had from this brewer.
John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Update 12/26/2012: It’s been awhile but had this on tap again. Lots of lemony, citrusy notes with bitter hops and pale bready malt in the finish. Tasty, fruity, hoppy pale ale. I still enjoy it! 9/10/2008. On tap at JH. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt. Flavor of nice malt, honey wheat, light citrusy hops, and orange peel with a wheat finish. Tasty, decent, but not very exciting. Plenty drinkable. 7/4/7/4/13 (3.5/5) Update 4/9/09: Had this on tap again. Definitely more citrus hops come to play in this one with a sturdy malt backbone. I don’t know why I rated this a 3.5 before, it’s quite good! 7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)
John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap. Aroma highlights the hops with fresh cut grass and woody pine. Flavor continues with both resinous piney hops and some straight bitter hops. Vague sweet fruitiness kept to a minimum. A mix of good hop action and fairly harsh hop action. Didn’t get me going.
John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;20070428 Tap at TAPNY. Fair beer, a nicely done American wheat with enough kitsch to be interesting. Tropical fruit salad underlying the aromas and flavor. More yeasty notes than most of the style as well as a fuller body and a nice touch of sweetness.
John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at the brewpub on 9/14/07: Transparent bronze with a thin, wispy-lacing white head.

John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap @ Lake Grove: Poured a hazy copper color with a medium sized creamy off-white head. The aroma had fruity hops with notes of oranges and caramel malt underneath. The flavor was full of orange flesh and orange rind. Some semi-sweet malty notes show up. The finish was dry and moderately bitter. Light to medium bodied.
John Harvards Amarillo Anonymous;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Tap at the Lake Grove location. Burnished deep gold colour. Hazy appearance. Beautiful bright orange citrus aroma with light mango and other tropical fruit notes. Flavour shows a lowely wheaty spiciness playing off of the sweet hoppy fruitiness. A touch of caramel sweetness helps brings both together. Soft bitter finish. Warming brings out a touch of resinousness. Very nice brew.

Sackets Harbor Battlefield Brown;Sackets Harbor, New York, United States;Brown Ale;Sackets Harbor Brewing Co.;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a fairly dark brown color with a finger’s worth of eggshell white foamy head that fell off at a decent pace but didn’t leave any lace. The aroma gave off a nice blend of roasted nuts, smooth sweet caramel/toffee malts, crisp dried leaves, some toast and a little bit of earthiness at the end. The flavor leaned into the dried sweetness at first and then developed the roast slightly. Nicely blended aftertaste and finish. The feel was roughly medium bodied, perhaps just a touch under with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine, somewhat low, but that didn’t bother me. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, pretty good brown ale worthy to come back to if I could get it again.

Mac's Mojo Espresso Stout;Auckland, New Zealand;Stout - Flavored;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Tasted a week or so after the release. No date on my notes, but I remember we were on our way down to the Malthouse, where Luke Nicholas was giving away free Monk’s Habit and Epic (Neil Miller was having no trouble accepting them). Two ""pint"" glasses. One freezing cold, while the other sits above the fireplace to warm up. Chocolatey, with a ""whoompf!"" of over-extracted espresso. Other than that it’s smelling and tasting like Sultry Dark. Once it gets warmer, the base beer seems to thin out a bit and show of the mildly unpleasant astringency of the coffee. Overly toasted toast and filter coffee is scrawled in my note book. I liked the idea but think they missed the mark somewhat. Ended up tasting a bit like beer + filtered coffee + burnt toast (true, that’s better than it would be without beer - but only just)."

Little to no coffee characteristics evident, sulphur aromas unpleasent became chocolaty as warmed but still no coffee, disapointing. 2nd tasting at NZ beer awards , much different, extracted coffee aroma like that of the tamping bin, rich slightly cloying but pleasent coffee flavour , alittle light in bodey. 3rd tasting at Backbencher,. muted coffee aroma , still alittle like extracted grinds, rich coffe on palate , diminished bitterness.
Mac's Mojo Espresso Stout;Auckland, New Zealand;Stout - Flavored;Mac's Brewery (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Wow, this really is a knock-out Stout. I’m surprised no one has reviewed it on this site yet as it’s been at the brewery for several weeks and has been written up in the papers too. It looks great, smells of coffee and tastes wonderful. The best beer from Macs so far in my opinion. It has roasty-toasty notes and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The brewery serve it too cold. Buy several pints at once and enjoy them over an hour or two - the flavour improves as the beer comes up from the lager temperature it is served at.
Saint Arnould Dunkelweizen;Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, Canada;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Microbrasserie Saint Arnould (Coop Brassicole des Laurentides);Originally rated November 2006. Pours a hazy deep caramel-red colour with a tanned creamy head that has decent retention. Lacing is minimal and carbonation is average. The nose is beautiful with yeast and spices that reminds me of Unibroue. Mild bananas are present too. The mouthfeel is pretty thin, but it does stick a bit. Light roasted malt is part of the flavours, with some little bitterness and not much aftertaste. Too bad for the lack in the taste and mouthfeel, this brew could of been something special.

Boulder Beer The GABF 25th Year Beer;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Boulder Beer Company;Mid-hazed amber/vermillion under a mostly-holding film of ecru. Yeast, malt & hops find pleasant contrast in the aroma. Organized chaos. Peppers. Fruit. Palate is dirty, dry & alcohol laden. Flavor is tart & yeasty with a fruitiness and deeper bready qualities.

Richbrau Phoenix Farmhouse Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Richbrau Brewing Co. (1993-2010);Clear golden body, white head. Fruity hoppy flavour, sour fruit aroma. I’m not much of a saison fan.

Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Cask sample at WBG Cask Fest 2006. Dark amberish red tones and a nice big head. DIPA resiny pine all over the nose. Huge grapefruityish body with faint malt hints and nothing but hops into the end from there. Even though it seems a bit flatter than it would be on a regular tap, it was still what I would call potent. Yum.
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Brouwers. In terms of hoppy aroma, this might have been the best smelling beer I have ever encountered. Woody, piney, earthy, perfumey, floral, citrus. Pretty much every aroma a hop can give out was there. It was intense as well. Poured a yellowish orange that was pretty hazy. Flavor is super bitter with discernible woody and earthy notes. Hardly any malt, probably some for body. For how bitter is was, it was very smooth. I thought this was amazing!
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Tap at Brouwers Hopfest Sept ’07 Pours relatively pale gold with a fine white head. Lemon and grapefruit aroma, marvelous leafy hops. Flavor is very dry with eucalyptus herbal flavors. This one is all about hte hops, a long, uber-dry finish, deeply resinous. There’s no malt here to distract anyone, but it’s really nice! Relatively light mouthfeel. I could drink this one in reasonable volume.
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Tasted on tap at the 10th Annual Bistro IPA Festival. This IPA pours a cloudy yellow gold color. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is citrusy and floral, a touch sweet. A medium bodied IPA. The malts are fruity and sweet. The hops are citrusy and grapefruity. Nice balance. Crisp and clean. Medium to high on the bitterness scale. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is bitter.
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;WA Cask Beer Fest ’06. Pours deep orange with a tiny off white head. Aroma is faint hops. Big punch in this beer with a big alcohol nose and taste. Piney hops. Lingering pine and alcohol aftertaste.
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Brouwers. Amber hued. Nice citrusy aroma. Big hoppy finish. Nice slightly sticky mouthfeel. Good overall.
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Had at Brouwers Cafe. Small, creamy, off-white head. Not much in the way of an aroma, especially for a DIPA. As the name implies and has described by the waiter, there is a big, long, lingering aftertaste. There is decent amount of carbonation. Not really sure about the aftertaste thing, though.
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Amber with no head or lace. Bitter hops in the nose with some pine. Citrus as well. Toasty and caramel malts. Bitter citrus flavors with some pine and floral qualities. Some heat. Fluffy and a bitter tail with a cloying, floral end.
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at Brouwer’s Cafe Hopfest ’06. Hazy reddish amber with a scant white head. Completely over the top. Just guessing, but the recipe probably calls for starting with too many hops, and then adding more at ten minute intervals. This was my last beer of the nite, and what a way to end up: every dimension of hoppiness in the aroma and taste, and pretty much all at once. Full body and a resinous bitter finish.
Flyers Afterburner Mach 2;Oak Harbor, Washington, United States;IPA;Flyers Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft at Brouwer’s Cafe Hopfest ’06. Dark amber, minimal head and lace. Big piney and resiny nose. Rumors of malt in the palate, but it’s all about huge caustic resinous hop. Just in case you forget that, there’s an almost charred element to the hops. Not from any roast malt--from hops. Not sure how I know this. Enormous lingering bitter finish. Maybe the best resin-driven IIPA I’ve had. The GF says it ""tastes like someone’s shoe in a toaster oven."" I’m guessing this means that other palates may detect a leather note that I’ve missed."
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;650 ml bottle. Pours an amber gold with a white head. Big malt smells with some grassyness. A sweet carmel taste malty upfront with an alcohol taste following and a bit of paint thinner flavor overall. Low carbonation and a very short cloying finish. Not very pleasant.
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;650 ml bottle at a local Indian restaurant. Pour was golden with a small white head. Big and little bubbles appeared. Not very much aroma. The first few sips I was not sure what to expect. After it sat for a bit, the taste was a bit like a Belgian Triple. Slightly sweet with a clean finish. I liked it and would order it again.
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;650 ml bottle with myself on 6th March 2019 while in California, bought from some random English/Indian shop in Forest Lake, Orange County. Pours a misty old gold/orange colour, fast fading wispy white head. Fruity aroma and taste. It's a 'style hopper' being half lager, half Belgian Tripel and half Belgian Strong (OK, thirds of each). Actually it's different and interesting, I liked it.
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;600 ml bottle. Pours golden with fluffy, white head and soda like carbonation. Aroma is of some grassy hops and lemonade.

Aroma of sweetness, grains, and malt. Taste of the same with a bit of alcohol. This light to medium bodied brew was nothing to write home about,
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Bottle. How can you go wrong with a monk on a beer label and a special beer make for beer lovers? Well, I guess this answers my question. I guess this monk was drunk when he agreed to have his picture on a Malt Liquor from India (not that there is anything wrong with India) ...
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Bottle from notes. Didn’t record where just that I should never do this again. Pours a clear dark golden color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have old cream corn, apples, metallic notes, off vegetal notes, skunk, just a mess of a beer. Why?
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Taste is Crisp, malty alcohol boozy, spiced. Gold and clear in color. Oak like malt nose. Medium to full body. smaller head with some lace. This one is a sipper.
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Every once in a while i remind myself of what good beer is like by punishing my palate with a crappy european lager or third world country malt liquor. Today is one of those days! Thins white head of varying sized bubbles that dissapates rather quickly. Interesting arome with cream soda, corn, skunk and some biscuity malts with a lingering synthetic vanilla aroma. Color is like urine after a night of heavy drinking. Taste is about the same! Actually, it is not as bad as i expected. More corn and cream soda and is quite sweet. Lively in the mouth with a noticeable alcohol presence and warming. Dry and a but tart at the finish. Not as bad as i had hoped but certainly not that good either!
Old Monk 10000 Super Beer;Ghaziabad, India;Malt Liquor;Mohan Meakin Breweries;Pours a straw from a bottle, quickly dissipating head with little lacing. Very surprised by this one. Not much aroma, a little sweet rice flavor, round mouthfeel, one of the better pale lagers I've had. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Palate- Medium body with smooth texture but rather high carbonation leaving bubbly finish on the tongue.

Malt and hop balance pretty well in the aroma but it’s let down by some diacetyl. Nice malty flavour.

Snake River Moose Brew;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Snake River Brewing Co.;I came across my notes for this beer while cleaning my basement. I’ve had the empty 12 oz. bottle sitting on my desk since the summer of 2006. I picked this up at the liquor store located under the Mangy Moose Saloon in Teton Village. Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a moderate white head that lasted through about half the glass. Light citrus aroma. Flavor was a bit more hoppy than the aroma would suggest with medium bitterness at the finish.

Milwaukee Brewing Black Russian Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Cask, Full black liquid with a tight creamy tan head. LIght rings of lace mark each quaff, big and small. Full roasted malt aromas, with backdrops of hearty roasted coffee, rich dark chocolate, and aged tobacco. Thin, yet a slightly slippery quality in the feel. Bittersweet chocolate, wrapped with a hint of lightly acidic coffee. A mild sourdough quality toward the finish with a nice dry roasty linger. A nice relaxing stout.
Milwaukee Brewing Black Russian Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Milwaukee Brewing Company;On cask. Beautiful once settled, filling in as opaque, completely and solidly black, with the creamiest, solid tan foam head stretching one inch tall in the English pint glass. There’s some lightening at the edges of the glass as the head recesses, but we’re talking about less than an inch of beer remaining by that time, and after we’re able to peer through the sandblasted dark tan lace. Aroma revels in crunches espresso grinds, dark chocolate undercurrents, blackened cigar wrappers, and a touch of lactic mocha sweetening to preempt a semi-sweet morsel beat. Flavor affirms its stout status with smooth, melting milk chocolate Hershey squares. Casual cask consistency with a slippery, uniform jello scattering when it hits the tongue. Incredibly smooth. Mild Colombian bean roastiness protrudes in the aftertaste, and when the tongue presses upward, a lactic and mocha bean flavor is additionally excreted. Creaminess encompasses more space the longer it sits in the mouth, and when it’s eventually sipped down, a tannic tract lines the middle of the tongue. Roasty grinds linger with a melting milk chocolate melody. Tiny Fuggle-esque bitterness presents itself near the end of the glass. All in all, a decent rendition.

Milwaukee Brewing Black Russian Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Milwaukee Brewing Company;Pours to a pitch black reverse cascading body that took quite a while to settle out. The head is thick, creamy, lasting, and tan. The flavor is sweet, creamy, black patent dryness, coffee. Something comes off as out of place. Perhaps an ultra-light banana? The palate is medium-full bodied and slick. Dry roasty aroma that is not very apparent. At first a ho-hum stout. As I drank more of it, it becomes a pretty average (decent) beer.

Tesco Finest Belgian Abbey Beer;Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England;Tripel;Tesco;Belgian blonde brewed for Tesco, with thinnish, off-white head and bright, deeply orange blonde colour. Aroma of peaches, nuts, young ’jenever’, jute, bread, cognac and wet dog. Taste a dry fruitiness with light citrus acidity, caramelly malts with some spicy yeastiness, finishing moderately hoppy with some gin-like and therefore badly hidden alcohol. Straightforward and not too well-balanced but I guess an okay introduction to Belgian ales for British consumers not yet familiar with them.

Nose high on ground coriander seed, lemon and lime jelly, fruit pastilles, exotic peppery spice, maybe grains of paradise.

Earlier Rating: 5/12/2009 Total Score: 2.8 After 6 months of hopefully scanning the shelves in my local Tesco for new beers, eventually I cracked and bought the only rate they’ve got. Pours too brilliant fizzing amber with a dying white head. Pleasant ridiculous mulled orange and woodsy spice aroma. Thin papery palate with aspirin, cardboard and coriander fizz like Leffe Blonde, but worse. Nectar on top of two bottles of Toon.

Tesco Finest Belgian Abbey Beer;Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, England;Tripel;Tesco;Cork and caged 750ml bottle: poured into three ’La Chouffe’ stemmed tulips on 27 Aug 2013 at my son-in-laws. Looked fine in the glasses, the third one having a darker golden hue than the clear first two glasses: the sediment making the final glass meatier and richer in everything. Good white heads on all three glasses, none however stayed around for any great length of time. Yeasty, spicy, with orangey notes in the nose and taste: this promised so much but fell away as a metallic feel took over the taste. I usually enjoy my Tripe’ls, but this was a poor example and I struggled to finish my two glasses (my son-in-law not wanting more than one glass). The glass with the sediment was better, having more flavour and character, but it still had that annoying metallic note within it’s taste. Overall a bit of a let down for a Tripel.

Courthouse Pub Willinger Wheat;Manitowoc, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Courthouse Pub;After waiting for over a year, I have been curious when the brewpub would have this one available again. On draught at the brewery/brewpub pours a clear pale golden amber brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates to a bubbly white ring. Aroma of bready white malt, a touch of corn syrup, fruity pears and a touch of grassy hops. Taste is a little thin with some white bread and multi-grain malt, a touch of fruit such as bananas, pears and even some peach. Finish has a mild grassy hop and wheat aftertaste that quickly disappears but remains some light pear flavor. An interesting multi-personality wheat ale.
Courthouse Pub Willinger Wheat;Manitowoc, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;Courthouse Pub;Golden color with a fairly think white head. Malt-o-meal aromas and a touch of what seems to be acetaldehyde. Light sweet wheat and a touch of mild citrus. Touch less funk in this one than I seem to find in the others here. Likely one of my favorites here.

White Winter Black Harbor;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;White Winter Winery;Thanks to Kevin for the share at CCB. Nose is ethanol and berries. That’s it. With the big ABV it’s hard to find much else but I’m surprised at how well the currants stood out. Color is a dark red/purple hue that is nice as hell. Each swig was generous portions of spicy alcohol and dark red fruit with a honey finish. On the drier side but still sweet. Not bad at all.

The aroma has lots of alcohol, light fruit and the fruit that is there seems to be on the artificial side. Thick slick body that is quite smooth. The flavor starts with fuesel alcohol, black currents, black cherry and some tartness. The finish is a whirlwind of alcohol heat. Okay, but not my thing.
White Winter Black Harbor;Iron River, Wisconsin, United States;Mead - Melomel/Fruited;White Winter Winery;Holy shit this is fuesel! Aroma is alcohol, dull red fruit, and vodka. Smells like a bum eating cranberries. Taste is vodka-infused, herbal cranberries. Finish is cloying, slightly burning, and sweet. Tastes pretty nice in some aspects, but this needs to burn off some alcohol. It’s like Apis Jadwiga and Night Train Express had sex. Speaking of which, I need to kill the rest of this bottle and go home to beat my wife.

Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry Oak Aged;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;Poured a clear light yellow color with nice legs. Sweet honey and fruity aroma with some candy notes and fusel alcohol. The flavor was light. Light honey, light sweetness, and light alcohol. Big warmth.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry Oak Aged;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;Pours a light yellow color. Aroma is of honey with woody vanilla notes. Flavor is of sweet honey with bitter woody notes, and a hint of vanilla.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry Oak Aged;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;Pours a pale yellow. The flavor is a little on the hot side. There’s a slight tartness in the back and this is a bit more harsh than the rest of the Medovinas that I’ve had. A touch of vanilla from the oak turns up toward the end of the glass.
Medovina Classic Mead - Off Dry Oak Aged;Niwot, Colorado, United States;Mead;Medovina Meadery;No head (still). Body is light yellow. Aroma is notes of honey, minerals, lemon/lime, flowers, alcohol (some isopropyl character), hint of wood. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, flat carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Not a lot of oak character that I could detect, and some higher alcohol is evident as well, but otherwise it’s got the usual bulletproof Medovina characters. As always, I prefer the semi-sweet and dessert meads from Medovina, but this is a class act apart from the alcohol.
Redoak India Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;On tap at Redoak beer cafe. A very good IPA, could do with a bit more bitterness but lovely nonetheless.
Redoak India Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;A rather good example of an IPA. Could benefit from a slightly longer finish, although it is quite smooth. Very enjoyable
Redoak India Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Had on tap at Redoak Clear brown color, off white head, good sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. A bit of ABV legs on the sides. Nose is caramel malt, grapefruit, wood and earth. Not as floral as I expected but a pretty big nose for the style. Taste is quite earthy with a lot of grapefruit. Nice but overall a bit big I felt. Lots of floral and earthy woody notes to this. Oily and heavy feel. Felt bigger than the 6.5% implies. A bit too earthy and woody for my taste but did like.
Redoak India Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Draught, sample, at Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe, Sydney, on July 10, 2013. Clear brown color, teal head.

Redoak India Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;Tap, a bit too cold at RedOak. Orangeish amber, small light beige head. Very hoppy nose - floral, with pine and spice, darkish toffee - smells fabulous. Taste has very moderate sweetness - it’s pretty dry, despite deep toffee. Nectarines, kumquats, mild hard spices. Just a _little_ window cleanerish. Nice balance, but genuinely highly hopped in both aroma and bitterness. Traditional but bold.
Redoak India Pale Ale;Sydney, Australia;IPA;Redoak Boutique Beer Cafe;On tap at Redoak. Review from notes. Pours a deep amber with good creamy slightly offwhite head. Nice looking beer. Good hop aromas with the usual suspects. Plenty of grapefruit and pine needles. Soft light caramel to hold it all together. Flavours are pretty much identical. Soft light caramel sweetness with plenty of resiny hops. OK Bitter finish. Probably my pick out of their beers.
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Draft - Sweet banana and wheat. Cloudy yellow with a decent white head. Light sweet candied banana.
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Definitely a Brewsters original and one of the best they make. Great balance of banana, bubblegum and cloves in both the Aroma and flavor... Love when they come out with this beer every spring!
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Pours a very cloudy yellow as expected from a hefe, small white ring of foam with very little lace on the glass. Aroma is cloves, yeasty/wheaty, banana, and light bubblegum. Taste is banana, clove, yeast and a bit astringent on the finish. Not bad but not great.
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;On tap at the brewpub. A story of banana, in the aroma and in the taste. Banana bits in the mouthfeel, though otherwise smooth, with a bit of astringency in the finish. Lacy, thick appearance. Nicely drinkable.
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Pint on tap at Oliver Square location in Edmonton. Poured a hazy copper color with a small white head and little lacing. Aromas of banana and cloves and some yeast as well. Taste is yeast and cloves with a light sourness in the finish. Nicely carbonated providing a decent mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer, but not one of my favorites from Brewsters.
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Pint @ Brewster’s. 5.2%. Cloudy, orange/honey coloured pour with a frothy white foam, medium retention. Aroma is yeast and bananas. Taste is more bananas , yeast, orange, coriander, and almost a sweet gingery taste lingering in the finish. Creamy, cool and very well balanced.
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;5 ounce sample at the 11th Ave brewpub at 5-beer sampler for $8.50CAD. Very good, even not being my favorite style
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Very cloudy creamy yellow colour with medium head. Aroma of banana, wheat and cloves. Taste was watery, with a citrus lemon coming through. Refreshing but not a great hefe.
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;For this pour I used my German weissbier glass which compliments the naturally substantial head of wheat beers. Gunther’s is unfiltered and cloudy and a nice golden bronze in color. Excellent lacing left on the glass. The nose is of banana, clove, and coriander. There are notes of yeast in the aroma. It is a sweet smell and quite appetizing. There are hints of slightly sweet banana in the taste but it is not overpowering. I can now distinctly taste the large proportion of wheat used to brew Gunther’s and I am a fan. There are some light hops providing a bit of bitterness in the finish. Gunther’s is medium bodied and quite highly carbonated. I almost find the carbonation leads to a bit of bloat in the gut and can slow your enjoyment of this down. At times in the middle of the sip there is almost a little something missing that briefly makes the beer seem watery. Overall - when in the right conditions I love this beer. Namely in the summer heat on a patio or deck.
Brewsters Gunthers Hefeweizen;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Fairly low creamy head and silty tangerine colour. Nose: wheat, lemon peel, young barley, teriyaki sauce. Taste: early cream soda then sour mash, poppyseed, and then more sour mash to end things. This one was off track and its personality did not match its label. Sour dominant and not overly bearable.
Rock Bottom South Denver Flat Foot Copper Lager;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Rock Bottom South Denver;yep it’s a light coppery yellow beer. smells like wet asphalt & wild fields-that’s a good thing for me. taste is an assload of butter, sweet toffee and grain huskiness. finish is not pleasant. plastic, melted metallic.

Wettelsheimer Märzen;Treuchtlingen-Wettelsheim, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Strauss;500ml bottle from trade with Kolshtrinker. Many thanks chap! Drunk whilst cooking a beetroot and mushroom wellington. Pours clear copper, with the thinnest ring of bubbles atop. Caramel on the nose, good caramel to taste with a confident sweetness, a touch slick on the palate, thin body. A little drying on the close, distant cardboard hints, but generally enjoyable. Appeals to my sweet tooth.
Wettelsheimer Märzen;Treuchtlingen-Wettelsheim, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Strauss;50cl bottle. A clear dark golden beer with a mid-sized most good lasting off-white head. Aroma of toasted malt, mild sweet malt and straw. Taste of medium sweet toasted malt, caramel, mild spicy hops. Good!
Wettelsheimer Märzen;Treuchtlingen-Wettelsheim, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brauerei Strauss;Draft at Fränkisches Bierfest in Nürnberg, 2013. Clear auburn. Fine white collar of foam. Nondescript aroma of toasted bread, brown sugar, licorice (Hallertau), plum and a hint of rotting fruit, candy apples and DMS. Firm and pointy carbonation. Initial sip reveals a simplistic maltiness reminiscent of toffee and toasted bread, as a leafy-hop tickle lags behind. Fairly thin, with prominent alcohol thinning out the body. Malt textures never fully bloom, and it’s increasingly flabby akin to wet paper and gummy candy. Merely a suggestion of bread crust. Caramelized sugars are uprooted by an unripe plum twang and a late note of hard peach candy also cripples the malt development. Finishes timidly peppery with licorice-like Hallertau trailed by apple butter, stale apricot, paper, concrete and toast. Pretty defective beer. Not exactly a great first impression from this brewery.

Bricktown Crown Pilsner;Dubuque, Iowa, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bricktown Brewery / Blackwater Grill;Draught at the brewpub. Clear dark golden color with thin bubbly white head that dissipated quickly and left no lace. Distinct grainy malt extracty aroma with a touch of sprucy hops. Flavor was similar with a sour fruity note and a grainy bitterness. There was also a subdued cleaning-product flavor, a bit like bleach. Wish these guys would consider switching to all grain beers.
Gordon Biersch Roggenbier;San Jose, California, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);On tap at Buffalo Gordon Biersch. Clean, fruity, a bit of spice. Very subtle. Should not have had this AFTER the double IPA. I'd try it again.
Gordon Biersch Roggenbier;San Jose, California, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Pours a dark, barely translucent honey-golden-brown with a fairly thick and frothy white head. Aroma is strong, yeasty and malty with an undertone of what must be rye. Flavor is malty and yeasty with some of that rye flavor - not complex but still pleasing and enjoyable. Thick, tingly texture leaves behind a good fizzy feeling.
Gordon Biersch Roggenbier;San Jose, California, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);On tap at Restaraunt. Hazy gold with small white head. Aroma of yeast, malt, rye. Flavor of malt, spices, a touch of banana and clove and some breadyness that is very faint. Odd brew, not much flavor to it like most of GB’s other brews.
Gordon Biersch Roggenbier;San Jose, California, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);On tap @ GB (San Diego) - Pours a hazy golden color with thin white film head. Aroma is yeast, sweet malt, and esters. Flavor is malt and spice. Light to medium body. A decent beer.
Gordon Biersch Roggenbier;San Jose, California, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);On Tap at Columbus Microbrew Fest - Poured cloudy copper with a big offwhite foamy head that stayed well. Aromas of bannana, clove, and caramel. Flavor is bannana, clove, toasted malts, and caramel. Medium bodied with soft carbonationa and pretty unique. Enjoyable.
Gordon Biersch Roggenbier;San Jose, California, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Draft at Columbus, Oh. Poured hazy dark copper with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with very good lacing. Moderate toasted malt, banana and clove aroma. Medium body with a smooth sticky texture with soft carbonation. Medium balanced malty wheat flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. This beer went well with my blue cheese wedge salad.
Gordon Biersch Roggenbier;San Jose, California, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Gordon Biersch Brewing Company (Craftworks);Sampled at the 2006 Southern Brewers Festival. Did not know this wasn’t in the data base or I would have taken more detailed notes about the beer. In any event, I only noted what I thought about it, not alcohol content or commercial description. Pours hazy orange. Smells like a rye based wheat beer with a semi-sharp nose. Odd but drinkable. Sharp rye mellowed by earthy tones. Dryish full body. Not bad.
Bartlett Mead (Dry);Gouldsboro, Maine, United States;Mead;Bartlett Maine Estate Winery;Bottle, thanks to WeeHeavySD for sharing! Pours a very light clear yellow. Sweet and dry aroma, of honey, nuts, and fruit. Very dry, crisp taste, of honey, grapes, and alcohol. Lingering dry honey that ends a bit watery. Different and pretty tasty.
Bartlett Mead (Dry);Gouldsboro, Maine, United States;Mead;Bartlett Maine Estate Winery;750ml from Porterhouse, thanks Kevin! I was just talking about the many Kevin’s I know and now I can add this one. Pours golden pale yellow. Nose is dry and nutty. Taste is sweet, vinous and all in all pretty tasty.
Bartlett Mead (Dry);Gouldsboro, Maine, United States;Mead;Bartlett Maine Estate Winery;Very pale. Aroma is light honey, and dried fruits. Taste is very watery, with faint honey notes accompanied by the alcohol. The alcohol does not show it’s face much, but the lack of depth killed it.
Bartlett Mead (Dry);Gouldsboro, Maine, United States;Mead;Bartlett Maine Estate Winery;"Bottle from porterhouse; Thanks Kevin!!! Nose sm4ells like a muscato desert wine, not sweet but yeasty and fruity! Translucent pale yellow with a coating of ultra fine bubbles on the sides of the glass; flavor is dry and semi-sweetwith honey and white grape notes; finish has a tiny bit of alcohol warmth. Could have almost passed as a cross between a chardonnay wine and a junmai sake. Wish this bottle had been the 375ml and the Bartlett Sweet was the 750ml!"
Brockway Palatine Porter;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Porter;Brockway Chophouse;This draft brew from the brewery poured a medium sized head of frothy light brown colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a no visible carbonation dark ruby red brown colored body. The aroma was malty sweet dark chocolate and dark malt. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The thin yet flavorful flavor contained notes of sweet malt and dark malt. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Brockway Palatine Porter;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Porter;Brockway Chophouse;"On tap at Brockway. Poured a clear mahogany with a short-lived cap of off-white head. Interesting array of coffee, molasses, dark chocolate, and other sugars.. deeper roast to it.. intriguing. Flavor had tasty coffee at the core.. dark chocoate and other deeply-roasted sugars afterward... herbal and soapy notes weren’t as lucrative.. nice coffee again at the finish.. almost a ""7"". Lighter-bodied with mild bitterness... a tad grainy.. OK feel to it."
Brockway Palatine Porter;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Porter;Brockway Chophouse;Pours mahogany/black with a thin, tan skin. Aroma finds a touch of vinegar to coffee bitters and milk chocolate. Alot of raisin in the flavor before smooth roastiness and a hint of alcohol to finish. I couldn’t find the caramel notes as advertised, but I didn’t mind as this was a fairly solid porter. On tap at Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL 60067
Brockway Palatine Porter;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Porter;Brockway Chophouse;Handsome pour, a deep brown body with ruby highlights an a creamy, dark tan head. Heavy lacing coated the glass to the finish. It smells of lightly roasted barley, caramel, milk chocolate, and coffee grounds. I found it a bit thin, but it still delivered a mouthful of roasted, dark caramelly flavors. Not too shabby. Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL
Brockway Grossvater Erlbecker Amber Lager;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brockway Chophouse;This draft brew from the brew pub poured a medium sized head of frothy fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated light orange colored body and a good lacing. The weak aroma was malty. The semi-flat mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The thin flavor contained notes of malt hops and dough. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.
Brockway Grossvater Erlbecker Amber Lager;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brockway Chophouse;On tap at Brockway. Poured a clear lighter golden with a sticky white cap and lacing. Aroma was soft and rather pleasant.. sweet caramel with some floral notes... perhaps a pinch of honey. Soft caramel and honey flavor base with moderate floral and spicy bitterness.. oh-so-slightly toasted.. medium-high pine and floral bitterness through the finish. Just about medium-bodied.. nice consistent bitterness throughout.. felt good.
Brockway Grossvater Erlbecker Amber Lager;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brockway Chophouse;Served a bright, deep golden under white. MIld aroma: pale malt and mild lagering yeasts next to nothingness. Hallertau presence is surprisingly fat, contributing a smooth, constant bitterness to the flavor. The beer has an identity crisis as mentioned, but I could certainly make this a go-to Pils. On tap at Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL 60067
Brockway Grossvater Erlbecker Amber Lager;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brockway Chophouse;To me this came across more like a Bohemian Pilsener than it did a Märzen, which is the style it’s called at the brewpub. I probably would’ve scored it higher had it been called something else. The body is a bright gold with a fluffy white head. The aroma is a sweet grainy malt with a light floral/herbal hopping. Medium bodied, the flavor echoes the aroma, finishing on a crisp, bitter note. Okay, but I question the style. Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL
Brockway Tahiti Matts Light Lager;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brockway Chophouse;This draft brew from the brew pub poured a medium sized head of frothy white colored bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a transparent softly carbonated light straw yellow colored body. The mild aroma was malt hop. The semi-flat smooth mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of corn malt and hops. Not one that I would likely buy again.
Brockway Tahiti Matts Light Lager;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brockway Chophouse;On tap at Brockway. Poured a clear, bright pale golden with a pool and a ring of white head. Mild aroma with sweet pale malts, some honey, and a hint of citrus. Flavor found soft pale malts and honey again at the base with a mild floral and lemony bitterness... crisp and quite tasty. Light-bodied but never watery.. ideal medium carbonation... refreshing!
Brockway Tahiti Matts Light Lager;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brockway Chophouse;"Pours ultra-pale with a short whitey that fades quick to film. No aroma (""subtle"" is right!). Flavor finds a thin, light nuttiness to a lagered sourness. Well made... it is what it is. On tap at Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL 60067"
Brockway Tahiti Matts Light Lager;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brockway Chophouse;This was getting pulled offline at the brewpub because there was yeast in the tank, but that was fine with me. It poured a very pale yellow body, only slightly hazy, with a big creamy head that did some nice lacing. It’s a very light lager, so the malty sweetness was pretty modest, but it was notably adjunct free. It finished a a mild but surprising grassy bitter note. Acceptable warm weather fare. Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL
Brockway Hefe Weizen;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brockway Chophouse;Mid-golden and clear (yes, clear) with a thin white head above. Alcohol does not hide well beneath mild banana and toasty malts. Fairly sticky palate, overtly sweet with banana and citrus notes. Biscuits linger beneath but the finish is both sweet and sour. There were too many factors that threw me off this beer. On tap at Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL 60067
Brockway Hefe Weizen;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brockway Chophouse;This had the look of a Kristallweizen, a clear yellow body with a frothy white head. Very creamy mouthfeel. Like the nose, the taste is full of fresh banana, some soft wheat flavors, a dash of clove, and a light lemon twist at the finish. This is good stuff for Summer weather. Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL
Brockway Sydneys Pale Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brockway Chophouse;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent typically carbonated light orange colored body and a fair lacing. The mild aroma was hoppy. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of mild hops and mild astringency. Notable abscence of caramel malts. Not one that I would likely buy again.
Brockway Sydneys Pale Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brockway Chophouse;On tap at Brockway. Poured a clear medium golden with a short white head and sticky lacing. Aroma was sweet, but I couldn’t peg the driver... some pine and citrus bitterness too.. not complex, but I had trouble pegging some elements. Tacky, sweet caramel and bready malts in the flavor with floral hoppage.. medium-high bitterness.. decent balance. Just less than medium-bodied.. OK flow to it.. some spices on the finish.
Brockway Sydneys Pale Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brockway Chophouse;Soft hop aroma, fruity. Gold body that is mostly clear, slightly hazy. Frothy, off-white head. Excellent lace. Some bubbles. Not very good retention. A pale ale should have more cloudiness like a true ale. Small head also contributed to a relatively low rating for appearance. Not very hoppy at all. A little thin on the palate. Hard to drink. Has a harsh aftertaste. Needs more hops and sweetness. Not a good beer.
Brockway Sydneys Pale Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brockway Chophouse;Served as a pale, bright amber with constant effervescence and a white halo by the time I got around to it. Dishwater & citrus nose is not the most appealing with more orange than grapefruit. MIld honey under a woodsy bitterness and an ABV hit to follow. Tingly mouthfeel with a dry finish. On tap at Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL 60067
Brockway Sydneys Pale Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Brockway Chophouse;Interesting spin on an ESB in that it relies mainly on the hops for flavor... something that appeals to me. It pours a clear bronze body with a pillowy white head. The aroma is strong with floral hops, the sweet malt barely squeezing through. The flavor begins with some light malts, mayhaps a touch of apple, but then the flowery bitterness rushes forward and takes control. The finish is a prolonged bitterness. Not bad. Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL

Hoeksch Tripel;Oud-Beijerland, Netherlands;Tripel;Bierbrouwerij Hoeksche Waard;Clear orange pour, small head. Aroma is malty, too malty, with faint yeast and fruit. Flavour is too sweet of malts with fruit. Disappointment.

Hoeksch Tripel;Oud-Beijerland, Netherlands;Tripel;Bierbrouwerij Hoeksche Waard;Dark blonde color, cloudy. Anis, cake dough and malt in the aroma. Sweet, rather alcoholic flavor with anis and vanilla. I prefer the aroma to the flavor.

Wildwood Wit;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;So successfully received last year, this was brought back as the summer seasonal once again. Murky straw yellow with a thick dense merangue of a head that demonstrates excellent retention. Fresh zesty lemon and wheat aroma with a vaquelly vanilla quality as well. Mildly sweet and spicy, wheaty, with a refreshing citrus note and a soft mouthfeel. Very well done!
Wildwood Wit;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;I really like the pints of this I had during the World Cup. The beer was refreshing and had a nice fresh spice flavour. I even bought 20 liters for home. At home there was a strong lemon butter flavour that I hadn’t noticed in the pints at the pub. 6 weeks later I found the same notes in a pint at the brewpub and switched to the Pale. Rating is a bit of a split between fresh and lightly aged.
Wildwood Hefe;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy blond color; creamy head. It has a sourish aroma and a quite dry mouthfeel, a bit acid as well, and very little wheat character. Refreshing."
Wildwood Hefe;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;(Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival 2007 in Victoria on September 8th, 2007. ART-Y-FIC-IAL... Nose of yeasty wheaty base. Minor apple flavour with a cider basis. Bad. 4/3/4/1/6. Re-rate: (Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival in Victoria, BC, September 8th 2008. Thin, white foamy head atop a cloudy golden body. Nose of tart, wet wheat and cardboard. Clean, mild and spicy flavour. Not the best example of this style but passable. 3/4/7/3/13
Wildwood Hefe;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;Hazy yellow. Light banana, marshmallow and melon on the nose. Thinnish, grainy, slightly acidic character. OK, but that’s it.
Wildwood Hefe;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;After the seasonal offerings of kolsch and witbier ran dry, they have treated us to this little gem. A hazy honey yellow with a creamy white head. Banana and a touch of vanilla aroma. Mostly banana in the palate, very subtle spiciness, and a citrusy tartness to the finish. Nice.
Wildwood Hefe;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Wildwood Restaurant & Brew Pub;Yellow and with more aggressive spice than Brian’s Wit. Just a touch of the butter notes that were in the Wit at the end of the batch. I hope that this one ages a little better. A nice refreshing beverage a week before it hits the tap. Surprising in that it is the same yeast as Brewsters new Hefe.
Stonefly Six Fingers IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stonefly Brewery;On tap at Stonefly brewpub. Murky amber with a thin off-white head and some lacing. Aroma of grapefruit, pine, caramel and heavy floral hops. Hopped up and hoppy. Taste is a grapefruit burst mixed with some orange, mild pine and caramel. Moderately bitter on the finish along with mild acidity. As an IPA, this one set out what it was suppose to do and did not disappoint.
Stonefly Six Fingers IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stonefly Brewery;Sampled on draught at the GTMW ’08. Pours a semi-clear golden orange brew with a thin white head that quickly dissipates to a thin white ring and some spotty lacing. Aroma of a good balance of caramel malt, grapefruit and citrus zest with a touch of pine. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonated with a more grapefruit flavor that hides some of the caramel malt flavors. Finish is mildly IPA bitter with a light aftertaste of grapefruit and citrus zest. Pretty much an average IPA overall.
Stonefly Six Fingers IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stonefly Brewery;On tap at Stonefly. Poured translucent orangey-golden with a short cap of white head. The aroma picked up nice doses of grapefruit and caramel with a touch of pine.. juicy!.. weak off-notes of vomit threw me off, but this was otherwise solid. Juicy orange and grapefruit bitterness steal the show in the flavor (which is a good thing).. pine provides more bitterness on the back-end.. grapefruit meat and caramel support all this hoppage well.. bitter and tasty overall. Well-balanced on the palate, and the lingering bitterness stuck around for a while.. warm, yet refreshing.
Stonefly Six Fingers IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stonefly Brewery;On tap at Thirsty Troll Brewfest As things wound down I decided to give this a shot. The pickings were slim by now for finding new beers and I wasn’t quite ready to fall back to the Ale Asylum standbys. This was a complete contrast to the Two Hearted. Whereas it embodied all the possibilities of an IPA this one barely passed muster. It’s not bad for a brewpub release but it doesn’t set itself apart. Aroma / Appearance - The body was a golden wheat color that was just a little different. Active carbonation percolated to the top regularly. Grain, caramel and hops formed a creamy nose that was inviting but not unique. It lacks the punch one normally associates with an IPA. Flavor / Palate - Unlike the nose the body is all business. I was immediately able to pick up the bitterness which hangs around a long time. Cookie dough, citrus and string pine notes kept me busy before the fading finish. It wasn’t a bad IPA but it just felt a little unbalanced.
Stonefly Six Fingers IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stonefly Brewery;Cloudy orange body, foamy white head. The bitter side of resinous grapefruit hops and lightly sweet crystal malt make up the aroma. A tasty pale malt base undergirds the same strong grapefruit rind and plant stem hohps. The bitterness is approaching harsh because it’s a dry beer and there isn’t a lot of citrus flesh hop flavor. Still, it’s very drinkable and well balanced.
Stonefly Six Fingers IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stonefly Brewery;"Listed as 7%. Pours to a very hazy caramel amber body with a thin white head. The aroma is hard to distinguish over the nasty stale cigarette smoke air. I about gag from the sheer amount of nasty smell in this brewpub, and there’s only about a dozen people here and nobody’s smoking. WTF! The flavor is bitter grassy pine hops. Bitter oily resins linger in the sharp palate. Quite decent for $2.50 a pint at a bar. The palate is ""harsh"" with tons of oils. This one’s a drinkable local brew when you want to go out, get hammered, and only spend $15 all night. Aroma definitely affected by smoky atmosphere. This brew is up there in IBU... 80+."
Stonefly Six Fingers IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stonefly Brewery;This poured the appropriate color for an IPA...it is an amber color but lacked a sparkling brilliance that is usually present in professionally produced beers of this style. The head was rather weak and didn’t linger. The beer smelled faintly of hops, and had an expected hop bitterness. However, this taste was accompanied a sourness that was off. Mouthfeel was a bit flat and watery. I didn’t find this beer very drinkable.
Stonefly Six Fingers IPA;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Stonefly Brewery;Hazy Dark amber color with a moderate off-white head. Orange and yeast aromas. Dusty yeast flavors that I found in the IS as well. Woody and dry malt flavors Quite traditional.
BJ's Helles Bells Bock;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On tap. Very light golden in colour with almost no head. Malty and slightly sweet. A bit grassy and maybe a weak hint of caramel. Kinda refreshing.
BJ's Helles Bells Bock;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Tap @ Mesa, Az. Location. Malty and sweet aroma. Dark golden body with thin head. Flavor was maybe overly sweet as some bock’s can be for me anyway. Some toffee flavor as well. Medium bodied beer that left a candy toffee aftertaste on palate.
LongNecks American Pilsner;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;Straw color with a flimsy white dissipating head. Scents of dough and light wild flowers. A touch of soap in the background. Not sure if it’s the glass or the beer, but either way the lack of substance shows. Light malt and grain flavors. A hint os green hops come in the middle and departs quickly. Hit and run brew.
LongNecks American Pilsner;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;On tap at brew pub. Again, This place is great food but they have to step up on the beer! Light yellow/golden color. Smell of light hops, bread, citrus and a little toasted malt. Tastes the same but very light and watery. Almost tasted like a lite beer from Miller. Refeshing, YES, but won’t drink it again.
LongNecks American Pilsner;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;Available on tap only at the brewpub near Waukesha, WI. Pours a clear, light golden pale brew with some lacing and no head. Aroma of very light citrus hops, some wonder bread dough, and saw dust. Taste is watered down, highly carbonated, and a too clean finish. Hardly any aftertaste to this. I have no doubt it’ll keep the diet beer drinkers happy.
LongNecks American Pilsner;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;On tap at brew pub. Pours a dark yellow/aber color. Has a slight bready/hop aroma to it. Taste of what a homebrewed pilsner would taste like. Slightly watery,but very drinkable on a hot day.

LongNecks Amber Grains of Wayne;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;Dark copper to light brown color with a diminishing off-white head. Mild caramel aromas with a backdrop of some earth and weedy hops. Flavors seem to match the aromas with a touch of toasted grain, light caramel, with earthy hops coming in the middle. Quite thin in both flavor and feel.
LongNecks Amber Grains of Wayne;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;"This beer’s name is actually called ""Longneck’s Amber Grains of Wayne"" named after Wayne S., part owner and brewmaster. Pours a hazy light brown brew with a fast dissolving off white head. Aroma is minmal with some caramel, light grassy hops, and earthy malt. Taste has some character of cardboard, earthy bitterness, and some-what watered down carbonation. Light body is any. Finish is more like a pilsner than a amber ale. Probably one of the brewpub’s best brews."
LongNecks Amber Grains of Wayne;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;On tap at brew pub. light brown color with small whitish head.Hard to pick up any aromas maybe a little malt. Has a nice malt flavor with a hint of hop bite. A little watery though. I would say this is there best brew.
LongNecks Amber Grains of Wayne;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;Another watered down brew from Long Necks. Some caramel maltiness of the tongue and a small amount of East Kents are apparent as well. Not a good representation of the style.
LongNecks Endless Summer Light Wheat Ale;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;On tap at the Longneck Brew Pub. Served with a slice of lemon. Poured a lighter and cloudy golden color with a small sized head. Aromas of sweaty wheat and some citrus (from the lemon?). Tastes of wheat, citrus, and grainy. Fizzy, light and thin body.
LongNecks Endless Summer Light Wheat Ale;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;On tap at Longnecks Brew Pub. Pale yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of corn and perfumed malts. Flavor of corn, lemon, wheat all wrapped up in a thin body that’s too bland and astringent.
LongNecks Endless Summer Light Wheat Ale;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;Pours hazey light golden body, hardly any distinct nuances in the aroma. Very plan, and watery. Over malted- trying not to be too critical, but it was a sad representation of this style.
LongNecks Endless Summer Light Wheat Ale;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;Lightly hazed, light straw color with a somewhat fizzy white head. Seem to catch more glass cleaner soap than beer aromas. Some hint of citrus and maybe a touch of wheat. Watery wheat and and light citrus flavors. Finish is dry and again watery. A mix of an american wheat and a weak pale lager.
LongNecks Endless Summer Light Wheat Ale;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;Available only at the brewpub on tap. Remember to ask bartender to place lemon off to the side. Pours a light clear pale golden brew with a fast dissolving white head. No lacing. Aroma has hardly any scent. Just barely any citrus and hay to the nose. Taste is very light body, highly carbonated, and watered down beer. Hardly any wheat taste. Finish is clean and no after taste. At least the lemon will give it some flavor.
LongNecks Endless Summer Light Wheat Ale;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;this stuff is crap.. boring water... not worth the rating... thank god I was coming down from a skydiving rush or I’d have been really po’d

LongNecks Endless Summer Light Wheat Ale;Vernon, Wisconsin, United States;Wheat Ale;LongNecks Brew Pub & Restaurant;Very watered down wheat beer, faint aroma of grass. Clear blond color. Really nothing here, a wheat beer for the masses.

Wettelsheimer Heller Bock;Treuchtlingen-Wettelsheim, Bavaria, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Brauerei Strauss;Hellmalziger und deutlich süßer Antrunk, in dem die Herbe fast etwas verloren dasteht. Honigartig süß im Mittelteil, dazu leicht bananig. Zum Ende hin auch etwas alkoholisch, was das Malz unterstützt. Insgesamt ausgewogen. Harzig, hellmalzig aromatisch, hintergründig hopfig, was schwer vom hellen Malz zu trennen ist. Ein nicht unbedingt komplexer, insgesamt aber gut gelungener Bock mit ansprechender Intensität, zumeist vollmundig.
Three Cats Yarlington Mill SV Cider (Draught);Ilkeston, Derbyshire, England;Apple Cider;Three Cats Cider;Polypin at Merton Summer Beer Festival 05-07-07 Tried this before the beer festival started. Poured a warm golden colour and was very interesting to contrast the appearance of this single varietal cider with the Olivers version of the Yarlington Mill the latter was much lighter. Plenty of nice scrumptious apples in the nose taste was crisp and dryish but nice apple flavours swishing around, this was very good from the East Midlands only cider producer (so I’m told)

Seidr Dai Perry - Medium Dry (Draught);Cardiff, Wales;Perry;Seidr Dai;From the barrel - Peterborough BF. A gereeny white coloured cider. The aroma is slightly medicinal.

Aroma of apricots, hops, some candy-like sweetness, some hint of malt. Super smooth mouthfeel, barely any carbonation (probably due to the cask), slightly syrupy (in a good way).

Master Svetlo Pivo;Novi Sad, Serbia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Brauerei MB (United Serbian Breweries);Ein helles Bier, das angeblich zurzeit (2019) in Novi Sad gebraut wird. Es hat einen recht flachen Körper, der hinten raus etwas interessanter wird, da erst jetzt die Hopfenbittere einsetzt. Angenhem ist, dass es nicht den gleichen Einheits-Balkan-Geschmack hat, aber ein Spitzenbier ist es deshalb noch lange nicht.
Master Svetlo Pivo;Novi Sad, Serbia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Brauerei MB (United Serbian Breweries);Pours a clear golden, topped with frothy white head, poor retention.

Sonny Barger Sonnys Lean & Mean Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pours a transparent pale golden with a thin-lacing wispy white head. Aroma of lightly sweet sugary pale malt and a touch of noble hops. Body starts with a thin, sugary grainy maltiness with a touch of fruity esters before a mildly bitter finish. Pretty sweet for a pale lager, but uninteresting and sorta thin.
Sonny Barger Sonnys Lean & Mean Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;A very light lager with nothing special going for it. However, there’s nothing bad about it either. No weird flavors or skunky smell, just a decent light lager.
Sonny Barger Sonnys Lean & Mean Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle from bockyhorsey, a very generous rb’ian. The pour was, well, pale lager-like. Need I say more? The aroma was corny with some off-notes of something or other. Grains very subdued. Skunk was tame, maybe some slight grass. The flavor followed, some sort of an astringent off-ness to it all, but heck, this was a pale lager, what more could I have hoped for? Mouthfeel was pale lager-like. Thanks, Bill, always fun to try a new one!
Sonny Barger Sonnys Lean & Mean Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pours a clear straw color with slight white head that goes quickly. No aroma that I can notice. Flavor is I guess okay for style since that is what I am trying to rate to. But it just has a bit of straw malt flavor. No hop presence at all. I guess not too bad for a light/pale lager. But a little more flavor that the big 3, I guess. Thanks bockyhorsey.
Sonny Barger Sonnys Lean & Mean Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Pale gold color with a bit of fizzy head. Basic sweet grain aroma, a little grain silo-like. Clean, grain taste. There really isn’t much to write. No off flavors, just simple grain. It’s like if MGD or Bud were decent beers.
Sonny Barger Sonnys Lean & Mean Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;12 oz Bottle. Aroma was matalic and corn and a lemon note as well. Yellow body with white head that disipated rather quickly. Starts out cool and crisp and of normal swill beer. But by the finish the malt thicken up and it was to the point you had a stale metal vat taste on the palate. Not the best beer in the world but cool label. 4/2/3/2/5=1.6 Thought I hadn’t had this one and picked one up on a beer run. Aroma was like passing by the malt house on I-94 in Milwaukee. Yellow body with white head. Flavor didn’t have that metalic taste but just a good refreshing swill with moderate bitterness.
Sonny Barger Sonnys Lean & Mean Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;Bottle poured a clear yellow with a quickly disapating white head. Aromas of lemon, straw and corn. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of straw, light lemon and a hint of corn with a crisp clean finish. Label says Sonny Barger Brewing Co. but since Sonny light is under Huber I guess this is where it goes. I knew it would be another boring pale lager but being a motorcyclist and having met Sonny I was curious what kinda swill he put his name on. It was’nt quite as bad as I expected.
Sonny Barger Sonnys Lean & Mean Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;"Bottle reads ""Sonny’s lean & mean Premium beer"" under the moniker ""Sonny Barger Brewing Company, Monroe, WI"", so I assume the actual brewer is indeed Huber Brewing. Well, this isn’t that bad for a light beer but for the most part it still seems like a cheap macro. Seems to have some raunchy machine oil elements, though it’s not a drainpour. Try it if you can find it, but mainly for novelty."
Dry Dock Old Ironsides Barleywine;Aurora, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dry Dock Brewing Company;At the 2007 Big Beer, Belgians, & Barleywines Festival in Vail. Great CO barleywine! Pours dark brown to ruby black in color with a thin off white head. Fruity caramel aroma with raisins and dates. Candy apple fruity malty sweetness has a near perfect balance of hop bitterness. This is remarkable smooth for the stated alcohol. You’d think it was alcohol-free! Thick mouthfeel, but not saturating. Just a very technically well-made BW.
Dry Dock Old Ironsides Barleywine;Aurora, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dry Dock Brewing Company;tap at the brewery. dark copper orange body. aroma is peaches, plums, alcohol, and syrup. this is hot. alcohol really bites at first, this fades as it warms and some other flavors emerge. supersweet, some bitterness in the finish, but the fruit comes through on top of everything. peach syrup, it really reminds me of the syrup from canned peaches. cherry lingers with a note of alcohol.
Dry Dock Old Ironsides Barleywine;Aurora, Colorado, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Segfault bottled this one at the brewery for me. What a guy. What a birtday present! It pours dark reddish brown with a skim of white bubbles. Looks thick and mighty! Aroma is extremely malty. Lots of caramel and dried fruit. Hints of spicy hops. Taste is marvelous. Tons of malty goodness. Great balance, though not as hoppy as I’d prefer. Still, a really interesting maltiness. Some toastiness toward the back of my tongue which is made more interesting by the hops back there too. Lots of caramel and fruit toward the center and tip of my tongue. Man, this is interesting. The alcohol is really well cloaked by the malts, and the thickness and sweetness of the malts is really well cloaked by the hops. It’s a rather deceptive combination. It lends to a really smooth beer. I’ve never had a barleywine as clean and smooth as this. If I were to offer any criticism, I’d say I kinda wish it were a little less reserved. Give me more of something - hit me with some more malts or surprise me with some more hop character. Still, all in all, an impressive barleywine. I can’t wait to see what Dry Dock comes up with next!
Flossmoor Station Black Wolf Schwarz;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Objectively speaking: A brown lager that lacks the usual house confidence. I like: Not very tasty at all, rather pale coloured. Very light bodied. limited roastiness. Clean, but mostly dull. I dislike: Mostly sweet palate, but never really choosing a direction, avoiding fruitiness and wandering into the cerealic side of things. Not much lager character, no crispiness.
Flossmoor Station Black Wolf Schwarz;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft... DLD’08... Very dark (almost black), clear ruby red with a large, frothy, white head. Creamy, tight retention. A merger of cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon comprise the aroma. Medium-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and bristly carbonation. Well-balanced, nicely roasted and very drinkable. Good bitterness prevents overwhelming sweetness. Roasty, nutty finish.

Very dark color with some short lived tan foam, no lacing. Lots of dark malt in the aroma, very sweet smelling. A bit too thick in the mouthfeel for a Schwarz IMHO, almost resembles a hefty brown ale, lots of esters, not very lager like to me.

The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with minimal carbonation. Another winner from Flossmoor.

Small and creamy, semi-stable white head. The flavour is a little sweet and very slightly sour. Supposedly plum flavour, it reminds me more of some sort of candy. Not a gueuze, but tastes OK.

It is far too bitter for my taste.

Tahquamenon Falls Blonde Beaver Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was on tap at the brewpub. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a light golden yellow color with a quarter finger of white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds. There was barely any lacing. The smell had some light sweet bread. The taste sweet and lightly bready with a light aftertaste and watery finish. On the palate, this one sat pretty light. Overall, not a bad beer, just nothing over the top.

Coarse carbonation clings to the walls. Light aroma of sweet pizza sauce sugars. This beer has carbonation! Hooray! A first for this brewery. Flavor is quite palatable. There’s a sweet clean sugar of grain edges and thick wheat. It’s smoothes out with some brandied pear hops in the end. A touch thin, but right on for the style. Some diacetyls on the smack bring it down. Otherwise, certainly the best offering by this brewery.

Tahquamenon Falls Black Bear Stout;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Comparatively speaking, this could be their best one. Here’s why. At the brewpub, this was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a dark brown to black color with a quarter finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. The lacing was there but didn’t show much of anything to stick as it slid for the most part. The smell had a fairly decent dried and roasted coffee bean to light chocolate. The taste was mainly the same thing with a really dry aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body. The carbonation was really subdued as it let the beer have a decent drying effect to cover my mouth and tongue. Overall, this was a nice interpretation of an Irish dry stout.

It’s light and a bit watery with fine carbonation and a light, roasty finish. It’s alright but could use more intense flavor and more body.

Tahquamenon Falls Black Bear Stout;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap...First thing that I notice is the complete lack of carbonation.

Tahquamenon Falls Black Bear Stout;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. I found this beer to be quite drinkable. I also find water to be quite drinkable. Very thin and watered down.

Big Horn Shagbark Farmhouse Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);On tap at Ram in downtown Indianapolis (served ice cold in a frozen glass :( ). Poured a clear medium golden with a short layer of white head.. some lacing. Spicy yeast focus in the nose when it finally warmed up... white pepper provided a kick and some light fruits attempted to push through as well (apple and pear)... too much spice focus, though. Coriander, cloves, and bananas make the first impression on the tastebuds... lots of spicy yeast... sweet lighter fruits, white pepper, and alcohol drive through the finish (more spices, too). This never really established an identity on the palate... heavy spicage on the front and back with an almost empty middle.

Klein Duimpje Dubbel Chocolade Stout;Hillegom, Netherlands;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Huisbrouwerij Klein Duimpje;"Warning! My bottle was a sample from the second trial brew. If the commercialized product proves different, I’ll try a new rating. Fully hazy brown with red-amber highlights; small yellowish, very fine head as whipped cream, leaving rings of lace. First impression is leafy/earthy, then an overwhelming onslaught of chocolate, dark chocolate powder and cacao booms. Quite bitter taste, chocolate, but also quite some hops. Malty, nowhere sweet, until after some serious warming up. Dry beer, a bit fizzy. In the aftertaste, warming up, some mild melassy sweetness. The chocolate reigns in the aroma, but is very meek in the flavour. Whatever, nice beer."

Jasper Union Blonde Ale;Jasper, Alberta, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Jasper Brewing Company;On tap at Jasper Brewing Company. Poured a clear, very pale golden with just a ring of white head.

Jasper B Hill Pil;Jasper, Alberta, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Jasper Brewing Company;Draft - Sweet perfumy grains. Gold with a rich white head. This is not like any pilsner I have ever had. So much perfumy grains, sweet with little bitterness and not as crisp or refreshing as I would like.

Earls Albino Rhino Dark Ale;Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada;Porter;Kamloops Brewery;On tap at Earl’s, rating this from memory as it’s been a while. This was surprisingly decent - light, but fruity and flavourful, with a decent balance and an interesting flavour. I would not call this a porter, but as a brown ale or even a mild, which would make more sense, it was pretty good. Some nice dark fruits and a balanced bitterness. Would try it again if I found myself at an Earls.

Appearance (3/5): Dark cola color in the glass, with a small, quickly diminishing, off white head with good lacing. Aroma (4/5): Dominant burnt grains and lemon, with notes of orange, cardboard, and perfume. Taste (4/10): Moderately sour and lightly bitter, with a short, bitter finish. Tastes very watered down. Palate (1/5): Medium/light body, lively carbonation, extremely watery texture. Honestly feels like carbonated water. Overall (7/20): Honestly I was surprised at how bad this was.

Drinkability: 4/5. Character: 2/5. Buy Again: Definitely No.
Moccasin Bend Juniper Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;On draft when visiting the brewery before Noogfest High Five. Clear, slightly darker yellowish hue than the welterweight. Defintely more bitter, and fruity. Certainly has that piney weird ’gin’ flavor. I can’t stand gin, so I really didn’t care for this too much
Moccasin Bend Juniper Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;Brewpub sample. Poured cloudy gold with a lacing white head. Aroma is sweet, floral, and pine. Taste is a little hoppy, with plenty of pine and floral notes, as with the aroma. Another unique brew from Moccasin. Body is middle of the road, with average carbonation. Finish is sweet and a little bitter.
Moccasin Bend Juniper Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;Draft sample at brewery.

Moccasin Bend Juniper Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;Bomber split with NachlamSie. Pours yellow with whitish head. The aroma is steamed carrots, juniper, some pretty unpleasant veggies, orange peel, and some cucumber. The flavor is better, with notes of light malt, some fruity hops, and noticeable juniper. There is some organic plantiness to the finish. Questionable beer.
Moccasin Bend Juniper Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;Bomber shared by Tronraner. Pours a light gold, just barely hazy. Smells bad. Smells like boiled carrots, eggs, hay, vegetation, and there is finally a dry juniper note. I’m really dreading the flavor, but I find it to be forgiving. It is vegetal and spiced, but reasonable. Hints of yams, mild bitterness, accessible esters, and a finish of weak gin. This is fair, though smells awful. [January 16, 2010] On tap at the brewery. man, this is so much better this time around. The glass I had today is nothing at all like the bottle we drank awhile back. This doesn’t even look the same. It is very light yellow with a small white head. This is probably the lightest in color pale ale I’ve ever seen. The brewer informed me that during different seasons he uses different malts. This batch apparently has Pilsen malt. The palate is quite light with just a crisp malty flavor which really lets the hop and juniper flavor out. Overall, this is a clean drinking ale with adequate citrusy hops. For such a light bodied ale, I really liked the flavor on this one. I adjusted my score from 2.6 to 3.2.
Moccasin Bend Juniper Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;Tap at the brewery. My favorite from these guys.

Moccasin Bend Juniper Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;Pours with a heavy haze. Bubblegum esters are evident in the aroma. Very much like a hefeweizen, but several of the brewery’s beers were showing some noticeable yeasty esters.
Moccasin Bend Pumpkin Seed Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;Pours clearish copper with white head, lots of lace. Aroma of spice, roast pumpkin seeds, citrus hops. Taste is pretty interesting, with the pumpkin seeds strangely complimenting the citrus hop flavors. Spice is relatively subdued, with light sweet backbone. Finish is nutty and bitter. Overall, an interesting take on APA. A beer I would try again.
Moccasin Bend Pumpkin Seed Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;From a batch with homegrown hops. Hazy brown-orange, whitish head. Aroma is caramel, light toasted pumpkin seeds, citrusy hops. Taste is again citrusy, spicy, light toast and caramel. I think I like these after they sit on the pumpkin seeds for a lot longer.

Appearance:Clear amber pour with a thin white head. Aroma:Sweet malt and grass with a faint hint of pumpkin seeds. Flavor:Sweet malt with a mild bitter finish. Not bad, but not very exciting.

Moccasin Bend Pumpkin Seed Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;"2008 Southern Brewers Fest . Cask. Amber pour. Creamy light tan head. Bitter, nutty aroma. Smells like ""green"", untoasted malt. Flavor of bitter hops, bold malt. Slight notes of spearmint in the distance. (Having to search for tasting notes for this beer). Kinda forgettable. Finishes with a deep tannin bitterness, too much for an American Pale Ale."
Moccasin Bend Pumpkin Seed Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;Tap at the brewery. Apparently the end of a batch. The body was dark amber. The pumpkin seed dominated the aroma was some roast and nuttiness. The taste was pumpkin seeds with some light grapefruit. An interesting brew, especially surprising is now little pumpkin seed it takes to add that character.

Moccasin Bend Pumpkin Seed Pale Ale;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;on tap. Pours a cloudy copper with a nice white head. The aroma is quite strong with definite nutmeg, subtle pumpkin, some citrusy/lemony hops. The mouth is slightly sticky with a nice clean caramel backbone. The nutmeg comes out in the finish and light lemony hops ring throughout the drink. This is surprisingly good for the style. It cuts the difference between being overly spiced or bland. And thanks to the hoppy character, this still tastes like real beer.

Dark Star Greenwich Ivebin Piloct Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);"Tasted at the Evening Star, Brighton, East Sussex. A mix of Dark Star’s Hophead and Sunburst, it’s even a brighter brew than the parents. Appearance: pale golden in colour, the clarity is as great as a true believer’s conscience; a monk’s rimmed beer head sits on top of a pool of still nectar. Smell: sweet, ripe white-grapefruits and plenty of flowery & lychee-fruity American-hoppyness... Not terribly complex, but really like Hophead with added fruity edges and sugary malts. Taste: an initially bitter-sweet edge of grapefruit zest gradually gives way to an intensifying bitter and dryish edge of raw, flaky hops... the considerable bitterness expands on the palate knowing no limits, almost like the aftertaste and after-mouthfeel of Chinese dried-herbal medicine soup--no offence though, instead the vertical yet clean bitter palate is one of the most lively and impressive I’ve encountered in the world of Bitter; simultaneously lots of hops lend an overwhelming aroma lingering in the mouth... Utterly enjoyable from the first second of tasting to the very last. Palate: extremely light-bodied, very much like Hophead in a sense, and lively textured with a healthy dose of fine fizziness on the palate... I can’t believe a mix could be this good and tasty, even better than its parent-brews in terms depth as well as freshness... Absolutely a brilliant beer in its own right."

Nethergate Wild Goose Bitter;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;"Tasted at the Black Bull, a freehouse nr. Whitechapel, East London, dedicated to Nethergate’s beers. Presentation: pale amber hue, great clarity; a thin white head settles to a rimmed foam and low in carbonation. Smell: faintly sour-sweet peary fruits, a focused yet understated flowery scent of hops, accompanied by a very softly sweet nougat and caramel note of malts. Simple. Taste: very light grapefruity and slightly peary hops on top of floral flavour and mildly savoury maltiness; a more subtle nutty malt flavour at the back gradually turns dryish, tea-leafy, leaving a bitter-sweet and soothing finish. Palate: great carbonation, soft and light-bodied Best Bitter. Worth a try when one sees it, otherwise not so special to seek out."

Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Easily my favorite Otto’s offering so far. Rich and bold with complex characteristics in the aroma, flavor, and finish. Surprisingly drinkable for a beer this bold and rich. Lovely stuff.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;12 oz On-tap in a tulip shaped glass My first review although a long time experimenter/taster. Appearance- a nice brown deep brown color. The beer clung to the side of the glass while swirled. Smell- delicious Bourbon barrel aged aroma. A little bit of fruitiness (although can’t pinpoint exact fruit) and a sweet aroma of chocolate. Taste- A bit lighter then would be expected for a 10 % abv, but very flavorful none the less. The barrel flavor is overwhelming, but welcoming, with a nice afterglow of other more standard stout flavor. Mouthfeel- good but a bit lighter then would be expected/anticipated. Overall - This was was very enjoyable brew to drink. Would recommend to anyone who likes a good imperial stout and will definitely experience again.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;On tap at brewpub. Black with thick dark tan head that retains for a long while. Aroma is bourbon, chocolate, oak and vanilla. Flavor is a slight letdown compared to the aroma but still nice: bourbon, chocolate and oak, but a simultaneous barrage rather than a nice progression. Finish is long and a little too boozy. Very nice overall.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Tap @Otto’s: Pours a rocky, brown head that exhibits good lacing atop a black body. Aroma of pine, milky taste and mouthfeel, medium body with a smooth taste profile. Very excellent.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;An extravagant thanks goes out to Nate for this special brew! Had the pleasure of sampling this at the 7/9/2009 Pittsburgh RB tasting extravaganza (PGHRBEXT) at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse. It will be a long time, if ever I see a spread of bottles like I did there. I am not good enough for the beers that were that we served! For example, how about this beer: a hand bottled ottos B A jolly roger! Dark black glass staining oily appearance. Dark roasty aromas. Surprisingly there is some carbonation in this brew. Sweet initially then goes impy strong. Typical strong impy stout on style characters thru the rest of the session. Way too much personality for this lager lover. Almost rude tripel or barleywine in its nature. What else can be said about this brew but ON STYLE!
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;"Had this one at the RB Pittsburgh tasting. This one was hand bottled from a hand pumped growler, so I curved quite a bit on the final impression. This one is a lot better than it’s individual character scores would show. The mouth is where I want every stout to be. Lots of roasty bitterness here in scent and taste. Bourbon is at a good level. Let me clarify since re reading the above could be misconstrued; I only mention the less than ideal bottling situation to illustrate how well it held up. That was also taken into account when giving numerical scores. It should be noted and quite obvious that what I had was not what was intended, but it works."
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;This poured a very dark brown pretty much black with a small tan head. Aroma was licorice, smokey, and roasted grains. Flavor was very very roasted, some smoke notes, and a long lingering bitterness. Bourbon notes were there, but not overwhelming at all and fit very well. Damn good beer.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;[On cask at Ottos] Appears black with a small brown head. Aroma is pretty nice--chocolate and anise mainly, with a touch of coconut, and a little roasted malt that came out as it warmed. The taste has a lot of anise again, some acrid roasted malt, cookie dough, and some chocolate, but not as much as in the aroma. Wow, this is only 10%? I love high alcohol beer, but this thing did the worst job of hiding it that I have ever seen. Palate is tough for me to judge, as I don’t really know how being on cask is supposed to change them. It had extremely low carbonation, bordering on being completely flat, medium-thin mouthfeel, and a long finish. It was very smooth. Perhaps it is because of my lack of experience with cask ales, but from a purely hedonistic perspective I was quite underwhelmed by this beer. The taste did sort of grow on me a little the longer I drank it, but it was hard to get past the over-the-top alcohol burn that came with it.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Pours a dark cola colour with frothy light brown head which leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, malts, coffee and bourbon. Tastes of chocolate, malts, coffee and bourbon. Has a slightly bitter taste that improves as it sits.
Ottos Bourbon-Barrel Aged Jolly Roger Imperial Stout;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Imperial;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Pre-DLD tasting: Opaque and oily in appearance. The aroma has notes of bourbon (vanilla, oak, booze), chocolate, ashy smoke, green tea, molasses, and a hint of lactic sourness. The taste starts with the expected sweet malt character of chocolate and roasted malt, hints of vanilla bean, dark fruity (fig and prune),herbal hop, pepper, and a hint of peat smoke. The mouth feel is oily, heavy and lush. A solid brew all told but not quite the level of the top level BA Impy’s IMO.
GB Tafelbier Tripel;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Haacht;Bottle. Clear pale yellow colour with a medium frothy head. malty aorma and taste with grassy notes. Nice beer. Easy drinkable, but watery. Triple?
GB Tafelbier Tripel;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Haacht;Food white head, fast disappearing over clear gold, big bubbled beer. Very malty nose with greenmalt and a bit grassy. And very dull. Watered down pale malts, retronasal warm summer grain. And sparkling water. Very thinnish. Aftertaste has a very slight hoppy bitterness. This might sound all very bad. Put to put this into perspective, I’ve had some (quite some) foreign lagers that weren’t any better...

Valley Brew Sunshine Daydream Saison;Stockton, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Valley Brewing Company;I’d have to say that this is probably my least favorite beers from the VBC line-up. Saison’s can be so hard to make, and I applaud these guys for trying. However, comparitively speaking to their other beers it has a way to go before it catches up. Aroma was a bit spicy, slightly peppery with hints of the coriander they used in brewing. Appearance was a medium/dark orange. Mouthfeel was satisfyingly light, not harsh in any way and nothing offensive like. Flavor was a bit vegetative for me, but I could also detect some white pepper, bitter oranges and grain. A decent attempt and I’m sure they will work out the kinks and get this beer working soon.
Valley Brew Sunshine Daydream Saison;Stockton, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Valley Brewing Company;Extremely delicate and soft on the palate. Has notes reminiscent of a good Viognier. Floral and fruit forward wth an effervescent mouthfeel. Wonderful session beer that demands to be quaffed.

The nose is very rummy owing to the barrels that it is aged in, and yet this didn’t overun the taste which was still fresh and relatively crisp and with the apples still shining through. Really enjoyed this cider.

Light, almost delicate on the palate.
Seifus Tej;Watkins Glen, New York, United States;Mead;Lakewood Vineyards, Inc.;This mead seems to have some sweet honey apricot flavors with a medium finish. The sweetness is somewhat balanced and the texture reminds me of a glaze. This is made for the Ethiopian royal family from what I’m told and has to fulfill certain requirements.

Moccasin Bend Watermelon Wheat;Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Moccasin Bend Brewing Co.;From a keg at the unfinished brewery thanks to Chris. Poured a slightly hazy medium orange with a rather long-lasting whitish head. Aroma had a fresh watermelon seed character on top of a pleasant lemony wheat base. Flavor found about the same stuff.. the watermelon was fresh and the base moderately tart. Crisp and refreshing finish. Note: per Chris, the canning machine went nuts and a whole bunch of the cans out there are more water than beer. This was really a solid effort.

Just like it’s a style that I’ve never had before and I discover right now.
10 jaar Dickies 1996-2006;Moen, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Alvinne;"Bottle, 33 cl. Blond- almost amber color. White head. Very special beer. Aroma is not bad, koriander, and other spicy. Medium body. Taste is a little too much spicy, the boss thold me it’s ""komijn"". Like the other Alvinne beers more."
10 jaar Dickies 1996-2006;Moen, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Alvinne;Rocky head, foamy, filling the Alvinne Glass. Sitting here witha a daft dash sniffing my leg, I realised that this is the dog on the bottle. Perhaps there is a dog in the bottle, considering the aroma. Spicy, rather than hoppy. The flavour continues the spicy theme, not asian, just odd, curious rather than appealing. Found myself drinking this to finish it.... Not great.
10 jaar Dickies 1996-2006;Moen, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Alvinne;"Huge, fluffy head, yellowish over fully hazy orange-ochre beer. Pungent spicey nose - lavender? Like a desinfectant, but with a natural herb. Lavender again, going over in an outspoken bitter almond flavour. The spices & almond completely overwhelm anything else. Some sweetness; retronasal citrus, soapy. Good point: somehow it’s refreshing. Medium bodied. There’s just too much of this lavender thingy. Pity, because a bit more balance might have yielded a much better beer."
Sirakami no Kyou Namachozo Sake;Hirosaki-shi, Aomori-ken, Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Marurtake Shuzo;"After drinking several of the Niigata/Hyogo style drier sakes, it is nice to have another of my ""hometown"" sakes. Well, actually, Momokawa and Oroshi are much closer to my former home but this is still Aomori-Ken. These are usually a lighter, fruitier sake than their southern counterparts. I’m not nearly as good at describing all of the subtle flavors as Jordan but he pretty much hit the nail on the head with this one. Aroma wise, not much to write home about. I pick up the fruit and what I’d have called some cheesey scents (lactic sounds so much more palatable) but the rich lightly sweet, doughy flavors more than make up for the mild bouquet. Nutty follow, but I didn’t get the whole breakfast buffet! :-) Nice feel, smooth and easy going down, no rough rubbing alcohol taste here!"
Sirakami no Kyou Namachozo Sake;Hirosaki-shi, Aomori-ken, Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Marurtake Shuzo;300mL Bottle: Pretty tough to find this one online, but there were several references, something about a special release. It pours a clear color with light beige legs and a nice spritsy character. The nose is minerally with some peach and anise, some lactic notes and a light koji grain note along with a decent amount of alcohol. The flavor is rich with umami, nice body and a light sweet candyish flavor, even though it’s only +1, which is just one single point into the sweetness side of the road, it’s very subtle and nice. The rest of the sake is really fresh and tasty but not much in the nose or floral department. Whoa, after I drank about half of this, it started tasting like walnut banana pancakes smothered in butter and maple syrup, it was delicious! Thanks Dan, you rock!
Miyozakura Namachozo Sake;Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Miyozakura Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Cleaning out my fridge and what do I find? This little gem that I picked up in Gifu Prefecture on my last trip through mainland Japan before I moved here to Okinawa. As Jordan said, an off yellow, like a mild Jasmin Tea. Light alcohol and the buttery quality he described. Slick feel, thick & chewy, I want to use a spoon! Very rich and creamy, peach yogurt comes to mind. This makes me realize how much I’ve missed drinking good sake.
Miyozakura Namachozo Sake;Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Miyozakura Shuzo Co., Ltd.;300mL Bottle: Pours a light yellow color as you can tell from the picture. Some people say clear is the way to go, and clear is pretty, but some good color shows that the sake wasn’t filtered heavily (physical or chemical). Some spotty legs and light creamy swirls. The nose is full of floral buttery nama with some light melon and pancake. The flavor is sweet, balanced, light alcohol, lots of umami and sweet maple banana notes. Mmmmm, nama. A light alcohol pinch in the tail with a more creamy mouthfeel. Finishes balanced, brief tail. Surprising for the low seimaibuai on this sake. Thanks Dan!
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;DATE: September 14, 2017... OCCASION: Thursday night relaxation... GLASSWARE: Ayinger willibecker... what is immediately noticeable immediately is its thick, pillowed white head that holds a three-finger stance until it laces with robust thickness... reasonable effervescence makes its way through a dark red body--fitting for a fest... the aroma is dank with caramel, dough malts, with some noble hops suggesting spiciness (licorice? pepper?)... some pine too, with vegetable also present... a thin, oily feel with some flourish at the throat... swift in its passage, with little texture to speak of... light bodied, with an apologetic softness that tingles--odd mouthfeel that causes one to wonder why... the caramel is not so heavy as it is lithesome and sweet... the flavor profile is much like its aroma, with the caramel sweetly piquing the taste buds... iced tea, mint (?), grainy woods, and apple/pear sweetness... overall, a flat, sweet approximation of what an Oktoberfest should be... a borderline rinser... serviceable, but not worth seeking out this season...
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;Pours hazy amber with a very quick head. Nose is a little boozy with a good bit of fall spice. Flavor is similar and shallow with a very strong alcohol profile considering it’s relatively low content. Finish is cloves and a little spice. Very unbalanced and heavy for the style.
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;Transfer from BA review on 9-5-13- Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a nice copper/deep amber color with a one finger fizzy just off white head. The head fades quite quickly leaving only a very light foam on the top of the brew and a light persistent foam floating atop the brew. Smell – The smell is of a roasted malt with a good dose of caramel sweetness. Other sweeter aromas of some apple and a bit of cherry as well as some aromas of a more spicy nature with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg round out the smell. Taste – The taste begins with a bit of a roasted malt and a rather strong caramel sweetness. These flavors create a base for the beer lasting, throughout the entire taste. As the flavor advances from the beginning to the end, light flavors of apple and some spice comes to the tongue. In the end, a little bit of a citrus and herbal hop taste comes to the tongue with a slight intensification in the roasted malt flavors, leaving a somewhat sweet but lightly roasted and spiced flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel –The body of the beer is on the slightly thinner to average side with a carbonation level that is a bit on the higher side. A little thicker of a body and a slightly lower carbonation may have been better for the roasted malt flavors of the beer, but the combination of the two (thickness and carbonation) did do a nice job for the sweet and fruity flavors of the brew, so overall it was quite acceptable. Overall – A rather enjoyable and quite easy drinking oktoberfest that comes at a great price. Rather nice overall.
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;Definitely better Oktoberfests out there in the world. Drank out of a bottle so couldn’t tell you the appearance. Hope to have it at the Brewery sometime in the near future.
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;NOt very good at all. Light caramel colored. Some malt, and very thin overall. This one was dialed in and lacks the palate and full bodied malt of a higher-quality oktoberfest.
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;"THOUGHTS: Not bad, but not great either. Nice and sweet but not enough hops to balance all the malt. TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium amber with a small, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma had lots of different malts. There was heavy, dark bread, cookie, toasted, caramel, sugar water, honey, cake, and graham cracker like malts. There was also light grassy hops and slight cardboard. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and slightly bitter; while the finish was heavily sweet and lightly bitter with an average duration. The medium body was syrupy and lightly fizzy with a dry and slightly astringent finish."
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;12 ounce bottle from Total Wine Virginia Beach. Pours a clear copper color with a foamy tan head. Good head retention. Aroma of caramel malts, candied citrus, toasted malts. The taste is toasted caramel malts, anise, faint fruits, mild hops. Medium bodied. Generic, but solid.
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;Rich amber color with a quickly dissipating white head. Nose is malty with a little banana and some disruption by something else (almost agave or smokiness). Somewhat thin bodied and quick finishing, it has tastes of dry grain and corn with a little booziness coming through even though it’s not a particularly high abv. Less expensive than some Oktoberfests on the shelf next to it, but tastes it.
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;Bottle from b3shine. Poured clear brown color with a minimal frothy off-white head that was mostly diminished with fair lacing. Moderate toasted sweet malt aroma. Light to medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Light to medium sweet flavor with a light to medium sweet finish of short to moderate duration. My expectations where met.
Stegmaier Oktoberfest;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lion Brewery;12oz. Bottle from b3shine. Pours clear amber with small white head. Sweetish grainy malts, light fruity, mild toasted. It is what it is. On my phone so this is short.
Valley Brew Ocktoberfest;Stockton, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Valley Brewing Company;Really nice, caramel-imbued, medium roasty aroma with a narrow swath of tidy hops (lightly floral). Lightly sour, finely burled maltiness. Round, ebullient grainy finish, light bitterness. Good stuff.
Valley Brew Ocktoberfest;Stockton, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Valley Brewing Company;Very soft nose with a nice mild noble hop note and some lingering caramel and a slight touch of sulfur. Clean and inviting mouthfeel that begs to be quaffed.
Tucks OHoly Hops;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tuck's Brewery;Pours amber with a thin white head. Citrus and pine hop aroma. The hops are floral with a strong bitter finish. Crisp and dry with lingering grapefruit aftertaste. Very nice hop profile without being painfully bitter. Slight excess yeast flavor in the finish.
Tucks OHoly Hops;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tuck's Brewery;"Tap at Uber Tavern. Pours a very nice clear orange-amber with a lovely white head and good lacing. When we were kids, we’d stick a hollow peppermint stick into an orange and suck all the juice out; that’s how this one smells and I rather like it. The flavor is rich with a strong and long-lived bitterness, mouthfeel is slightly hot and oily. I’d enjoy trying it again."
Tucks OHoly Hops;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tuck's Brewery;Amber with a small head and great lacing. Very fruity nose with pine notes and lots of caramel. Almost a note of bubblegum with citrus. Bitter and piney flavor. Strong caramel and toasted malts. Some yeast, but overall not a lot more I want to say about this one.
Tucks OHoly Hops;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Tuck's Brewery;Golden amber colour. Woody-mouldy-mossy...a really strange aroma. Quite bitter, mossy, woody and very toasty. A light alcohol back note. Rather strange, to say the least. Certainly not the citrus bomb you’d expect, and I don’t like that it almost feels like it’s got a stale cigarette smoke note to it.
Silver City Nutcracker;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Silver City Brewery;Very dark pour with a white head. Sweet malts, dark ripe fruit, candied sugars, and light peach. I didn’t pick up much of the peel or spices they say are here. The booze is well hidden. A good winter warmer.
Silver City Nutcracker;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Silver City Brewery;I thought this was one of the best (porters?) I’ve had in a while. Sweet, rich, chocolate, and fullness to the mouth. I’ve been meaning to talke to the brewmaster to brew this again. The one I had was 2006.
Silver City Nutcracker;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Silver City Brewery;I bought this bottle several weeks ago at Uber and drank it at home last night. Aroma is toasty, nutty (toasted pecan), and malty sweet with hints of chocolate and dark cherry. Also has a spiciness to it, like a root beer, with licorice and anise aromas. Appearance is rich red mahogany, clear, with a medium off-white head that tries to lace. Flavor is malty, sweet, rich, and spicy like a cross between a Belgian dubbel and an Aventinus. Has a Belgian candi sugar sweetness and some slight dark fruit notes. Mouth feel is medium-bodied, with medium high carbonation, giving it a little crispness. Some alcohol warming. Malty sweetness lingers in the finish. Overall a well-made Belgian style dubbel that is slightly light in the body.
Silver City Nutcracker;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Silver City Brewery;Bottle shared with Oakes, glkaiser, and Sham at Uber Tavern in Seattle. Pour a deep brown and provides a sweet nutella aroma. The beer is far too sweet in flavor, think Thai iced coffee, with few other redeeming characteristics -- a bit of nuttiness, smoky/salty hints, rather sticky mouthfeel. I won’t be a repeat visitor.
Silver City Nutcracker;Bremerton, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Silver City Brewery;Dark brown. Chocolatey aroma, nice light toffeeish note. Hints of coffee, light chocolate. Subtle maltines but bland.
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;Cask at SRAF. Pours hazy pink, nose is tart raspberry, wheaty, taste is juicy, fruity, dry.
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in June 2007. Cask, handpump dispense. Cracking colour with russet and goldne ruby depth tones like Arran sunset. Thin white head. Slight hint of ripe rasberry in the short aroma. Thin but refreshing mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malt gives a strong fruit base of rasberry flavour and very much like a flat Frambosen. Hops are in scant evidence in the short aftertaste. Sweetness continues into the malty finish. A pleasant summer session fruit beer.
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;Cask @ The Sir John Moore JDW. Rich golden amber colour. Mild dry raspberry aroma & flavour. Bitter aftertaste. Not very fruity.
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;A Mes rate: Cask at some random JDW in Glasgow. Unattractive red amber colour with a crappy white head. Egg and sulphur nose with very slight raspberry. Flavour is that of a lifeless ale with some very faint unidentifyable fruit. Yes ok of course it’s raspberry but I would never have guessed if I didn’t know. Sticky palate, especially in the finish. Gotta love the Cask Marque assured quality beer at JDW...
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;Cask @ Crystal Palace, Glasgow. Soft beer with a fine berry flavour, sweet, while not cloyingly so. I rather liked this, but it was more interesting than great, perhaps. One glass is enough.
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;Cask conditioned at Merton Beer festival ’07. Pinkish brown with slight head. I do struggle with fruit beers, my wife loved this but I find them a little challenging. Yes, the Raspberries were very evident and fresh tasting and the Witbier background was also evident, but I cannot overcome my, probably prejudice against them.
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;STBF07. Aroma hits you with tart rasberry, excellent xactly what i want, then the rubbish beer cuts throguh it and distroys what could have been great. Taste is tart real rasberry juice, then again a terrible overly malty backing offends me. Could have been a great, but loses it due to the terrible beer base.
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;Edinburgh Beer festival 2007 ... Light orangy pink colour ... fruity fresh raspberry nose ... light fresh raspberry juice with a light touch of hop.
Traditional Scottish Ales Red Mist;Stirling, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Black Wolf Brewery;Cask, Dick Whittington pub, Gloucester, 02-09-06. Loz (partner) had this first and I was that impressed I had to have one. Poured a very red/brown colour and with a noticeably fruity berry nose this beer was a real turn up as I’m not usually that struck by fruit beers. The label described it as a wheat beer with the addition of locally grown raspberries, the raspberries were very evident and really added and improved but in no way did they ever overpower, we both agreed that this was very, very refreshing and really different but both felt that a half or pint would probably be enough. Wonderfully different beer.
Wychwood Goldwing;Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Bottle from Sainsbury's, from old notes. Poured pale gold with an average sized just off-white head. Aroma of citrus hops, malt, lightly floral and grassy. Medium plus sweetness, moderate bitterness.

Clear golden to amber colour, decent head. Fairly nice aroma, floral and fruity with notes of honey. The flavour is zesty and fruity, there is a noticeable sweetness, again with notes of honey and also marmalade, acceptable hops in the finish. Not bad.

Plevnan Oktoberfest;Tampere, Finland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Koskipanimo;Draught at the Plevna, Tampere, Finland. According to the waitress this is the non-organic version. Clear golden colour with a small white head. The aroma is apple cider, sweetness and malt. Strange. The flavour is dry grainy malt, nutty dryness and sweet alcohol. Not my favourite.

Plevnan Oktoberfest;Tampere, Finland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Koskipanimo;Ulkonäöltään kullankeltainen ja hieman samea olut on tiivisvaahtoinen. Haju on maltainen, hieman makea ja hedelmäinen. Maku on raikkaan kukkainen ja sitrushedelmäinen sekä hunajaisen makea. Suutuntuma on ohut, mutta hiilihappoinen. Kokonaisuutena raikas ja helposti juotava olut sopi hyvin saksalaisten makkaroiden seuraksi, muttei tämä itsessään mikään makuelämys ole.

The Dunkel starts very malty and roasty well, with a subtle aftertaste of sweet malts. The finish is strong malty spicy. To finish it’s even a trace of more sweet malts, but the roasted note determined by the end of this beer. Delicious thing!

Hessisches Löwenbier Hefe-Weizen hell;Malsfeld, Hesse, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hessisches Löwenbier Brauerei (Hütt);18-Aug-08 (500-ml bottle, Best by 19-Nov-08: Free sample bottle for stewarding the 2008 World Beer Cup in San Diego, CA) Cloudy pour of bright golden-yellow body, but the streams of large carbonation bubbles move incredibly swiftly up the tapered weiss bier glass. Ugly forced carbonation, but this improves over time as the carbonation settles down and the bubbles become smaller and more leisurely. The voluminous whitish head is over an inch in thickness and shows solid retention, though the bubbles aren’t especially tightly knit. Simple, mildly aromatic nose of lemony citrus, black pepper and doughy bread, but also a touch of cheesiness and a hint of plastic phenolics. Light and mildly flavorful on the palate, the entry is tart, lemony and peppery, the finish is heavy, bready and gently tart, with some sweet banana and a touch of clove in the aftertaste. The beer lacks complexity or depth, and the flavors are generally light and uninteresting, though balance is reasonable. Light-medium body, trending toward medium, with medium-strong carbonation. The citrusy acidity keeps the breadiness at bay into the evolution, but once the acids fade off the palate, the beer starts to feel a bit flabby. A fat ring of lace remains at the top of the glass with sporadic strands below. Not bad, not good, just there, bland and innocuous on the palate. Probably best served cold as a summer quaffer, it certainly won’t distract you from your conversation.

Tastes like a Belgian; yeast, apricot, apple, and bright citrus. Has a very slight spice bitterness on the end. Kinda odd for me."
Dry Dock Marin Saison;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Quaffed over the summer repeatedly as i stopped in Dry Dock’s tasting room, this is an excellent example of a Saison... happens to be in the real farmhouse style, meant for the ’worker in the field’ -- meaning the 4.7% (if I recall correctly) alcohol is intentionally low so one may enjoy a lot of it. Nice aroma of spices, malt and ’saison-ness’, wonderful appearance. I enjoyed it a great deal. Most other Saisons I have had have been abnormally high in alcohol for the style (not that that is a bad thing, just out of style). Color is actually only a little lighter than Saison duPont, although both are much lighter than the crazy-big saison by New Belgium. With a little more spice note on the tongue and just a touch more body on the palate I would have rated it even higher.
Dry Dock Marin Saison;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Dry Dock Brewing Company;At the 2007 Big Beer, Belgians, & Barleywines Festival in Vail. I’m not sure who let this dog into the Big Beer festival. It by no means has the muscle. Fairly clear pale yellow with a white head. Some spicy coriander aroma, but body and flavor is rather mild. A very slight peppery tingle to the tongue and otherwise drying finish. Ho-hum.
Dry Dock Marin Saison;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Draught at brewery. Pours very pale yellow with a large frothy white head, mostly diminishing, excellent lacing, clear and sparkling body. Aroma is heavy malt (grain, hay), light hops (flowers, grass), light yeast (sweat, leaves) with notes of banana. Light bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Long duration, light sweetness and acidity, moderate bitterness and salty. This is likely the worst interpretation of a saison I have ever had.
Dry Dock Marin Saison;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at the Dry Dock Brewery Tasting Room. Poured a very light and clear straw color wtih a smaller sized white head (doesn’t look like saisons that I’m used to). Aromas of lemons, citrus, and peppers. Tastes of lemons, fruity, citrus and peppers. All around on the thinner and weaker side.
Dry Dock Marin Saison;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Slightly different experience on this beer as the only other rating. Light malt, of course, and moderately hoppy with herbs and citrus filling my nose. Slight toffee and maybe cola as well, but a clear aroma of bubble gum enticing me to drink. Brilliant clear body of light yellow hues, average head for this beer of a white color dispersers almost all together. A closer look shows small particles suspended in this thin-bodied saison. A moderately acidic and lightly bitter flavor on my tongue, the lively carbonation is satisfying. The medium body give way to a dry and slightly watery texture. As it slides down the back of my throat, I feel a light astringent taste and the hops intensify making this a very enjoyable and refreshing beer. I think I will get a growler next time I’m in.
Dry Dock Marin Saison;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Draught at the brewery. Body is very light yellow (not far from colorless).

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Light body, watery texture, soft carbonation. A very light, watery, and rather bland rendition.

Lightning Kolsch Style Ale;Poway, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Lightning Brewery;November 29th, 2014 - Lightning Brewery’s Kolsch is a cup of little crisp, dry joy. Straw colored and light, it gives off the slightest smell of cereals and grains, though it is almost invisible, thanks in part to the tiny sampling cup I am making do with. The flavor is slightly bitter, but features a very long aftertaste, which is both clean and crisp.
Lightning Kolsch Style Ale;Poway, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Lightning Brewery;Tap at the brewery.

Schwanen Pilsener;Grossostheim, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Eder & Heylands Brauerei;Clear, yellow colour with a mid-sized foamy white head. Medium to light bitter flavor, light body, slim and slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Nothing special here, a less then average outing for a German pilsener. I haven’t too many bad beers here, but this one is below average.
Schwanen Pilsener;Grossostheim, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Eder & Heylands Brauerei;50 cl bottle. Rated on 20.10.2010 A bit dark-yellow color, thick and disappearing head. Basic aroma to pils with butter. Rather harsh hops in the flavour, also some butter. Too much CO2 on palate, the harsh hops linger in the aftertaste. Not my kind of pils.
Schwanen Pilsener;Grossostheim, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Eder & Heylands Brauerei;0.5 l bottle. Golden color. Malty aroma with herbal-peppery hops in the background. Dry malty flavor with herbal-peppery hops and hint of metal. Dry crisp bitterness in finish. Not very fresh bottle (BB Dec 2010) but still fairly enjoyable dry pilsner.

The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;Quality beer with a light finish for a darker porter— some aftertaste though ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;12 ounce bottle. Opaque dark brown pour.msmall creamy tan cap. Rich roasted malt aroma is reminiscent of prune and Worcestershire sauce. First sip has notes of soy sauce and roasted portobello mushrooms. Subtle notes of licorice, balsamic vinegar and plums. Medium bodied as you would expect for a Baltic Porter. Complexity grows as brew warms. Outstanding!
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;Bot. 2014 vintage Aroma: not super complex but with neat depth, coffee, soy sauce, alcohol, and coffee. Look: poured dark brown, smallish tanned ring on glass of foam. Palate: full bodied, smooth, creamy, slight side astringency. Taste: soy with mix of dark chocolate and coffee. Perhaps a bit past its prime. Old school feel.
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;Black hue with a thin light beige cap. Nose has a light touch of soy sauce, soft German pretzel, dark roasty malts, a kiss of licorice and a semisweet touch of earthy cocoa. Smooth flavor that’s got some cocoa and licorice and anise and dark malty roasty slickness. Kinda weird and all over but full, slick, and a little boozy.
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;Aroma is caramel, chocolate, dried berries and ash. Taste is medium sweet and medium bitter. Medium body, sticky feel with average carbonation.
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;2/17/19 - Tallahassee, Fl - Market Square Liquors - 12 oz bottle. Purple-black pour, thin bubbly bone colored head. Dates and rum raisin aroma. Rib-sticking flavor brown sugar, plum fruitinees, dates, canned baked brown bread. Chewy, thick rich mouthfeel.
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;"No surprise Duck-Rabbit nails the Baltic porter so well; these guys know dark beer, and their spot-on version of a difficult style only furthers this assertion. Deep veins of chocolate and dark fruit are layered on top mild notes of anise and bitter coffee. Never grows roasty, though, staying firmly entrenched in the classic porter unsweetened cocoa profile. Not a trace of the 9% ABV, and the fade leaves lingering traces of pumpernickel bread and pitch-black chocolate. Very nice."
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;Bottle. Deep brown-black. Mostly opaque. Aroma is of alcohol, sweet malt and some darker malt. Pretty good - strong, malty with darker malt flavor. Only downside is it's a bit too sweet. Almost like an ale version of a darker doppelbock.
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;"12 ounce bottle into snifter; not sure on bottle dating, but has the 12 notched out on the label. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, nuttiness, and toasted dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of licorice, raisin, plum, prune, fig, date, cherry, sherry, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, nuttiness, and toasted dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of licorice, raisin, plum, prune, fig, date, cherry, sherry, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Very minimal herbal/roast bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, nuttiness, toasted dark/brown bread, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a nice roast/hop bitter/sweet balance; and zero cloying/acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Minimal dryness. Light carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/bready/grainy, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 9%. Overall this is an awesome Baltic porter! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the ABV, with minimally bitter/drying finish. Very rich malt complexity, and complementing restrained dark fruity yeast notes. A very enjoyable and spot on style example. Not sure of the age, but likely has a couple years on it. Very impressive."
The Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter;Farmville, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;The Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery;The aroma is licorice and figs/dates, smells delicious! Pours a dark brown almost black with amber hues, light tan head fully diminishing. The taste is medium sweet/sour. The body is medium/full, the texture creamy, the carbonation lively and the finish long. Sorry but I don't like the flavor/taste of this. For me it is nauseous, a little sickly sweet and not to my liking at all.

St. John Brewers Virgin Islands Tropical Mango Pale Ale;Cruz Bay, St. John, United States Virgin Islands;Pale Ale - Flavored;St. John Brewers - The Tap Room;Pours orange amber with thin head. Aroma is (surprise!) mango and slight caramel. Taste is sweet mango with an ever so slight hop backbone building. Finish is slight hoppiness. Would be a decent beer on a hot, summer day.

Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Sample at beer junction. My first impression is why is there mint in this. As it’s starts to warm there is more cola flavor that makes and appearance. Not bad, could use a little work.
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Black pour with a thin beige head .... Aroma of dark fruity yeast, caramel malts, dry oak and light bourbon .... taste is of caramel malts, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, dry oak, molasses and roasted malts ..... Finish is dry sweet and oaky with candi sugar, molasses .... Solid and tasty
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Growler from SJ. Nice notes of Wood, bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate and hop. Nice roasted finish, good booze flavor, not bad.
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Draft. Exceedingly dark brown, small bright tan head. Jack Daniels completely overwhelms both the aroma and the taste.
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Snifter on tap at the Brass Tap. Near-black color, with a good thin khaki head. Leaves nice, thicker lace. Medium to bigger body. Velvety smooth, lighter carbonation. Lightly slick texture. Very nice, noticeable amount of bourbon barrel, big vanilla, and lightly woody, spicy whiskey flavors work great with the chocolate, light coffee flavors of the porter. Moderate bitter, moderate sweet taste, and just a mild hint of bourbon-type alcohol warmth that is actually pretty pleasant in this application. Fantastic barrel-aged porter, very satisfying. Supremely enjoyable, well-done stuff. Strikes a near-perfect balance. I’m ok with paying $6.50 for the 10oz glass.
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);On tap at The Local in San Diego. Dark brown pour with ruby on the edges and a small khaki head. Aroma is some light roast, heavy sherry and rum booze (does not smell like bourbon here). Flavor is a rather disgusting combination of roast and straight up cheap whiskey (oh, hey Black Velvet) and is barely drinkable. Way light bodied, way to thin for the bourbon barrel aging. I could not finish a 3 ounce taster of this one. It was really bad.
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);On nitro at Old Grove. Pours a pitch black with a thick tan Head with exellcent lacing. Aroma is of bourbon, roasted malts, coco, and a little booze. Taste is similar to the aroma but also has some coffee and grassy hop notes. Has a medium body with a slighty watery mouthfeel and a slighty bitter, medium finish. Overall, a pretty nice BA porter.
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Tap at Churchill’s for SDBW. Pours a deeper brown, cola highlights. Low foam. Mild bourbon nose, small sugar, no tomato past, small vanilla. Taste is thinner than expected, watery, low abv can’t handle the barrel aging. Didn’t come out as intended.
Ballast Point Black Marlin Porter - Bourbon Barrel;San Diego, California, United States;Porter;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Cola, oak, and chocolate aromas. Bourbon kicks in on the first sip. Good body. Slightly sweet with dark fruits and licorice in the finish.

Pours dark brown with a medium foamy tan head that diminishes gradually. Partial rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla and malt. Medium-bodied with flavors of roasted malt, oaky bourbon and vanilla. The finish is mildly boozy with a roasty malt aftertaste. Pretty good all around.
John Harvards Manchester Curacao-Weizen;Manchester, Connecticut, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Manchester;I don’t know if the information I entered is correct, but it’s my best guess. Poured a hazy copper-brown (although the light was low, and it was hard to tell), and tasted of wheat and malt with some light spice, not as much as other dunkels (if that’s even what this is). Enjoyable, but the flavor in the finish wasn’t as great as others I’ve tried (still not bad).
Cedar WTF;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Wheat Ale;Cedar Brewing Company;"Draught at 2nd Annual Festival of Iowa Beers. Use your imagination as far as what ""WTF"" stands for. The brewer described it as an unfiltered American wheat dry hopped with amarillo gold hops. The beer was a hazy yellow-brown color without any head. Smelled of flowery hops and pear. Interesting flavor with cereal grian, white bread, caramel, and fruity hop notes. Finished with some hop bitterness. Not bad."
Millstream Doppel Ganger;Amana, Iowa, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Millstream Brewing Company;From the Festival of Iowa Beers, rich buttery brew with bright copper color, flavor was butterscotch (but in a good way), sweet and malty, very rich.
Millstream Doppel Ganger;Amana, Iowa, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Millstream Brewing Company;Draught at 2nd Annual Festival of Iowa Beers. Special brew described by one of the brewers as an ugly uncle of the 20th anniversary Dopplebock. It had a clear copper color with a thin white head that left some lace. Smelled of buttery caramel. Sweet on the tongue with a complex mixture of alcohol, caramel, molasses, and candy apple flavors. One of the better beers I tried at the festival.
Olde Main Scooter Lemon Ale;Ames, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Olde Main Brewing Co.;Too little like either a beer or a lemonade to have the thrist-quenching properties of either. The lemon component was weakly sweet and the beer component was pale malt without the slightest bit of hoppiness. I think they were going for a radler-type drink, but it’s just not very good. Sticky, sweet, and weak flavors.
Olde Main Scooter Lemon Ale;Ames, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Olde Main Brewing Co.;Draught at 2nd Annual Festival of Iowa Beers. Hazy whitish-yellow color with bubbly white head. Light citrusy aroma. Flavor was distinctly lemon, and was a bit cloying in my mind. The cereal grain malt flavor was really repressed by the fruit flavor. Tasted more like a carbonated hard lemonade more than a beer. A thirst quencher for sure, but not exactly my bag.
Court Avenue Sophies Mild;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Mild Ale;Court Avenue Brewing Company;on tap-pours copper with a light tan head that laces. Aroma is medium malt-bready. Taste is medium malt-bready, some earthy hop. 3.8

Decent, sweet and fruity.

Court Avenue Sophies Mild;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Mild Ale;Court Avenue Brewing Company;Pours a pretty ruby color with a small head. The aroma is roasty with some coffee, some plum, and some mild hops.

Court Avenue Sophies Mild;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Mild Ale;Court Avenue Brewing Company;TAP: rich copper pour, no nose. Sweet, malty, mild coffee/chocolate, some bread on taste. Easy drinker, pretty good.

Smells of light malty caramel. Spicy on the tongue with biscuit and caramel malt flavors and a bitter finish.
Liberty High Point Vienna;High Point, North Carolina, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Liberty Brewery & Grill - High Point;"hints of oak aromatics and even a hint of almond. Color is off, much too clear for the style. Has little flavor to it. The aftertaste is none-existant. This beer needs to be beefed up with more grain complexity. Lacks a significant mouthful; The increase in grain complexity should also correct this as well. Taste does not live up to what the aroma promises. There is very little flavor to this beer but can be corrected by utilizing a more complex grain profile. The beer seems to not need alterations in any other aspects."
Liberty High Point Vienna;High Point, North Carolina, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Liberty Brewery & Grill - High Point;Nice Vienna. Clear, pours amber, tan head, a little light on mouthfeel but well hopped. Sampled at Taste of Triad 2006 and again on tap at restaurant.
John Harvards Springfield Simcoe IPA;Springfield, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Springfield;On tap at the Springfield, PA location. Poured a deep and cloudy orange (almost a copper) color with a small sized off white head. Aromas or oranges and all around citric. Tastes of oranges, light caramel and a very light grapefruit finish. I too would not believe the 80+ IBUs - I found this one to have a very light bitterness with a medium sweetness to it. Light lacing left on the glass.

Pours a ruby red amber with a medium off whie creamy head that left light lacing. Aroma of orange and various other citrus. A little light for what I was expecting from this beers aroma...expecting more from the Simcoe. Flavor of pine, orange, grapefruit and some malt balance. Very light bitterness for the 80+ IBU’s they said this one had.
Grand Rapids Best Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;silphium hit this one on the dot...the sample was hard enough to choke down...brown body with large beige head.....aroma of light roasted malt and nuts...flavor is a watered down version of the aroma, and is barely cognizable...thin palate...simply awful
Grand Rapids Best Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;On tap at GRBC. Dick Cheney himself would blush at this beer’s lack of character and integrity. Translucent orange-brown body, thin buff head. Light nutty, toasty aroma. Bland, lifeless body with toast and light biscuit, and maybe a smidgen of chocolate. Strange watery, grainy finish. No palate development whatsoever. Served in a tulip glass, perhaps to give the impression this beer merits introspection. It’s quaffable, I must admit. It’s water.
Clarks Ale House Armoury Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Middle Ages Brewing;Cask hand pull at Clark’s, Amber with white head. Nose is indistinct, some malt and grassy hops. Taste was abit on the weak side, almost like water, but had citrus and malt taste. this was not a terrible brew but, for its type iv had better
Clarks Ale House Armoury Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Middle Ages Brewing;In short: As good as a cask English Bitter can be. How: Tap at Clark’s Ale House, Syracuse NY The look: Clear golden body with a medium off-white head In long: Although classified as an IPA here this is to me an English Bitter. Smooth as smooth can be. Little airy bubbles in a soft caramelized body. Light orange flavour. Hopping has a dry tree leaves character. Rivals with the best English Bitters on cask I had on cask in England. I couldn’t believe how quickly I drank my pint. Noting fancy, nothing innovative but man that pint was good. The best way I found to get a taste of England without having to deal with the England food.
Clarks Ale House Armoury Ale;Syracuse, New York, United States;IPA;Middle Ages Brewing;Cask hand pull at Clark’s, Syracuse. Amber with one-finger white head that lasts, big bubbles. Nice appearance.

Brooklyn Summer Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Can of beer costing 79p from Home Bargains. Very tasty can of knockout juice that goes down an absolute treat. Smile at least, you can't say no to the beauty and the beast.
Brooklyn Summer Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma and flavor have pale and grainy malts, bready, light citrus and floral notes, soft summer beer.

Brooklyn Summer Ale;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brooklyn Brewery (Kirin Holdings);Pint cuckfield. 5% on the label. Refreshing certainly but a bit iron-y, especially aroma wise. As expected, not great.
Bull & Bush 35th Anniversary Witbier;Denver, Colorado, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bull & Bush Brewery;Draught at the brewery. Head is mostly lasting. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie), with notes of insecticide, cleaning products, diacetyl. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, unclean. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Truly horrific. This was the only thing that reeked of all the beers I tried here, and a second sample of the same beer had the same bug spray smell, so it was obviously not the glass either. Undrinkable.
Bull & Bush Rye of the Tiger;Denver, Colorado, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Bull & Bush Brewery;Draught at the brewery. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is dark amber. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, caramel), lightly hoppy (flowers), with notes of diacetyl and bubble gum. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation. Malty nose ruined slightly by some butter and Bubble Yum, and just too sweet to drink much of.

Magic Hat Mad Pale;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);An experiment by Magic Hat, served up at Clark’s Ale House real ale fest. Good hoppy aroma and light citrus taste, even sour in aftertaste, though suggesting something off that day. Dark yellow tinge with some head and bubbles. Lighter in body though certainly bitterness is there.
Earle Estates Creamy Apricot;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Pours an apricot color with no head. Smell is full of honey and dried apricots with some floral notes. Taste has a very slight bitterness from the fruit, but is smooth and full of honey. Not an elite mead, by any means, but solid and drinkable.
Earle Estates Creamy Apricot;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Tasting at mcbackus 10/19. Pale gold/yellow color. Apricots and sweet wildflowers come through on the nose. Flavor has a great balance of apricots and honey. A good combo of apricot and honey. This one is really delicious.
Earle Estates Creamy Apricot;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;750 ml bottle. Pours a clear pale gold with no head. Strong aroma of apricots. The honey mead is also present in the nose, but to a lesser extent. The apricot flavor is much more subtle in the flavor than the aroma.

Earle Estates Strawberry Shadows;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;750 ml bottle. Pours a clear, pale gold tinted pink with no head. Strong aroma of strawberries and honey. Flavor is also starwberries and honey, but not as strong as the aroma would suggest. Sweet finish, maybe a bit cloying. A good pairing with a sharp cheddar cheese.
Earle Estates Autumn Harvest;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Flowery and pleasant. It was like Easter in my mouth. The smell and taste are both winners in my book.
Earle Estates Autumn Harvest;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;750 ml bottle. This is my least favorite mead that I have tasted thus far from Earle Estates. Pours a clear pink with no head. The aroma of pear, raspberry and honey seem to be fighting each other for dominance instead of combining harmoniously. Same is true for the flavor. The sweetness of the pears and honey seem to fighting against the tartness of the raspberries. This is a case where the sum of the parts does not equal 100%.
Earle Estates Apple Cyser;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;750 ml bottle. Pours a very pale gold with no head. Pleasant aroma of apples and honey. Flavor is also apples and honey. Apples and honey are a natural pairing and while I liked this interpretation, I was still expecting a little more, along the lines of their pear mead which I think is outstanding.
Earle Estates Black Jewel;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;750ml - Pours a magnificent deep red, with plently of berry aroma. Incredibly pleasant first sip, like a slice of berry pie without the sweetness. The honey comes on at the end. Lovely, Earle Estates’ best.
Earle Estates Black Jewel;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;Very soft and very delightful. Great on the palate, it got better with every taste and breath. The best of their meads.
Earle Estates Black Jewel;Penn Yan, New York, United States;Mead;Earle Estates Meadery;750 ml bottle. Pours a deep purply red with no head. Aroma is of raspberries and honey, as is the flavor. I find this mead a bit more cloying, which I think is a result of the 8% residual sugar content.
George Wright Brewer's Revenge;St Helens, Merseyside, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;George Wright Brewing;Cask, Hoylake Lights. Served ridiculously cold, in a ’chill out’ glass....Why oh why ? If I want to ’chill out’ I’ll seek my pleasures elsewhere. Why the brewers revenge ?! Intriguing, perhaps some unspeakably vile ingredient has been injected. Perhaps some bodily fluid ? It certainly tasted like it, from what I could glean. Hazy amber with a lingering white head. Some fruit in the aroma. Initially not bad, with some balanced enough malt and hops, but a really nasty aftertaste, damp wood ?verging on stale, maybe I just had a bad one, but I couldn’t finish. Revenge taken.

Rock Bottom Denver Deep Drought Dry Stout;Denver, Colorado, United States;Stout - Dry;Rock Bottom Denver;"Draught at the downtown Denver brewpub. Head is mostly lasting. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, toasted bread, caramel, coffee). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. A real shame they didn’t get the bitterness right; this is too sweet for a dry stout but otherwise this was a seriously nice beer. And yes, it’s called ""Drought"", as in a long period with no rain...an apropos name for a dry stout indeed, but surprisingly the only beer with this name in RateBeer’s entire database (as of Sep 4, 2006)."

Whim Snow White;Buxton, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Whim Ales;"Cask at the King Billy, Nottingham. This has a pleasing aroma redolent of pineapple. The flavour, however, isn’t as enjoyable; it seems to combine the sweetness of bubblegum with pine needles. The effect is rather cloying. I had a half; a full pint would have been difficult to finish. I’m giving it extra marks for effort."

Faust Weizen Hefe-Dunkel;Miltenberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Brauhaus Faust zu Miltenberg;Bottle from Sprout’s: Poured a dark muddy pond water color but was topped delicately with a large frothy foam cap head. Big bold aroma of Traditional German yeast scents that suggest bubblegum balls, clove, and light banana esters. Some olfaction of wheat but minor. The flavor is little off and comes across as bland and tasting like a sweetened carbonated beverage that has gone flat yet there is carbonation still left in the beer. Lips get a salty finish followed by a slight after note of cheap gumball machine gum. Nothing special but will be keeping the bottle and storing some of my cooking oils inside of.

Pump House Orange Lane Wheat;Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada;Wheat Ale;Pump House Brewery;[022-20060829] Tap @ Orange Lane (Moncton, NB). Smells like banana bread. Cloudy, amber body with a frothy, creamy head. Tastes like drunk bananas, very boozy and gravelly and grainy. Fully, prickily body. Reminds me of a souped up Rickard’s Red, sadly.

New Albanian Mt. Lee California Common;New Albany, Indiana, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft. Summer 2012.

New Albanian Mt. Lee California Common;New Albany, Indiana, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;"taken from notes: I enjoyed this on tap at the brewpub in New Albany, IN. Served cold in a tulip pint. A - A deep copper burnished caramal w/ an inch of light cream that drops quickly. Has a fine bead. There is moderate stickage. The contrast between the red/amber and light tan head is striking as the rings of lace cling tenaciously. S - Nice mellow simcoe and cascade citrus w/ subtle floral notes and tangerine/clementine-like juicy sweet aromas. M - Very mild bitterness seamless malt and hop unity, the sweetness seems to be submerged at first but actually works in tandem w/ the slightly bitter and tart notes of the fresh hop notes riding the fruity and effervescent feel. T - Very much like a pale ale w/ the accent ofn the flavor of the simcoe and the cascade along for the ride. I am very impressed w/ the 1st beer I have had at a brewpub in Indiana. Nice malt anchoring(no pun intended) the sweetness is restrained, but has a nice dry and lightly grainy mild roasteed flavor w/ subtle rye notes -kind of bready as it warms w/ a subtle astringency and the hop flavors remain all the way true to the end. D - Described as a ""session beer"" on the menu, I can’t exactly agree, but 5.6% is close enough. Very Drinkable, I could return to this without hesitation. For me this has a swiss army type of universal flavor. The malt smoothness and plenty of hop sweetness and citrus flavor. This ale is well crafted and hard to find fault with the quality."
New Albanian Mt. Lee California Common;New Albany, Indiana, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;Served on tap at the brewpub. The appearance is a lighter amber with a white head. The nose is light caramel, and kisses of hops. The flavors are similar with the hops underwhelming a bit.. The mouth is medium carbed and bodied. Would like a touch more hops but a nice session-able beer.
New Albanian Mt. Lee California Common;New Albany, Indiana, United States;California Common / Steam Beer;New Albanian Brewing Company;On tap at the brepub. Meh, this one was a bit off balance. I am not too familiar with this style, but I would choose plenty of other offered beers over this one, as this NABC location has one of the best bottle lists in the world!

Black Boss Porter 7.0%;Witnica, Poland;Porter - Baltic;Browar Witnica;"Serving date: 2009-01-28. Served in snifter. 500 ml bottle with freshness date on label (Best before 2009-09-26). Recommended cellaring temperature on label. The pour seems black at first, but soon reveals a very dark-brown color with deep ruby hues. The liquid is very clear. 1 cm cappuccino colored head that dissipates rather quickly. Very very small lacings are left behind. In the nose, there’s cream and coffee with a slightly burnt character. However, most noticeable - and a bit surprising - is a prominent smell of toffee. The taste is also of coffee and a general roasted flavor, burnt caramel, and notes of bitter chocolate in the middle. In the slightly bitter finish there are more coffee flavors and nuances of toast. The hop character is minimal, and I think I would have liked it to be a bit bigger. The mouthfeel is rather smooth and ""calm"", with a medium body and mild carbonation. Basically no taste of alcohol. This is a very good porter, but I must say that I was expecting a little more from it. It could have been a little bolder and have slightly richer flavors. With the well hidden alcohol it almost appears as a very good session porter. But the high ABV would make such a session rather short. Recommended for porter enthusiasts, and I must say that I could definitely see myself buy this one again. I would really have liked to try it at 9,4%, since I think higher ABV would have served it well. Serving type: bottle (Copy of old Beer Advocate review)"

Chestnut – walnut colored. Very clear with a light thin head. Very sweet and malty aroma. Sticky, nutty, sweet. The flavor was not what I was expecting as the guy serving this at the booth did not know what type of lager it was (in fact, no one at that festival was ever able to explain what type of lager anything was…at any booth..irritating). As such I was surprised by the sweetness. In fact, I found the sweetness overpowering and cloying. There is some toasted malt that tries to balance it, but with no success. If there are hops in here they are negligible and add little if anything to the flavor. Mostly a candy sweetness that is overpowering. A sticky, creamy body.

Salopian Abbey Gates;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Salopian Brewery;First tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in October 2007. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale gold amber in colour with a thin white head. Strong dusty hop aroma, floral notes long in the nose. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a thin fruity note of clemantines, this initial sweetness fades fast though. Strong infusion of dry hop pellets gives a very dry bitter aftertaste which sucks the moisture from the palate. Finish is very astringent with strong hop resins still giving tart citric notes in the mouth. Dry and cloying at the end. A very dry bitter and maybe too astringent for some.

Leroy Bruin;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;33 cl bottle at Kulminator, Antwerp. One of the few low-alcohol beers they serve. This one is very much like the Leroy Bock, but sweeter.

Bit caramel and earhty brown malts. Very sweet ( stuff that reminds of aspartaan or stevia or something) . Very lasting sweetness, but unfortunately, not the good kind...
Leroy Bruin;Boezinge, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Leroy;Leroy’s dark table beer and like most of the beers under this brand, delightfully but hopelessly old-fashioned. Yellowish white, moussy head, clear bronze colour. Light nutty and chocolatey, but primarily caramelly malts in the nose, some artificial sweetness as indicated, reminiscent of blonde sugar of even a hint of cocoa powder, the obvious thin mouthfeel, grassy hop bitterishness in the finish. This brewery seems to specialize in obsolete beer styles and they do a damn good job at it: though very stereotypical, this is one of the most well-balanced brown table beers I tasted so far, only surpassed by some of the blonde or ’triple’ ones from Gigi and Slaghmuylder.

Legend British Mild;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Mild Ale;Legend Brewing Company;This is an outstanding session ale from an outstanding small brewery. The good folks at Legend have done an excellent job of recreating a classic English style with this one. Understatement, balance, and harmony are apt descriptors. Unfortunately, it’s a seasonal offering and (at the moment) a limited release -- from a brewery with limited distribution. A visit to the brewpub on the James River will not be a waste of time, though, rest assured.

Legend British Mild;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Mild Ale;Legend Brewing Company;Draft at pub, glad they decided to throw out a mild! Copper appearance, little head.

Perhaps a tad more carbonation than needed, but enjoyable.
Legend British Mild;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Mild Ale;Legend Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Copper pour with thin white head.

Rock Bottom Milwaukee Heartland Dunkelweizen;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Milwaukee. Semi-hazed and mahogany-caramel-brown in color with a frothy, grayish tan head. Aroma’s rocking: bananas beaucoup with some cocoa and prunes marinating in plum sauce. Hazelnuts and nutella provide aromatic substance as well. Flavor comes in lightly with stinging cloves and steel. Light, tragic lemons. Vanilla and almond butter make a little fuss, followed by fluffy fudge brownie mix. Warms up a bit better, butting down with mild milk chocolate fudge and aluminum canned cream soda. Light-bodied and quite a bit of palate reprehension, sliding into grape jam, whole wheat and chocolate bran in the end.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Sheep Chocolate Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;At the brewpub in Milwaukee. Almost porter like. Smooth and a little sugary. Sweet rather than bitter chocolate. Easy drinking. Serving: Tap
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Sheep Chocolate Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;On tap at Rock Bottom Milwaukee. Poured deep brown with a short, well-retained beige head. The aroma picked up a blend of sweet and slightly darker chocolates joined by lactic character.. some coffee and vanilla too.. cake-like as it warmed. The flavor found mostly moderately-roasted darker chocolates laced with milky sourness.. molasses and coffee bitterness surrounded.. spicy and bitter on the finish over a nice bed of chocolate. Medium-bodied and surprisingly bitter on the palate.. the milky sourness worked.. grainy on the finish, with a lot of residual sugars. Solid drink.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Sheep Chocolate Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;On Tap in Milwaukee- Drank while splitting a huge ass chocolate fudge brownie with vanilla icecream ontop and it was a hell of a combo. Pours a pitch black color, tan head. The aroma is feint chocolate, and astringent roasted. Though by my own admittance I was smoking, the person I was with was smoking, and we were sitting in the smoking section. You get the point. The flavor was good delicious chocolate mixed with a good roast charachter as well as some hops tossed in for good measure. Not bad, though if given the chance I’d take the brownie over the brew.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Sheep Chocolate Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Was listed as Black Sheep Stout, but I ’m fairly certain it’s the same beer. Pours to a dark black body with a lasting brown head. Decent lacing. The flavor is chocolatey and roasty with lots of black patent. Bitter cocoa. Hints of plums hide in the finish. The aroma is lacking. Light black patent. The palate is sweet, medium-full bodied, dry on the tip of the tongue. Seems to be more of an Irish non-nitro stout. I also had their cask version. It seemed to be much smoother in flavor and palate. More milk chocolate aroma.
Rock Bottom Milwaukee Black Sheep Chocolate Stout;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Milwaukee;Milwaukee. Muddy and light midnight brown in color, with opacity that’s shielded by the plastic patio cup, though a dark tan head perseveres. Dark chocolate and black patent nail the nose along with deep roasted espresso and mocha beans. Caramel truffles add their own sense of aromatic vibrancy. Pacific Northwest hops surround the flavor, making up for its lack of palate density, imparting a touch of mango to the chocolate covered espresso bean flavor. Caramel weaves through unsweetened bakers chocolate bricks. Bitterness sidesteps carbonation to amplify the tingly mouthfeel. Medium-bodied format hits the espresso baked brownie substance right on the head, grainily disintegrating in the finish with a hint of coffee flavor additive to a lactic café concoction of some sort or another. Decent.
Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;355ml can. 5.60 for a 12 pack. PAle pour, not as offensive as it could be. Mild and as an ice beer tends to be a stronger version of a light beer.
Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;Wow, i actually enjoyed this ice beer because i was on a boat drinking 4% beers for a week and this at least tasted like alcohol...not really like beer though.
Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;Let’s just say for the price of the beer its worth it.

Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;Pours a clear, deep golden color with a modest white head. Nose is very grainy, sweet apple, light corn note with some finishing alcohol. Flavor is very sweet and reminds me of apple juice. Light grainy middle, light spicy hops kiss toward the end. Pretty one dimensional, sweet. Typical crummy beer feeling - very light with lots of fizz. Overall not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually a drinkable cheap beer for camping/lawn mowing without being that harsh super cheap flavor.

Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;This was pitted head-to-head against Keystone Ice in the Great American Shite Beer Taste-Off. Colorado vs Wisconsin. Ice vs Ice. This poured a darker straw colour than Keystone with the same brief white foamy cap. Aroma of corn syrup and apples. Flavour is sweet bland grain with a harsh slightly chemical aftertaste. This brings to mind an interesting question. Does one desire more flavour in ones beer even if said beer is a can of shit? Hmmmm...
Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;Can, but it says 5.6% abv. Pours a golden color with a decent white head that slowly fades. Taste is of corn, sugar and is really sweet. The sweetness reminds me of fruit beers and malt liquors. Aroma is the same, but alcohol is present. Not as watery as what I was expecting. For the price ($5 a 12 pack) this is a decent beer. Goes down easy and doesn’t taste that bad. A good beer to get drunk on. Also the label is kind of neat.
Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;(Can) Pours a clear yellow body with a small quickly dissipating white head. Aroma of lemon, corn, and some floral. Flavor of cardboard, grain, metallic, and stale water.
Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;can from lumpy(and yes i will add a trade to your profile soon) all i can think to say is, fuck you lump. i could end the rating there, but i won’t. pale yellow, active loud white head that did not last. smelled of honeysuckle that grew by the rows of corn out where i grew up, well if there was also an overturned garbage truck nearby that is. oh and metal. taste: well, lets go back to this line: fuck you lumpy. overly sweet corn juice, tastes like all the other crappy pale lagers but with extra creamed corn. my taste buds are pissed, they thought the days of swilling were over except for the occasional camo black ice, because damnit, it is a usefull beer. this was a bad beer, i hope lumpy enjoys the malt liquor i sent him half as much. 2 3 2 1 5
Lost Lake Ice;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Universal Sales Inc;Can. Looks like a macro-gold with a foamy white head. Nose-smells like a macro-very corny, straw, pungent, perfumey, sweet, not good. Taste-tastes like a very fruity overly sweet macro, berry, apple, corny, WAY too sweet, foul, a lot worse than I thought it was going to be. An overly sweet macro mess. Just foul. Burns going down, which is a bad way to finish a bad beer. Bitter and sticky mouthfeel. Hands down one of the worst beers I have ever had.
Americas Farmhouse Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Americas Brewpub;My first tasting of the Illinois Craft Brewers Guild 2006 ReplicAles, this year a Saison.Mike rose to the challenge and produced a tasty brew. It pours a bright yellow body, slightly golden, very slightly hazed, with a bubbly white head. It has a warm aroma, yeast, soft malts, recently cut grasses, a peppery spiciness. Light bodied, it has a refreshing blending of said malts & spices with the addition of apples and unripened pears. Finishing on an herbal bitter note, this is one that I hope America’s Brewpub keeps in the rotation. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL
Opa-Opa Steakhouse Ultra;Southampton, Massachusetts, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Opa-Opa Brewing Company;Pours off white with a white head. Smells of light hops but little in the way of malt is present. Taste is very watery with some light hoppiness.
Americas Why Dont We Get Drunk And Brew... Scotch Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;Sampled from tap on 11/10/2006 at Walter Payton’s Roundhouse in Aurora, IL... Let me start by saying that this is a solid Scoth Ale. I really enjoyed it and was quite impressed with it overall. This is the THE beer to try if you ever make it to Walter Payton’s Roundhouse in Aurora, Illinois! Served in a brandy sniffer. Color is a dark amber with an orangy hue. Nice creamy, orange-colored head. Aroma is caramel malt, and a hint of peat and smoke. The flavor has a complex maltiness to it with a very nice peat and smokiness in the finish. The alcohol is nicely tucked beneath the maltiness and is only evident later in the finish. Slightly heavy on the palate, but just about right. Very smooth and full of flavor (although I would have liked just a touch more smoke!). Very balanced and highly recommended!
Americas Why Dont We Get Drunk And Brew... Scotch Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;I love a good Scotch Ale...and there aren’t that many around! This one looks great...dark mahogany pour with thick, rocky head. The aroma is a wonderfull blend of peat, smoke, scotch whiskey, and caramel. My first impression upon tasting is a big smoky peatiness that really makes this non-smoker want to light up a great cigar while I sip this libation. Big sweet caramel malt bottom is the bass line, while the melody is layered on top of that, featuring a harmonious interplay between the smoke, the scotch, and the hints of toffee and hazelenuts. Or perhaps I just enjoyed getting kicked in the nuts by the alcohol...hard to say, really!
Americas Why Dont We Get Drunk And Brew... Scotch Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;Had this on draught at the brewery in Aurora, Illinois. Served in a brandy glass due to the extraordinary high alcohol content. Deep reddish pour with a thin, lacy head, nose of whisky and sweet chocolate. The flavor is malty and smoky, reminiscent of scotch whisky, but only once the alcohol really roars into the finish. I didn’t like this at all.
Americas Why Dont We Get Drunk And Brew... Scotch Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;My first visit to the pub, and this brew amazed me. Serious malt aroma mixed with alcohol emanated from this caramel colored, tan headed brew. It was warming just to smell it. It was like drinking flaming malts, sweet caramel burning on the tongue as smoky alcohol fumes filled my mouth, nose and sinuses. Nice light hopping to balance the sweetness. Sticky warm finish. It reminded me of Orkney Skullsplitter. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL
Zion Canyon Jamaican Lager;Springdale, Utah, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zion Canyon Brewing Company;"Aroma: none; Appearance: clear golden pour with little head; Taste: more funky than expected with some cereal, yeast, and a little spice; Palate: light bodied; Overall: interesting for a lager."
Zion Canyon Jamaican Lager;Springdale, Utah, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Zion Canyon Brewing Company;"From Sept 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! This pours a hazy yellow gold with another fine 2 finger head of foam. The smell is malty with some fruitiness and just a touch of hop bitterness. Nice nose and good for the style. The taste has good caramel maltiness and some light grain, a little fruit, and just a wee bit of citrus hop bitterness just to keep the sweetness in check. Nice taster here and very easy to drink. Light mouthfeel and lightish carbonation, it finishes with a slight bitterness. Good stuff. Btw, the foam does a very good job of sticking around and the lacing is pretty good. Bottom line: Another good brew from Zion. What more can I say? ;^)"
Zion Canyon Hop Valley India Pale Ale;Springdale, Utah, United States;ISA - Session IPA;Zion Canyon Brewing Company;From Sept 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! It's a twist off cap but I had to resort to a bottle opener... This pours a slightly hazy gold colour with a good 1 finger head of foam. The smell has notes of earthy malt and light notes of citrus and some pine. The taste is on the light side but pretty substantial for a 4.0%abv brew. Good hoppinesss with nice tasty grapefruit and piney hops, good earthy and caramel malt flavours that bring some balance. Hmmm. there's more going on here than I figured there would be. In fact, this is lick ass for a brew this low in alcohol. Hell, even if it wasn't this low in alcohol, I'd say this is a damn good drop. Hell of a session brew, me thinks. It's light bodied, the carbonation is light, and it finishes with a nice pleasing bitter bite. Dang, I can't remember when I finished a glass of IPA quicker than this one. Well done!! And..the head retention was quite good as was the lacing. Bottom line: Don't let the abv scare you away from this one as it is packed with flavour. I'm always impressed with how flavourful, despite the cap limits the state is strapped down with, the brews of Utah *can* be if done right. This one is an excellent example.

Zion Canyon Hop Valley India Pale Ale;Springdale, Utah, United States;ISA - Session IPA;Zion Canyon Brewing Company;From bottle. First taste and aroma of grassy bops, not much in the aftertaste. Dors not taste much like an IPA. More a pilsener with some extra hops.
Zion Canyon Hop Valley India Pale Ale;Springdale, Utah, United States;ISA - Session IPA;Zion Canyon Brewing Company;"12oz bottle, thanks to my parents for picking this up for me during a road trip. Shared with the local group. Mostly hazy amber - orange color. Some particles visible floating in the body. Thin white head. Some loose splotches of lace. Medium body, not as light as the ABV would suggest. Smooth, lightly soft carbonation. Nice grassy hop. Some citrusy hop. Nice citrus zest. Impressive, satisfying IPA, despite being so light. Good flavor overall. THey could easily call this a ""session IPA"" outside and UT and get a little more attention.. Would be a satisfying fix in Utah if I wasn’t able to find anything else of normal strength"
Zion Canyon Hop Valley India Pale Ale;Springdale, Utah, United States;ISA - Session IPA;Zion Canyon Brewing Company;"Bottle to snifter (thanks DrSilverworm).

Zion Canyon Hop Valley India Pale Ale;Springdale, Utah, United States;ISA - Session IPA;Zion Canyon Brewing Company;Bottle: &nbsp Amberish, soft cloudiness, super strong carbonation, even stronger head, super large and fizzy, a few clumps of lacing. &nbsp Almost seems infected... well maybe at least. &nbsp Citrus powder like nose, hoppy yet very sweet. &nbsp Spritzy sweet citrus rind with soft hops that arent too bitter. &nbsp Doesn’t seem infected, or if it is then it is in its early stages. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate, oh, and spritzy. &nbsp Hop oil lingers, like a sweet hop oil. &nbsp Not terribly complex. &nbsp Comes across as a homebrew, but one that isn’t too bad. &nbsp Thanks for the freebie Dallas!
Zion Canyon Hop Valley India Pale Ale;Springdale, Utah, United States;ISA - Session IPA;Zion Canyon Brewing Company;I found this bottle at Ruby’s after the Zion area. It went down fast after a hike.

Americas Dunkels Hefe Weiss;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Americas Brewpub;"""You don’t want that wedge,"" said braumeister Mike as he observed me sitting at the bar with my freshly served brew, thus illustrating the gap between brewpub owner and brewpub brewer. Chucking the lemon slice into my ice water, I looked at a caramel colored ale with a thick & creamy off-white head. The aroma was of overly ripe bananas, clove, and a soft blending of wheat & barley malts. Light in the mouth, the old banana dominated the flavor, smoothly blended with a light spiciness. Very refreshing at the end of a warm seaon. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL"
Americas Cacao Arabica;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Stout;Americas Brewpub;Slightly thin, but an attractive pour, a clear dark, dark brown with a slender, bubbly brown head. The aroma is of freshly brewed coffee laced with creamy milk chocolate. Very smooth to drink, the coffee and chocolate blend nicely with lightly roasted barley and a mild nutty bitterness. Good sessionable stout. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL
Americas Three Threads Bourbon Barrel Porter;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Porter;Americas Brewpub;What I enjoy about this barrel aged Porter is that the Bourbon influence never dominates, but blends smoothly into the rich malt flavors. It pours a very dark brown with a slender tan head. The aroma is of rich, sweet malts, lightly roasted, with Bourbon and a dollop of chocolate. All are reflected in the taste. The Bourbon gains some strength in the finish, making the drink seem deceptively stronger than it is. Nice. America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL

Aroma is strong of dark roasted malts, chocolate and much less of coffee/espresso with the smokiness present, but not overpowering.

Substantial mouthfeel.

Sherwood Alaskan Sister Wit;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Sherwood Brewing Company;Tap: Super hazed, pear colored body with barely any head... only outlined by a bone-white, thin collar. Aroma has notes of musty grains, dry wheat, creamy orange & lemon zest, & a touch of biscuits & yeast. Perhaps just a faint hint of coriander/clove?? Taste is fairly cereal grain heavy with some more must, lemon zest, citrus spritz, light orange, pale malt, & a finish filled with wheat & slight metallic notes. Easy drinker, but relatively boring & lifeless. Not bad, but not much going on, either.

Sherwood Houlihans Irish Stout;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Sherwood Brewing Company;Draft - Light roast. Deep brown black with a small beige head. Molasses, roast and a long roast and light bitter finish. Very dry.
Sherwood Houlihans Irish Stout;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Sherwood Brewing Company;MiBGWF 2009: Deep brown nearly opaque with ruby highlights, lasting tan head. The aroma has notes of roasted and charred malts, bakers chocolate, walnut, hint of coffee and plum, and an earthy yeast ester. The taste is rather straight forward sweet and black malts with a fruity layer. Some very light hop and coffee bitterness as well. Finished with a smack of smoky character. The mouth feel is very good for the genre, oily and lush. All told a darn good beer, another solid stout from this brewery.
Sherwood Houlihans Irish Stout;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Sherwood Brewing Company;Draft at brewery. Dark brown to black in color with a dark tan head. Mostly dark chocolate on the nose but I can pick up some roasted malt and smokiness. The chocolate and smokiness are also the dominant flavors with just a faint hint of coffee beans. Definitely full bodied but not excessively heavy, there is a slight creaminess to the mouthfeel. Very enjoyable brew that I regularly order whenever I’m there.
Sherwood Houlihans Irish Stout;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Sherwood Brewing Company;In short: A very solid roasted stout. Nothing new but very solid. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Black body with a beige ring of foam In long: Plenty of roasted malts with a light roasted coffee bean flavour and a some prunes in the finish. Full bodied, Medium carbonation. Big body but just dry enough to make it highly drinkable. What I really liked about this beer is how much it was roasted and dry yet still felt somewhat juicy and creamy. The Irish part of the name is probably inspired by how tempting it is to get drunk on this highly drinkable beer.
Sherwood Houlihans Irish Stout;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Sherwood Brewing Company;Sample@ WBE: Tasty, but not what you would expect from an Irish Stout. Pours a mahogany color, with amber highlights. Has a sweet, chocolate malt aroma with a bit of a smoked character to it. Very interesting, and it makes me want to try more from this brewery.
Sherwood Houlihans Irish Stout;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Sherwood Brewing Company;I am not an Irish stout kind of guy.

Sherwood Houlihans Irish Stout;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Sherwood Brewing Company;Tap at brew pub: Was an oily black with a nice sized tan head that dissipated rather quickly. Aroma was malty, some chocolate, and a coffee scent too. Taste was nicely malty, chocolate, a slight coffee tinge, and some caramel notes throughout. Palate was rather thin, not really watery, but some nice malty bitterness on the back end. Overall, It was a decent Irish Stout, and had some nice flavors and aroma throughout. I will go back to sample the rest of their beers.

Prasser Helles;Tillmitsch (Leibnitz), Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Landhof Prasser;Draught at the brewpub. After two unsuccessful attempts (closed roads and closed pub) I finally managed to get here. Pale golden coloured, small to medium white head that went away slowly, yoghurty grainy nose.

Prasser Helles;Tillmitsch (Leibnitz), Austria;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Landhof Prasser;Draught at the brewpub, the only one they seemed to have at the moment. Poured a golden body with a thick white head that stayed for a while. Lively carbonation, bordering with fizzy. A light nose, grainy and oily, the taste not being far off... grainy and yoghurty, a light herbal hop presence going into the aftertaste. Biting carbonation. An ordinary lager... one could suspect industrial presence, but not even nearly like with Kugel Bräu.

Schwarzer Rabe Rabenbräu;Wien, Austria;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Schwarzer Rabe;getrunken am Krampustag 2017 Der schwarze Rabe ist ein Wiener Wirtshaus im bierigen 16. Bezirk. Die kleine hauseigene Brauanlage wird aber nur selten angeworfen. Das ausgeschenkte Hausbier kommt von der Villacher Brauerei. Es ist bernsteinfarben und hat einen interessanten Geschmack: Ganz am Anfang haut einen fast die Kohlensäure um und dann schlägt die süße Malzigkeit zu, die aber schnell nachlässt. Hinten raus, nach einem kurzen hopfigen Höhepunkt wird es dann sehr wässrig. Ein wahrer Regenbogen an Aromen, die aber nicht ganz ausgewogen sind und auch besser harmonieren könnten. Das eigentlich schöne, rustikale Lokal kriegt außerdem Abzüge, weil es noch immer ein reines Raucherlokal ist, was aber offenbar der Ottakringer Unterschicht und den Senioren geschuldet sind, die die meisten Gäste stellen.

Flavor is light acidic, then quite sweet and finishing harsh bitter and a bit boozy. Body is medium to full with syrupy texture and soft carbonation. Unbalanced, it's ok up to the finish which is too harsh.
Bronckhorster Scrooge;Rha, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bronckhorster Brewing Company;Bottled - LCRBM2 - A muddy brown coloured beer. The aroma is yeasty with brown fruits. The taste is a little too harsh. Candy sugar and yeast notes in disharmony.

Wickwar Severn Bore;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;Cask at ’Spoons, Milton Keynes. Amber brown with a white head. Faint aroma, definitely some hops. Pleasant light fruit and malt taste and slight bitterness. One of those rather ordinary beers that somehow ticks the boxes.

Nice creamy malt aroma with brown sugar, vanilla and very light hops. Lovely nutty flavour with slight coffee and dusty hoppy tobacco. Nice bitter finish with a delicate sweetness and some more nutty notes. Good balance. Decent stuff.
Wickwar Severn Bore;Wickwar, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wickwar Wessex Brewing;The Fountain Inn, Gloucester, 02-09-06. This beer poured a light brown colour, with a small head. Really good easy quaffing ale which would make a good session beer, malty flavoursome and hoppy a very good standard bitter which unfortunatly I never quite gave the the respect it deserved as I had to neck it down a bit sharpish owing to a Rugby fixture kicking off 35 mins from the time I left this pub.
Raccoon River Best of Show;Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Raccoon River Brewing;The body was dark copper with a light and slight khaki colored head. The aroma was smoky tobacco wtih some caramel. The taste was sweet caramel with a touch of smoke. There was also some musty old water, but it was not distracting. The finish was iced tea on this relatively thick beer.
Takao Porter;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Porter;Takao Brewery;"Brought from my motherland Taiwan by a friend. ""Takau"" (meaning ""hitting a dog"") actually is a local Taiwanese slang word for ""Kaohsiung"", a city in Southern Taiwan where this newly founded micro-brewery is based. Coming in a 350ml can, “can-conditioned”. Canned date 31/08/2006, “best enjoyed within 60 days”. Served cool in a jug. Look: very dark mahogany hue, nearly black; the foamy tan beer head comes thick yet fluffy in texture, gradually settling to a thin cap with a huge hissing sound, while the carbonation remains lively throughout the drink. Nose: smoothly sweet dark chocolate-milk mixed very well American flowery hops, a peachy note and bits of roasted walnuts. Medium-bodied, harmonious, not too complex. Alas, the aroma doesn’t hold too long. Taste: thin-textured bitter black malts and slightly sour roasted malts upfront, with a tinge of treacles, chocolate fudge and roast nuts closely behind; the pale malts lend a lighter edge to the roastiness, as do ripe black plums impart a subtly sour fruitiness to balance the moderate malts... dryish+bitter licorice and hops quietly develop towards the medium-length finish. Palate: it feels slightly thin on the palate and the fluffy fizziness is not optimum. Overall this porter is slightly off-balance, with a sour fruity tinge as a balancer like a porter should have, but lacks a sound weight of maltiness to make a delicious porter. But for the first porter brewed in Taiwan, this is not a bad start!"

Growlers Centennial Ale;Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States;Strong Ale - American;Growlers;Draft - Could be a D-IPA just as well. Clear sparkling orange, thick white creamy head. Hopped up nose of earth, pine, and evergreen, with a soft toffeeish undertone. Well bittered flavor up front that becomes a touch boozey half way though. It receives a light sweet nutty maltiness that rounds it out nicely. Medium to full bodied, soft carbonation, dry bitter finish. One of my favorites from brewer Joe K. Locals should get out to try it soon. It goes very quickly...

Arkells Her Majesty The Queens 80th Birthday Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arkell's Brewery;Bottle. Golden beer with a light head. The aroma is fruity, spiced and hopped, and the flavour is dry, toffee and roasted. Overall a disappointing beer.
Arkells Her Majesty The Queens 80th Birthday Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arkell's Brewery;Bottle. Golden with a small white head. Aromas are caramel malts with toast and apricots. Flavours are soft buttery, toasty malts with initially sweet, then bitter lemon. Dry and hoppy on the finish. I can imagine the Queen getting rat-arsed on this.
Arkells Her Majesty The Queens 80th Birthday Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arkell's Brewery;Bottle, at Kookfest, September 2006. Gold colour. Not fizzy to look at but intensely prickly on the tongue. Otherwise, pretty respectable. Hints of bread and toasty malt in the aroma, with noticeable creamy toffee too. More toffee on the palate but the hops are also pretty pronounced, producing a well balanced, smooth and easy drinking beer. Unfortunately, I’m a staunch republican so I have to score this beer 0.5. Only kidding.
Arkells Her Majesty The Queens 80th Birthday Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arkell's Brewery;Bottle @ Kookfest. Pale colour. Unusual nose - slight banana with tangy hop. Grainy malts and sweet caramel. Not too bad but a bit on the sweet side.
Arkells Her Majesty The Queens 80th Birthday Ale;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Arkell's Brewery;Kook’s Farewell Gathering. Malty, cardboardy, dull bitterness. Light coloured. Nothing interesting. Average and drinkable. Not a lot to say.

Brugge Brasserie Sacre Fleur;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brugge Brasserie;This draft brew from the brewery in Indianapolis, IN poured a small sized head of finely sized white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a hazy typically carbonated dark orange colored body and a good lacing. The fruity aroma was malty with orange notes. The crisp semi-thick mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The complex flavor contained notes of malt and fruit. A decent one that I would consider buying again.

Empyrean Belgian Red;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Empyrean Brewing Company;"Gold color; sweet malt aroma.

Recipe from head brewer Rich Chapin. 19 IBU...don’t know ABV but not like a strong Belgian ale."
Rock Bottom Yorktown Oatmeal Stout;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On tap at the brewpub bar as a full sampler, showing a black/brown hue with a hint of ruby highlighting at the base, an abundant layer of thick, cakey, brownish tan head foam with some decent persistence, and clingy spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was roasted, with a slightly burnt, smoke & wood scent, cocoa, and coffee on the back end. A little better than medium bodied, assisted by the subtle creaminess to the mouthfeel more than the moderate carbonation, the taste was similar notes, with the addition of some roasted, earthy, and slightly tannic bitterness, and a touch of mellowing, toffee sweetness. A tasty Stout, with all the necessary components. Recent batch brewed by Iain during Jim’s sabbatical. A roasted, iced coffee nose, a touch burnt, with just a hint of molasses. Medium bodied, with a lingering roasted & earthy astringency that was quite dry and favorably parched. Not much sweetness to speak of, and I liked it that way.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Oatmeal Stout;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Not much aroma. Cascades when pulled from the tap. Fully opaque body. Light brown, Guinness-style head. Nice, yet unnatural, looking lace. Somewhatdry, but definitely more flavor than Guinness. Doughy. Nice. Faint bitterness. Quite good actually.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Oatmeal Stout;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Yorktown;I start out a bit biased because I’ve never been thrilled with nitro’ed beers, but this wasn’t too bad. Looks nice, of course, an extremely dark brown body, clear at the edges, with a creamy tan head. The muted aroma has roasted malt, barley, and coffee with a touch of cocoa. A bit too smooth of a mouthfeel for me. The flavor accurately reflects the nose having just a hint of bitterness in the finish. Okay, but not a thriller for me. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL
Rock Bottom Yorktown Oatmeal Stout;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Yorktown;"Mug Club Draft. Muddy dark brown in color. A nice nitro swirl of tiny bubbles, under a half-inch ecru head. Smell is very light cocoa with hints of mild coffee. Taste has all the texture of a nitro oatmeal stout, not quite velvety, more a velour. Light vanilla and a slight Guinness sourness in the finish. No alcohol burn makes this an easy beer for lunch; I had mine with chili."
Ottweiler Birra Rossa;Homburg, Saarland, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Karlsberg Brauerei;"Never heard of ""Ottweiler"" before this, so perhaps this beer is already on here and I did not know where to look. However, this ""altbier"" is rather tame in every respect. Decent mounthfeel makes this Birra Rossa a bit different from many other ""Birre Rosse"" that make their ways into Italy. Nothing more than a nicely balanced, copper-colored alt. .33L bottle."

Cottage Thames Tunnel;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Pale dirty brown body with very little head. What do they use to brew this? This Thames Tunnel sure looks similar to the Thames River! I’m surprised by the low ratings. Of the countless light same-old cask Bitters I had in London this one was one of my favourite. Delicious toffee/malt flavours well balanced by those mild English hops. Nothing extraordinary, just well put together and something I could drink on a regular basis in large quantity.
Cottage Thames Tunnel;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask takeaway @ Kookfest. Mushroom, toasty cereal, earthy malts cellars and toffee.

Two Brothers Philosophers Stone;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Poured a beautiful dark color that lit up terrifically under light to a deep ruby red. Notes were of yeast and malt. The taste combined the yeast with slight hops and grass.
Two Brothers Philosophers Stone;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;Two Brothers Brewing Company;A black saison that brown interesting. Pours a medium to dark cloudy brown, but far from the hue of a black IPA or imperial stout. An incredibly pungent funky brett aroma with notes of horse blanket, oak and chocolate. Moderate to faint sourness on the palate with dense carbonation

Two Brothers Philosophers Stone;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bomber. Deep brown body with ruby highlights. Fizzy, off-white head. Aroma of char, barnyard, brett, roasted grain. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Light acidity. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Lightly tart finish. Taste of roasted grain and lacquer. Odd flavor — the roast and bitter hops are at odds with the funk.
Two Brothers Philosophers Stone;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;Two Brothers Brewing Company;I rather enjoyed this. Very mild oak and mild sour(brett) flavor. I think the sweetness countered the sour a little and made it less tart. A fuller bodied fuller mouth feel sweeter version of a mildly sour flemish brown. Serving: Bottle
Two Brothers Philosophers Stone;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse - Dark;Two Brothers Brewing Company;22 oz. bottle. Pours brown black copper color with a nice tight soapy white head that dissipates to a wispy film and collar. Aroma has a nice farmhouse scent with some light citrus and malt notes which consist of lemon and fresh baked bread. Taste has subtle funky farmhouse along with a gentle tart brett flavor and bitterness and some plum dark fruit notes along with some roasted malt. Palate has a full and drying finish. Quite nice and unique!
Outer Banks Weizenheimer Hefeweizen;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy yellow color with a thin white head. Pungant sour nose. Very tangy beer with lots of lemon rind and what seemed like lactic acid. Finish has some clove spice. More tangy than I like in a hefeweizen.
Outer Banks Painkiller Pale Ale;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - English;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On tap at the brewpub. Deep golden color with a sticky white head. Fresh hop nose. Lots of orange juice flavors with the finish tending more towards a grapefruit rind bitterness. Okay pale ale, and good with the fish and chips.

Hans Baoji;Xian, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hans Beer Brewery (Tsingtao);Bottle (in Xi’an) Clear pale straw, no head. Initially hoppy vegetable aroma, pilsner-like, but vanishes quickly. Medium body and carbonation. Sugary sweet with some short-lived bitterness in finish. A very strange beer - I would not be surprised to find that it is not brewed, but manufactured - it seems so artificial.
Hans Baoji;Xian, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hans Beer Brewery (Tsingtao);628 ml bottle, probably only available in the Shaanxi province, hence it is named after the city of Baoji. Pours golden, but a bit darker tinged than usual, quickly dissipating white head. Aroma is surprisingly malty. Flavor has quite a bit of malt, for a Chinese beer. These Still some off- adunct flavors and a little cabbage. A little bitterness lingers on the tongue. For a Chinese lager this beer is alright. Note: Chinese beers actually list the amount of pure malt on the label and this one says 10 (degrees) which is most I have seen on any Chinese beer - the same as Qingdao.
Hans Baoji;Xian, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hans Beer Brewery (Tsingtao);(Bottle) Pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma of light citrus and skunky metallic. Falvor of metallic and grain with a watery mouthfeel.

The flavour is mildly cherryish, unfortunately also with a distinctly metallic aftertaste, almost bloody. Hint of berry bitterness and sourness to balance the fruit. Not too sweet, just right for me. Not sour either. Good mouthfeel, almost creamy carbonation. Would have been an OK beer without the metal notes. Must be drunk quickly, then the aftertaste is not too bad.
De Wijkgaard Betuws Kriek;Meteren, Netherlands;Flavored - Fruit;De Wijkgaard;Bottle. Orange red color, big creamy head. Cherry juice and chewing gum in the aroma. The flavor is like cherry wine, the beer is relatively dry. I expected much sweeter, but there is only a light fruity sweetness. Short aftertaste.

De Wijkgaard Betuws Witte;Meteren, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Wijkgaard;Bottle shared at LCRBM09. Sweet, flowery nose, fragrant and pleasant. An odd plastic note that can be ignored (at first). Taste is less pleasant: lightly sweet, rolling into a one-dimensional, sticky, disproportionate bitterness. Lightly bitter aftertaste with more of that floral perfume. Odd. Not quite all there.
De Wijkgaard Betuws Witte;Meteren, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Wijkgaard;[9/5/09] Bottle sample during LCRBM at Kulminator in Antwerp. Cloudy yellow. Aroma of fresh fruits, some wheat, citrus and some spiciness. Sweetish flavor with some acidity and some slightly unpleasant spicy bitterness with fruits and candies. Light-bodied.

Founders Workingman's IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap: as BNB and Silphium noted, fairly typical of Founders. However, that is not to say that this is a bad brew. I found it to be very hoppy (PNW varieties), and in a good way.
Founders Workingman's IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Draft at brewpub. Poured clear dark amber with a fizzy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate sweet malty and sour citrus aroma. Medium body with a slick texture. Medium bitter flavor with a medium smooth bitter finish of moderate duration. Solid drinkable beer.
Founders Workingman's IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);dark amber/brown body with small off-white head...aroma is typical of a Founders hop-infused beverage...as Silphium notes, it begins very piney and finishes with a sugary malt complex...flavor is of Amarillo hops...very similar to all of their IPA variations. Very tasty, and well done.
Founders Workingman's IPA;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;IPA;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. Murky orange-brown body, thin/medium buff head. Piney hops aroma with caramel and sweet breads. In the vein of their Double IPA and Devil Dancer, this is a dense, rather complex IPA with a strong emphasis on Amarillo hops at the beginning of the palate, leading to a firm, less distinct bitterness backed by ample bready, toasty, caramely malts. Incredibly smooth for an IPA of this ABV and bitterness. Probably a one-off of the Devil Dancer.
Stadin An Lochlannach;Helsinki, Finland;Red Ale - Irish;Stadin Panimo;Draught@Punavuoren Ahven. Amber color, small firm off-white creamy head. Clove hoppy aroma with notes of sweet maltyness. A bit watery, but creamy mouthfeel - like in Kilkenny. Light toasty and hoppy finish and aftertaste. Very Irish ale like and tastier than the most of its Irish exemplars.
Stadin An Lochlannach;Helsinki, Finland;Red Ale - Irish;Stadin Panimo;Dark coppery color, little yellow head. Mildly caramelly, slightly hopped and dry aroma, fruits come up also.

AleSmith Double Red IPA;San Diego, California, United States;IPA - Red;AleSmith Brewing Company;On tap at CBC, Clerkenwell on 18th October 2019. Russet copper with pale tan scantly lacing foam, shallow in depth. Spicy cherries and plums in an invitingly smooth fruity aroma. Rich and intense cherry, ginger, spice and soft fruits in-mouth, with a hot peppery note. Spicy, fruity finish. Velvet smooth on a full body. Absolutely superb.
Pedneault Le Vieux Verger;Saint-Bernard-sur-Mer, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie et Vergers Pedneault;pours clear extra pale yellow and showing its legs. slightly floral and dry fruits, white grapes, bone dry white wine, minerals, faint apples and pears, hint of spices, woodsy and nutty notes. flat carbonation, medium body - oily, dry lightly floral and mineral finish. interesting offering but using old varietals of apples doesn’t add complexity and depth necessarily.
Pedneault Le Blanchon;Saint-Bernard-sur-Mer, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie et Vergers Pedneault;2018-12-27. Crisp yellow body, headless. Aroma of apple, lightly dry. Flavour is similarly apple forward, with touches of stems and skins tannins around the edges. Average bodied palate, uncarbonated. 7/3/7/3/14 Small sample at the cidery, Quebec City.

Pedneault Le Blanchon;Saint-Bernard-sur-Mer, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie et Vergers Pedneault;Originally rated December 2006. Purchased on the island where it is made. Pours a bright golden clean colour with no usual bubbly small head. No carbonation is found either. Weird, says carbonated sparkling light cider on the bottle. The nose is nice though, with the apples sticking out. Quite a dry mouthfeel. The taste is not really punchy, so lacking in taste. Mild apples and the dryness stops quickly after the finish, so the aftertaste comes back to a watery feel. So, great smell, but overall missing the boat.

Pedneault Pommes Gelées;Saint-Bernard-sur-Mer, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider-Ice/Fire/Fortified;Cidrerie et Vergers Pedneault;2018-12-27. We tried two versions, one aged a year in the bottle. (They don't seem to distinguish the two in the labelling, unless I wasn't paying attention.) The younger version is crisp and yellow, sweet fruity apple. Fairly simple. The older version has more caramel notes and a touch more complexity. Both are smooth and sweet throughout. The paler version has more bits of stems and skins tannins around the edges. 7/3/7/3/15 Small sample at the cidery store, Quebec City.

Takao Hefeweizen;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Takao Brewery;"Brought from my motherland Taiwan by a friend. ""Takau"" actually is a local Taiwanese slang word for ""Kaohsiung"", the 2nd largest city in Southern Taiwan, where this newly founded micro-brewery is based. Coming in a 350ml can, “can-conditioned”. Canned date 31/08/2006, “best enjoyed within 60 days”. Served chilled in a small weizen glass. Look: murky dark yellow-orange honey hue; the white creamy beer head builds up slowly but surely, to 1cm thick then slowly dissipates with patience… gentle streams of fizziness decorated with large bubbles ejecting from the bottom of the glass. Pretty solid. Nose: typically weizen-yeastiness: sweet lemons, green bananas with a touch of green apple peel, combined with a touch of vanilla, clove, while a swirl brings out some apple-ish fruity perfume. The wheatish maltiness is just about enough to render a rough balance, while the dense sugary edge of wheat-malts bears a little resemblance of oxidised honey as well as caramel. Flavour: a light palate is full of doughy wheat-ish and lesser caramely malts, on top of the sour-sweet fruitiness of lemonade, green banana and bubble-gum, while the spicy yeastiness gradually gathers pace and demonstrates a rich flow of ground clove in parallel with a prevalent flow of savoury-sweet, exotic shellfish-ness(like steamed clams!!), and a slightly tangy, dryish-bitter aftertaste like dried lime-peel, light but lingering finish. Palate: fine fizziness on the mouthfeel, medium-bodied, with an initial good balance falling off and not holding well as the carbonation evaporates. Considering it’s a canned weizen, I’m quite surprised by the quality and texture it has shown. Well down, Takau! This is not some easy beer to start one’s business with, mind you. The only downside is the yeastiness does bring me some headache which hasn’t happened to me before with any HEFE-weizen…"
Rock Bottom Yorktown Lumpy Dog Brown;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Sample por at the brewpub. Pours a dark brown with a thin off white head and good lacing. Aroma is molasses and nut and wood. Taste is sweet sugars, molasses and a woody nut. Pretty solid brown ale.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Lumpy Dog Brown;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On tap at the brewpub (Lombard, IL) One of my favorites of the standard fare. Pours a deep dark brown with a small head that doesn’t do to much in the way of sticking around. Aromas are lighter, touches of nutty sweetness, chocolate, and a bit of smokiness. Maybe some coffee. Taste is similar, lighter fare on the side of light-med bodied, surprising, easily drinkable, a little watery. A decent darker brew and for 2 dollars a piece on Tuesdays, I can be a believer. Cheers!
Rock Bottom Yorktown Lumpy Dog Brown;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On tap at the brewpub/restaurant bar. Footed ale glass served. Labeled a brown ale, but on the board as a Scottish, description connotes Scottish style elements, tasted like a Scottish, and is rated as a Scottish. Poured a dark brown with some ruby tint. The head was foamy, diminishing, and offwhite/light tan, with some good lacing. The aroma was lightly sweet with roasted malt. The flavor retained the roasted notes and added some dark fruit with a hint of tangy nature. Not much,if any, hop bitterness. The body was medium to full and very drinkable.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Lumpy Dog Brown;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Draught. In an effort to give the local Rock Bottoms regular line up a shot I tried their Lumpy Dog on draught 02/17/08. It was a solid brown, appearing reddish brown with a creamy light tan head. Aroma was typical malty, a bit cereal grain. A touch nutty, some sweetness from teh malts, not bad, a bit over carbonated in the mouth which was a turnoff.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Lumpy Dog Brown;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On tap at R.B. - Yorktown. Poured a clear, deep reddish-brown with a nice initial cap of off-white head. Toasty caramel and vegetal notes form an odd aroma.. light earthy tones.. not appetizing. Odd blend of dark caramelly sugars in the flavor.. some toasty chocolate notes.. too sweet and it had an ugly finish. A little bit tacky on the palate. Didn’t enjoy this one.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Lumpy Dog Brown;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Brown Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;There are rocky tendencies to a slim, ecru head that leaves moderate lacing above a ruby body. Smoked malt aroma with chocolaty, cocoa notes beneath... all of which carry through to the flavor. A harsh sweetness doesn’t bother me before hefty, roasted malts. A thick body carries full flavors. Screw any allusions to hoppy English ales, we’re approaching robust Porter territory here. On draught at Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL 60148

Poured a dark golden color with a bit of a darkness to it. Nice substantial head that sticks around. Nose of sweetness and hoppy floral and fruit notes as well. Taste is a well balanced APA that was sufficient. Light caramel malts balanced with some decent hops was predictable, but a good predictability for myself. A decent APA that did a good job of keeping me interested in coming back.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Powerhouse Pale Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Yorktown;"Mug Club served at Yorktown. Cloudy, amber/orange color, with an off white, foamy head, and nice, clinging lace that spiraled down the inside of the mug. The aroma was floral, a little resin, sweet fruit, and mid-strength citrus. These notes in addition to a mellow hop bitterness, balance this medium bodied APA nicely. Cask pour 7/25/09: Although the nose was even more fragrant due to dry hopping, the head and lace were impressively thick and long lasting, and the flavor carried the consistent hop bitterness to finish; the body fell off quite a bit to more of a watery state. Consider the rating a push...not a pull. Jim’s latest version is a bit more assertive, with caramel sweetness, grapefruit, and a touch of pineapple tang, livelier carbonation, a more pronounced & lingering, citrus & rind hop bitterness, and a rather crisp finish. +.1"

Mickey Finns Mexican Cerveza;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;don’t bother with this one... super ugly, clear mostly a bit of pee looks like water and that’s what it tastes like, nothing bad about the nose or taste just not worth paying money for water
Mickey Finns Mexican Cerveza;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;On tap at the Mickey Finn Brew Pub. Poured a light and clear yellow color with a small sized white head. Aromas and tastes of watered down something (there was barely and aroma or taste to this one).

Taylor Wild Blueberry Wheat Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;I had this on tap, took a growler home for further study and it fell out of the car and lost most of its head. Still, it was a favorful and plaesing beer, albeit sans carbonation.
Taylor Wild Blueberry Wheat Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Taylor Brewing Company;With apologies, more or less, to Gary Taylor, who has this at the brewpub as one of the three (out of eight or so) beers that’s actually brewed on sight - - I should’ve rated this as a drainpour, totally, but I’m in a good mood (regardless of my needing a new ejector pump for the addition’s washroom) because of good vibes from non-beer related sources. It pours a clear, iced tea brown with a minimalist’s head. No lacing. The smell is of blueberries and a handful of mud. There’s a rusty malt somewhere beneath the heavy blueberry taste. Hard to recognize as a beer. Or as a fruit drink. Nice brewing facilities at the brewpub. I wish Gary would use them more wisely. Even the IPA, which I’d enjoyed in the past, has been dumbed down to the point that the hop bitterness wouldn’t wash the blueberry flavor away. Taylor Brewing Company, Lombard, IL

Shady Grove Sparkling Locust Honey/Apricot Dry Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;"Draught. Pours a greenish tint of yellow with lines of bubbles and a slight white head and falling legs. The aroma is vinous with light honey and faint fruity sweetness, occasional waft of sulfites. The flavor has a dry champagne-y quality to it, but the honey comes out in the finish. The apricot is very mellow; I probably wouldn’t have been able to isolate it had I not known it was there. Good to accompany the sushi with which it was consumed, but not a great mead on its own."

There is just a medium level of honey in the aroma and a light dry, fruitiness. The mouthfeel is very dry and quite light. The honey is subdued for a mead.

Apollo Honning Ale;Copenhagen, Denmark;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bryggeriet Apollo;An unclear orange beer with a thin off-white head. The aroma is sweet and quite perfumated flowery, like a grass meadow in summer time, these notes are combined with some heavy somewhat cloying notes from the yeast. The flavor is very sweet, and the honey combined with the flowery and citrus notes leaves a layer on the tongue. But it also has a note of sour milk, is this a brewing flaw? the flavor really reminds me of youghurt naturel with eucalyptus honey, which I loved to eat when I was a child, but I’m not that fond of it as an adult and in my beer. I happy, that I only ordered 25 cl, since it get very cloying in the end.

Sly Fox Nugget IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Tap at Spuyten Duyvil. Deep orange colour with a massive tight-laced tan head. Nice looking beer. Aroma is very fruity showing red grape, blackberry and raspberry that I just didn’t know this hop had. Rich and sweet smelling with a contribution from both caramelly/toasted malts and the inherent sweetness that this hop seems to have. So fruity that it’s hard to believe there isn’t added blackberry. Caramel and heavy toast overlayed on the rich heady fruitiness and a fairly assertive earthy resinousness. Flavour is chewy and sweet up front but is balanced by the high hop rates. Moderate to strong bitterness on the back. I was expecting nothing and this certainly gave me a lot more than that. A very unique and tasty brew.
Sly Fox Nugget IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draft at the Sly Fox IPA Project 2006. Solid IPA. Had a good sweet bitter bite to it. Not as dry as some of the other IPA’s from here.
Sly Fox Nugget IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draft from SFR. Pours deep coppery with 1-finger off-white head. Aroma is caramel malty and hoppy. This one tasted and finished on the less fruity but more bittery hoppy end of the spectrum. As with all the SF varietals, this one has a solid, firm, hefty caramel malt base that shields and tempers a well hidden alcohol wallop that will knock you on your ass if you aren’t careful. I’ve tried to session the varietal IPAs, and it doesn’t work too well.

Westons Organic Vintage Cider;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Westons Cider;On tap The Wharf. A clear, still cider that smells big time of leather.

This beer pours a clear honey color with a thin off-white head that diminishes steadily. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of honey and brady malt, along with some spice. Medium-bodied with a mouthfeel like a lighter Barley Wine, this is definitely a sipper. Flavors of wheat, dark malt, tart fruit and honey are all present.

Chicago Hawaiian Honey;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Strong Ale - American;Chicago Brewing Company;12-1-07 tap at brewery Smells of honey and sourdough bread, with a background of alcohol. Hard to swallow because the taste of alcohol is not well masked at all. Can actually taste the honey too. Has a honey texture and aftertaste - the name is not lying - this is a HONEY beer! Not big on the honey texture - it seems to sap all the moisture out of the mouth and stays on the tongue for longer than I’d like and the alcohol presence in the taste isn’t great either.

Eve's Bittersweet Farmhouse Cider;Ithaca, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Eve's Cidery;Hard to rate this @ the Farmer’s Market with that hipster fish monger downwind. Lowball glass at home, sweaty bottle. Clear, active, yellow & amber body. Smell is mushy/caramelized red fruit, grass, alcohol, & yeast. Lacking. Taste is better. Damp, macerated apples. Saline. Very mellow alcohol. Not much tartness. Could be juicer. Moderate acidity. Earthy bitterness. Pinch of sourness on the finish. The carbonation is really nice. Strong, but not irritating. Husky dryness. After a few slurps, my tongue feels like I was just eating a bowl of almonds. Tasty cider, but it could use a bolder nose. I’m more concerned though about what kind of sucker pays almost $24lb for swordfish?!

Eve's Bittersweet Farmhouse Cider;Ithaca, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Eve's Cidery;750mL Bottle, poured at CiderDays 2011. Complex, but a bit calus. The bitterness is very forward in this cider and I think that’s something that’s a matter of taste. As a hoppy beer drinker, I notice the bitterness in cider, but rarely comment on it’s intensity. Great structure and complex. A cider for slowing down. Enjoyable.

Eve's Bittersweet Farmhouse Cider;Ithaca, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Eve's Cidery;I want to preface by saying that goldtwins and JoeMcPhee know nothing about good cider (for goodness sake they think everything tastes like dill). Special bottle provided by apoptosis and notalush (yeah I put the woman first, someone thank me for it) [Completely unrelated, I am having deja vu right now]. The cider does pour an ugly color (which is usual for a lot of cider), almost clear water but has a hue of yellow. Aroma is some booze, isopropanol, light apple sweetness, which is spiky. The alcohol however adds to the heft of the beer, which is uncommon in a lot of ciders. Taste is granny smith apples skins’, slight sour apple, grapes, and again heft from alcohol. Again the alcohol ends a heft (and in a way a legitimacy) to the cider which is rare among ciders. P.S. screw Larry and Joe.

Fine carbonation.
Eve's Bittersweet Farmhouse Cider;Ithaca, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Eve's Cidery;I’m not that experience with cider’s in general, so this is mostly an opnion of how I enjoyed drinking it...it has a pale yellow body with a big bubbled, quickly fading head. Highly carbonated. the finish is slightly sweet and wine-like. Strong, natural apple flavor with lots of yeastiness. A good amount of tart sourness. Crispy apples in the aroma, with honey as well. I look forward to trying more of their products in the near future.

Montegioco RatWeizen;Montegioco, Italy;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Birrificio Montegioco;My Bottom Line: Pear juice, white grapes and citrusy angles whirl into an acidic finish in this otherwise phenolic, vinous Weizen. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy head of foam covers the misty white. -The mouthfeel is slender and fluffy. -Once you get used to the higher-than average acidity, this is really quenching. -The nose doesn’t let on to the prevalent pear juices and acidity. Clovey phenols are kings in the aroma. On tap at Bir&Fud.

Aftertaste very dry, with smoked peat notes, grain, oatmeal, a hint of sugars and just an overall malty feel throughout. Overall, a decent dry stout that shows well and has the characteristics of those from the Carribean and certain parts of Africa, which is nice and good to try for those who haven’t had beers from those locales or can’t get dry stouts too often. I sampled this 33 cL bottle purchased from Merchant’s in Dearborn, Michigan on 24-July-2015 for US$3,79 sampled at home in Washington on the first slightly chilly day here for the season, on 11-November-2016."

Dry Dock Coffee-Infused Oatmeal Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at Dry Dock poured an opaque black with a small lasting brown head. Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate and light vanilla. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla with a smooth lingering coffee finish.
Dry Dock Coffee-Infused Oatmeal Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Dry Dock Brewing Company;At first look, this is a typical oatmeal stout. Dark and rich brown hue with a fantastic fluffy light brown head. A closer look yields a thick body, cask conditioned and the aroma…. This oatmeal stout is infused with coffee, light to heavy malt with hints of molasses, milk chocolate and an enticing mild coffee shows through. The yeast gives it a slightly sweet smell too and even a bit of tar and smoke due to the cask conditioning. Tasting brings the enjoyment of beer to a whole new level. Initially a light sweet yet bitter flavor with the expected coffee, but it grows in the mouth with a pleasantly developing taste. Complex flavors of smoke and roasted coffee succumb to an agreeable acidity in a stout. Smooth body with a slightly oily yet creamy texture allows this to be a very drinkable oatmeal stout. Finishes average for this type of beer and with a delightfully soft carbonation and slight acidity to the feel in the back of my throat, I drink another. This is a really great oatmeal stout. With the infused coffee, it makes it that much more interesting and drinkable but the cask conditioning makes this ale amazing and I can’t wait to drink another.
Dry Dock Coffee-Infused Oatmeal Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Dry Dock Brewing Company;The best coffee-infused beer I’ve ever had (on cask at the brewery). The coffee and oatmeal had me looking for the eggs and bacon! Man, this was good. PLEASE make it again! Solid black body, nice head, coffee notes, slight metallic and roasty flavor - yum!

Dry Dock Coffee-Infused Oatmeal Stout;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Cask conditioned – gravity dispensed: Penetrable black. Dense and sticky beige foam. Striking aromas of smoky coffee, potting soil, tar, and chocolate fudge. Fairly ashy and hints at dried plums. Soft carbonation supports a silky and oily body. Dazzling interplay between rich yet acidic java and pungent smoke-accented roast. Delightfully beefy at the center, but a chalky dryness ensues and accentuates the lush chocolate which hugs the palate and bolsters the body. Malts are fairly shallow and unpronounced, but the coffee is seductively silky and gritty with notions of char and compensates with heaps of multilayered decadence. Also fairly estery with notes of ink and juicy plums, but still quite quaffable due to the moderate level of dryness. Lightly metallic zing complements the understated malt sweetness, but doesn’t overwhelm or detract. Finishes immensely tarry and chocolate fudge-laden, yet deceptively light with dry char and subtle but effective notes of billowy smoke. Cheers to Kevin and the gang for not only serving Real Ale that’s finely conditioned, but also without the use of a sparkler. A fun couple of pints this was.

't Pakhuis Feestbier;Antwerpen, Belgium;IPA;Huisbrouwerij 't Pakhuis;Zythos Bierfestival 2012, Leuven, Belgium. It pours clear gold with off white head of foam. The aroma offers up citrus and mango as well as a bit of garlic and asparagus like nuances. Hmm. The taste has garlic and onion bleeding into some citrus and it works pretty well. I also get some spicy hops and a touch of black pepper. All in all a tasty offering.
't Pakhuis Feestbier;Antwerpen, Belgium;IPA;Huisbrouwerij 't Pakhuis;Tap at ZBF’12, Leuven, Belgium: Hazy blond coloured brew with an taste of grapfruit and some aftertaste like an kind of American hoppiness.
Heineken 3.5%;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;I tried it but I’m not a fan of bland beer. They had this in my hotel rooms mini fridge and I needed a beer after a long day of traveling
Heineken 3.5%;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;Blik @ Idre Fjäll, VIII 2018. Naar alle lagers 3,5 procent lager nu ook de Heineken. Eerlijk is eerlijk deze mag dan maar 3,5 procent zijn maar doet slechts weinig onder voor zijn volle broer van 5,2 procent. Moutig, goeie bitter en door drinkbaar. Alleen door de alcohol qua smaak net ff minder sterk. Maar alles wel met typische heldere gele lager kleur en dito witte schuimkraag.
Heineken 3.5%;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;Can from Sara, Gothenburg. Pours a bright slightly golden yellow with a thin white bubbly head that disappears quickly. Aroma is sweet, caramel and sugar with little hop. Taste is thin, watery and sugary. Fizzy thin mouthfeel with a sweet finish. Poor.
Heineken 3.5%;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;Quite pale and smells of grain. A good taste, just a bit too little of it. Not much to cheer about, but an alright beer.
Heineken 3.5%;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;The best that probe the international 3.4 bottle lager with a character of hops very accented. Quite good, the Dutch
Heineken 3.5%;Zoeterwoude, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Nederland;330ml bottle from ICA. Clear pale golden, small white head, weak lacing. Grainy and sweet nose, white bread and metallic notes. Light-bodied, medium carbonated, watery mouthfeel. Mid-sweet taste, grains, white bread and boiled vegetables. Mild grassy bitter finish.
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);500 ml bottle. Amber. No head. Slightly hazy. Rounded oily maltiness. Very delicate. Some caramel. Low carbonation. Soft texture. Little flavours except powdery wheaty flavours. Rather watery finish. Some bready notes.
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);Bottle. Not so clear. Aroma is spicy and flavor is light ginger with some vegetable tones. Not so bitter.
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);Big white foam. Nice flowe spicearoma. Taste of the ginger is there bt not to much. Wery small bitterness. A blend beer.
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);500 ml bottle. From Latvia. Hazy golden colour with fluffy, fast vanishing head. Aroma: spices, vegetables, toffee, grains. Spice, honey sweetness and cardboard in flavour. Quite strange but not bad.
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);500ml Bottle - Golden in colour with a slight haze. Slightly funky aroma with ginger and a bit of honey. Sweetish taste with malt and the ginger being noticeable although not overwhelmingly so. Sometimes it seems like this brewery have got a deal with some local grocer when it comes to ginger and they just have to use it. I am all for creativity but there is no need to use it in virtually every beer that you produce. It gets a bit tedious! The beer is drinkable though, I just feel that these brewers have more potential than they are currently showing.
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);Bottle, 4.5%. Buttery and oxidized aroma. The flavour is oxidized and slightly plasticky. Must be the weird ginger as it is not past BB date.
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);"Small white head. Yellow body, slightly hazy due to particles. Rich malty aroma with fruity honey notes and a touch of toffee. Dryish and sweetish taste of tobacco and light malts with fruity milky notes. No real aftertaste; just fades out quite quickly leaving a watery lightly metallic aftertaste. Nice, in a kind of mellow way, and probably a little bit old. (0.5l bottle from KnutAlbert.)"
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);Hazy golden beer. Malty body, full flavour. Grain, spice, honey. Rather sweet, but som warm spices balance out the sweetness.
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);500ml bottle - thanks to Knut Albert for sharing. Firm white head over an unclear, beige head. Unusual aroma and taste. The aroma can best be described as a mix of dried vegetables and wet paper notes. The spicy flavour has also got hints of dark honey, wood and ashy malts. Flat and dry mouthfeel. Strange, but drinkable (Oslo, 04.04.2008).
Bruveris Ingver Alus 10 Gadu Jubilejas Alus;Riga, Latvia;Flavored - Other;Bruveris (Alus Tirdzniecibas Grupa);(BBE 1/08) Golden colored, slightly hazy appearance. Little white head. Sweet honeyish aroma with lots of paper and cardboard, some weird perfumy-grainy note also comes up. Thin to medium bodied. Flavor is more like same than aroma: honey and grainy sweetness with cardboard. Aftertaste is somehow biting and tangy with this cardboard still.
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;[cask at the Wellington, Birmingham] Light, golden colour, quite flat with a thin head and no carbonation. Little initial flavour besides a soft hoppiness, but an attractive dry biscuity malt aftertaste is very welcome. Low abv, so quite light. One of the pack of decent golden ales [17062009]
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;Cask at Spoons, Milton Keynes. Bright gold with a white head. Grassy aroma with a little eggy sulphur. Pleasant sweet malt taste with a little bitterness. Served too cold. Spoons appear to have cranked up the chill during August. But not bad.
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;Cask conditioned handpump Moon On The Square Northampton. A golden coloured beer with a whitish head and lacing. Grassy hops in the nose, and not a lot in the mouth. Pretty boring and thin, and a pale shadow of the GK beer I had just drank. Score 2.7 Subsequent rating scored 2.9. Average becomes 2.8
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;"Cask at the Standing Order (JDW), Stevenage. Straw with a loose white head; sulphurous aroma; pleasant hoppy flavour with a dry hoppy finish. A refreshing pint."
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;Cask gravity, The Cock, Hemingsford Grey, Cambs. Yellow amber under a fleeting white slick. Lemony orange aroma with some musky hop rubs as the head subsides. Herbal grassy and lemon balance, bread, clean fresh biscuity linger. Really sticks around. Tasty solid stuff.
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;Cask (handpump), The Maltings, York, October 2006. This was actually listed as Harrowby Dark, so I was a little surprised when it poured golden and tasted like a pale, fairly hoppy session bitter. There was no proper pump clip, just a hand-written label. Shortly afterwards, however, Yorkshire Dales Darrowby Dark came on so its seems they got their Harrowbys and Darrowbys mixed up. I’m assuming it was actually the Harrowby Pale that I got. The beer? A pleasant, easy drinking, dry session beer. Despite the colour more a bitter than a golden ale.
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Alexandra Hotel, Derby 29/09/2006 Fruit and hop aromas. Clear golden coloured hoppy fruity and slightly pale. Some dryness in a crisp and lasting malt finish.
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;Cask@Swan and Rushes, Leicester. Nice looking pale beer with a light head. The aroma is lightly dry and hopped and the flavour is nice and dry. Overall a good beer.
Oldershaw Harrowby Pale Ale;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oldershaw Brewery;Cask, Swan and Rushes, Leicester. Hazy gold and orange with a small head. Aromas are earthy, spicy hops with mellow lemon. lemon drop sourness with bitter pine. Flavours are dry lemon with caramel malts. Sweet hops with pear and pineapple fruitiness. Spices and light bitterness on the finish. Fairly tasty for its strength.
Wfb Bavarian Crno;Belgrade, Serbia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wfb Bavarian;Tap at Klub Optimist. Proper stout-like pour with huge brownish pillow head. Big bubbles. Bright, strong coffee and malt up front that ease to a porter-like slightly sweet/sour finish. Reminds of some lighter style stouts in north america. Awesome for the region, but the sweetness undercuts it for me.
Wfb Bavarian Crno;Belgrade, Serbia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wfb Bavarian;On tap at Klub Optimist. Very good black beer. Very similar to a flavorful porter. Rich white head with creamy aromas. Flavor is full of chocolate and cream and coffee. So good I went twice.
Wfb Bavarian Crno;Belgrade, Serbia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Wfb Bavarian;"Way better then ""Wfb Svetlo"" but again too thin and watery.Has some fine coffee and dark chocolate aromas but not enough to make it a good Schwarzbier.It’s OK to drink it from time to time..."
MB Light;Novi Sad, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brauerei MB (United Serbian Breweries);Canned(500ml). –Pale golden almost yellow coloured, white head, fizzy. Slight hoppy, bready and some corn notes in aroma. Bitter finish and a bit too watery, drinkable but boring.

Yugen-TTT Èeško Pivo;Šabac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mini Pivara Yugen-TTT;Draft at Belgrade Beer Fest ’09. Best surprise at the fest for me. Didn’t know anything about this brewery (from sabac?!) and this actually blew away the tamno (dark) beer of theirs. Golden-red pour. Light bubbly head. Sweet, sparkling, crisp red beer. Tart with citrus undertones. Slight metallic finish but really good. Best local beer I’ve had in a long while, really reminded me of a good red.
Yugen-TTT Èeško Pivo;Šabac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mini Pivara Yugen-TTT;Draught at the Belgrade Beer Festival. Lovely appearance - dark golden, almost copper in color, solid lasting head. But the taste...very artificial flavors, bland hops flavors, soapy and chemical aromas, traces of yeast, no signs of malt, unpleasant sour aftertaste. In other words - dreadful!
Yugen-TTT Èeško Pivo;Šabac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mini Pivara Yugen-TTT;Piwo z doskonalym chmielowym aromatem, mocna i dobrze wyczuwalna goryczka. Intensywny bursztynowy kolor, klarowne, nagazowanie idealne. Obfita, zwarta, smietankowa piana utrzymujaca sie dlugi czas. Podawane w firmowym szkle. Pite na miejscu w Sabacu
Yugen-TTT Èeško Pivo;Šabac, Serbia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Mini Pivara Yugen-TTT;Draught at the Belgrade Beer Fest 2006. -I think that it became tradition of BBF to have every year one lousy draught beer. Two years ago it was Kej Svetlo and this years laureate is Èeško Pivo from Šabac. Pale golden, huge lasting white head, skunky nose. Slight hoppy and yeasty aroma tipical for slovenian home brewed beers.
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;"It started out with both some yes and some no, and that’s just the way it finished. Head - what head? However, the body was an excellent, rich amber in colour, a little on the hazy end of things. Might’ve been some aroma there, but precious little; perhaps a hint of malt but bugger all else. Taste was ""odd"", not unpleasant but certainly off-putting. Mouhtfeel was may be a little ""sharp"", and the aftertaste was strictly forgettable."
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;Banana notes keep the nose interested. Pleasing color. Light in body. Surprisingly good.
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;Clear amber colour with thin light beige head. Mild spicy nose. Mild yaest and spice taste to start with mild malt midway through and light malt finish.
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;Pours a clear copper color with a thin white head. Good aroma of spicy, biscuity malt. Good flavor of spicy, biscuity malt with a sweet finish. The body is light to medium with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation. Well-done.
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;Bready malt forward aroma with notes of anis and doughy malts. Clear, deep copper coloured body is topped by a low, off white head that recedes to ring. Thick bready malty flavour. Chewy mouthfeel, soft bubbles, medium body with lightly effervescent carbonation. Simple, straight forward but well-made. Sampled with beerbuzzmontreal, cathschlag, Glouglouburp, MartinT, Siroy and Yowie. It’s strange to see the differences in reviews here since I had it with two different groups in Montreal and we all quite enjoyed it and I have had it once more back in BC and enjoyed it then also. One bottle left in the cellar... we’ll have to see how that one turned out?
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;Clear bronze body with no head to speak of. Very malty body with a simple but very pleasant toasted bread and cake flavour. I like very malted beers with a crunchy/chewy body while not being sweet. That’s the case here. The carbonation is low and the drinkability is high. Simple but very effective. Not many ratings so far but I was surprised to see mostly bad reviews except from one which happens to be someone I drank the bottle with. Mmmm…. Weird. Although it wouldn’t be the first time that french speaking quebecois disagree with the rest of the country.
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;Poured a very clear, light brown with a minimal head and some lace. Aromas of caramel, with very light malting. Tastes similar - heavy caramel, very sugary sweet with very light malting and pleasant hops. Unpleasant acrid aftertaste. Carbonation rather nice - weak at first but rolls off the tongue nicely at the end. A drinkable beer, but not in any large quantity. Thankfully I shared a bottle.
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;A dark amber lager with a thin off white head. A rather buttery malt, lots of butterscotch, cloying. In mouth, a lightly sweet caramel malt with some nice peaty notes, woody, but also some boiled corn. Medium bodied. If it wasn’t for the diacetyl and corn, this would be comparable to the Trois Mousquetaires Okto. Thanks Capflu.
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;Bottle: Pours a medium clear copper with an off white head. Great toasty sweet aroma with caramel and marshmallow, candy sugar tones. Flavour was firm malt in the front with a thin ’hollow’ not bitter enough finish that was a let down. Tasted side by side with Granville’s Oktoberfest, and I found the GI to be more rounded. Phillip’s finish let me down.
Phillips Oktoberfest;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Phillips Brewing Co.;Amber body with decent head. Aroma is lots of caramel and metal. Flavour is sweet, thin and with strong diacetyl. Finishes sweet and unpleasant. Just seems to be off.
Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;2019-08-20. Crisp yellow body nice creamy white head. 3+ Aroma has mild lightly floral hops, muted pale malt.

Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;Yellowy gold body and okay foam, sweet cabbagey grain on the nose. Flavour is citrusy grain and nothing else. Medium mouthfeel. Okay, not offensive, which is I suppose the goal for a middle class brewpub lager.
Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;This is my favourite lager so far. There is a nice flavour while swallowing which I suspect is the nuttiness the description suggests. I usually go for Fat Tug IPA or something similar and thought I'd try this for a change. Very happy with it! It is also served at the Pioneer House on the highway in Duncan.
Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;On tap at Craig Street, pours a clear pale golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma is pretty bland even for a lager, with light biscuity malt and straw. Flavour is a bit stale tasting, with straw, biscuity malt and a sort of cardboardy quality. Not too off-putting but it’s a below average pale lager.
Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;Bomber. Clear bright golden yellow, frothy white foam settles and lasts. Grainy buttery lager malt aroma. Mostly clean grainy sweeter lager malt taste, some buttery notes, a hint of citrus. Average carbonation, light bodied, lightly hopped. LF (Lagerboy Friendly)
Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;Draft - As with many of their beers the grains are really evident, making this a pretty flavorful lager.
Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;Light hoppy, grassy aroma - plain. Fairly full bodied for a lager. Clean and smooth with a hint of citrus on the finish. I’m not a big lager drinker, but for the style this was pretty good.
Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy light blond color; served too cold. Simple Lager, with smooth mouthfeel, a hint of crispy malts in aroma and flavor, some corn."
Craig Street Cowichan Bay Lager;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Craig Street Brewing;on tap at brew pub. Crisp and tasty, very mild hop taste and well balanced. I am not a fan of Lagers, but this is a very tasty example and some of the best I have had.

Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;2019-08-20. Crisp amber copper body, modest head. Aroma of mild malt, light caramel and toasty malt. Light mineral undertones. Flavour is mild, lightly toasty malt. Light bitterness. Average bodied palate, moderate carbonation. Okay, not a style I’m personally fond of. 6/3/5/3/11-12 On tap at Craig Street, Duncan, BC.
Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;Coppery brown body and modest foam on top. Soft caramel and brown sugar aroma. Flavour is sweet dark bread with no depth. Mouthfeel is weak. Inoffensive to far past the point of being boring.
Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;On tap @ the brewpub. Ruddy colour. Toasty caramel, nutty. Sticky, light, mild bitterness.
Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;On tap at Jakes At The Lake. Clear medium copper, fading off-white foam. Grainy caramel malty aroma. Moderate caramel chocolate malt taste, not too sweet, a bit sticky, bland earth, no bitterness. Average carbonation, medium bodied, lightly hopped. Not as desireable as Eve the bartender. LBW (Lagerboys Be Wary) ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;Draft. - Caramel, toasted malts and some grain. Clear amber with a thin brown head. Tastes just as it smells with a heavy malt profile.
Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;Pours a deep copper. Aromas of hazelnut, toffee, caramel. Flavours replicate the nose. Low carbonation. The finishing is lingering toffee and nut with a very light bitterness. Decent.
Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy amber color, with creamy head; served too cold. Mild caramel aroma. Some caramel and roasted malt flavor, a bit dusty; correct bitterness. Boring."
Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;on tap at brew pub. Deep brown with a thin head. Nose of caramel and malt. Tasty, but nothing to write home about. Just an ok Irish Ale.
Craig Street Shawnigan Irish Ale;Duncan, British Columbia, Canada;Red Ale - Irish;Craig Street Brewing;On tap at the Alibi Room - pours a deep amber. Flavour is sweet, nutty, and malt-caramel. Quite good, but the different elements don’t work exceptionally well together.

A. Le Coq Linnase-Kali;Tartu, Estonia;Kvass;A. Le Coq (Olvi);1L PET bottle. Dark brown fizzy looking drink. Very sweet, some caramel and faint raisins in aroma. Very sweet, caramel and some rye in taste. Very sharp and fizzy carbonation.
A. Le Coq Linnase-Kali;Tartu, Estonia;Kvass;A. Le Coq (Olvi);2l bottle, Tallinn. Very sweet fizzy kvass. Tasty breadiness, and caramel, but not special, just a chemical soft drink, and definitely not a beer.
A. Le Coq Linnase-Kali;Tartu, Estonia;Kvass;A. Le Coq (Olvi);Canned. Hazy dark brown colour, small beige head. Strong ryebready malts in aroma. Flavour is strong ryebread, malts and coca-cola. Aftertaste is caramellish rye and malts.
A. Le Coq Linnase-Kali;Tartu, Estonia;Kvass;A. Le Coq (Olvi);"Can (BB 06/2007). Very dark ruby brown, small tan head. Strong rye bread aroma. Very cloying sweet, sugary. Carbonated. Rye bread flavors. Some ""real kvass"" qualities, but way too sugary to enjoy really."
Spinnakers Fog Fighter Cherry;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;I’ll preface by saying I really enjoy the standard Fog Fighter. However, this spin-off was pretty poor. Sickly sweet and with a cherry cough syrup flavour that stuck on my palate until I could wash it away. A rare miss from a usually solid brewer.
Spinnakers Fog Fighter Cherry;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Spinnakers Brewpub;Cloudy pinkish-brown. Cinnamon, sugar and alcohol aroma. Hmmmm...cherry pie concentrated, but it clashes with the spicy, alcoholic tripel that lies underneath. It just ends up being too sweet, since the Fog Fighter is quite sweet to begin with, and the alcohol is never something I welcome in a fruit beer. They also have a cranberry version, which I missed, and that sounds like a better combo on paper.
Fat Cat Honey Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fat Cat Brewery;Not much of a head on this one, and what there was ran away quite quickly. The aroma was indeed that of honey, and the colour was a cloudy amber. Taste was not at all sweet, leaning more toward the malt side of things, with some hopped bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent. A drinkable beer, but by no means a remarkable or even a particularly good beer.
Fat Cat Honey Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fat Cat Brewery;650ml bomber from a BIF : Poured a dark gold with a smallish cap that didn’t last well. Aromas are a tad flat, mostly grains sweetness and some must. Flavor is malty-sweet, some floral a bit of grass and a wet malty sweet finish. Not really my type of honey beer but I suspect this sample was on the shelf a while.
Fat Cat Honey Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fat Cat Brewery;Sweet raspberry honey aroma. Somewhat hazy yellow. Consistent honey character, light malts.
Fat Cat Honey Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fat Cat Brewery;Bottle, courtesy matta. Pours deep gold with copper core and off white head. The aroma is honey and malt sweetness followed by infected bottle acidity and tartness. The taste is both honey sweet and malty sweet followed by tart acidity as noted in the nose. But the tartness is milder than the nose hinted at. Toward the finish I also get a metal note. Not so good.
Fat Cat Honey Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fat Cat Brewery;courtesy of matta with an A. Pours hazy golden, with white lacing. Aroma is hoppy with a syrupy / honey nose. Taste has some faint notes of honey with high carbonation and a thick mouthfeel. Sweet with plenty of honey. Good but nothing spectacular.
Fat Cat Honey Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fat Cat Brewery;Bottle, courtesy MattA. Pours a golden hue, with wet lacing and a creamy head. Honey nose, dry hops, some brown sugar. Flavor is a bit infected, with honey and biscuit. Kind of plain and just not that good. Crisp, hard to stomach overall.
Fat Cat Honey Ale;Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fat Cat Brewery;Pear, orange rind in nose, some honey in background. Pop-like, lots of apple juice notes, thick but flat body. Plain, not much aftertaste to speak of. Not bad.

Lunar ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Draft at Cask Night at the Park Pub--this was one of the cask offerings. Nice stuff. Lunar somehow seems like the forgotten ale lineup for Baron, but some of that talent and attention to detail shows through on the top-fermented side now and then. Maybe if I’m not thinking of Lunar often enough, it’s my fault, not theirs. This one poured a deep mahogany with brilliant garnet highlights. Nice creamy/sudsy tan head. Not very like an ESB, and not very like a casked ESB, at that. Mild brown sugar and even licorice notes on the nose, swirling around a tea and biscuit mix that’s actually quite palatable and understated. More of the same weird dry/sweet dichotomy happening on the mid-palate, with a nice light, clean, drinkable body. Neutral finish. Startlingly good, without a doubt.
Lunar ESB;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Hazy dark amber. Very caramelly nose. Chewy Munich/Vienna malt character. Light earthy hops. Fairly sweet finish.
Russell Lychee Peach Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;Cloudy yellow. Light aroma of peach and pale malt. Crazy tart peach-lychee juice. Light fruity bitterness. Not entirely cohesive as a beer but good as a fruit juice.
Swans Smooth Sailing Honey Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Swans Brewpub;pours topaz with a thick foamy head, foamy retention, sticky lacing, very active fast moving CO2 streams. Muted nose. Drinks 6/10-sweetness level, watery texture, aggressive burpy carbonation, tastes of bittersweet honey, hints of grapefruit, ends with a lingering sharp bitter hoppy finish. Medium complexity, medium depth, okay carry, good transitions, good drinkablility. A variety of elements - sweet, bitter, hoppy, crisp, honey. Too watery and thin for my tastes however.
Swans Smooth Sailing Honey Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Swans Brewpub;5 ounce sample seasonal draft at the Swans bar at $10.00CAD for 6-samples. Very good.
Swans Smooth Sailing Honey Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Swans Brewpub;pours a yellow with a nice sweet honey aroma and honey taste but also very pale flavours and light on the palate
Swans Smooth Sailing Honey Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Swans Brewpub;Hazy gold,fast fading beige head. Neutral nose, Light sweet profile, bland and boring
Swans Smooth Sailing Honey Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Swans Brewpub;"Had this at a cask festival at Central City; the version was slightly different from the norm (no details provided). Aroma has strong honey notes. A light body with a sweet attack yields a very clean, crisp finish. A good summer/patio ale, but really not that remarkable."
Swans Smooth Sailing Honey Ale;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Swans Brewpub;Pours a clear pale yellow with a finger-thick egg-white head & some lacing with an unremarkable aroma - no honey yet. Taste is very refreshing, solid pale malt with a leafy green hop taste and definite honey in the finish. Body is crisp and tightly carbonated (served on draught). Well executed, nice honey taste, otherwise unremarkable.

Central City Chipotle Amber;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Central City Brewers + Distillers;These beers are hard to rate but i give it a thumbs up. The heat (spiciness) is well done, and shows up a lingering hot finish. You couldn’t drink a six pack, but one is ok.
Central City Chipotle Amber;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Central City Brewers + Distillers;GCBF sample. Cap and Oakes are joking right? Light peppery nose. Clear gold. Starts OK but builds to heartburn. Not what I want in my glass, or my mouth.

The malts and body were a bit thin, but the flavour was fresh and big chipotle. The finish had a mild, insistent heat.

Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;Tap in Frankfurt at a Restaurant. Nose is watery apple, some wood, dried apple. Palate is sweet and sour apple, watery pear, some vanilla. Ok Apfelwein.
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;From fass in a cafe in the Frankfurt Altstadt romer square. My first Apfelwein. Cloudy orange color, flat. Simple nsoe or apple, tartness, light tannins. Semi tart flavor, semi sweet as well, dry but not very taniic and quite fruity and nice.
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;Hazy orange color with no head. Aroma is tart apples, some yeast. Taste is sour, some milky yeasts. No carbonation. Not too complex, but fun.
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;Säuerlich apfeliger Antrunk. Rund fruchtig, etwas steigende Fruchtnoten, milde Herbe. Trockenes rundes Ende. 9/9/9/9/11/9
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;Thanks to erzengel for sharing!! Pours a hazy apple juice color with some bubbles sticking around. The smell is deep apple aroma, some tartness lingering. The taste is earthy apples, some tartness ending dry. Light in body but with some graininess and light carbonation.
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;Ich mein, ich mag ja saure Sachen. Selbst Essig probiere ich gerne auf einem Teelöffel pur als kleinen Geschmackstest nach dessen Kauf. Aber irgendwo hört der Spaß mit der Säure auf. Selbst als gelegenlicher Granny Smith Genießer bin ich von dieser Mischung übelst geschockt. Sicher, Äpfelchen und Zitrönchen sind hier sicher im Aroma. Doch der Geschmack ähnelt eher dem Zitrönchen - und das passt mir herzlich wenig
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;Sample from Erzengel, thank you! The Apfelwein has got a hazy golden-orange body with a flat body. Low carbonation. Aroma of ripe, green apples, acid and fields. Taste of crisp apples, green apples, leaves. Harsh one, yet surely a good example of a standard Apfelwein. Little bit too sour for me though.
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;Hazy in the glass, fresh and a bit neutral beginning. The cider starts fruity and a bit watery. Fresh, smooth, fruity and quite dry. Nice ripe apples, fresh, smooth, not too deep. The aftertaste is round and smooth, dry, no tannins, smooth, fruity and easy to drink.
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;Bottle, probably from a Tegut in Marburg. So, this one is unfiltered, let’s see what difference it makes. Misty chalky yellow body with a tiny head. Sweet apple nose, kinda nice, slightly vinuous. Hm, not bad so far. The taste is... damn, dusty, mild appley taste, getting tangy in the end, vague glue, somewhat dusty. Ok at first, this somehow became more and more sour later on as it was open, ending up being less inspiring that it first was. Somehow. Meh. For the price, I shouldn’t complain.
Rapp's Meisterschoppen;Karben, Hesse, Germany;Apple Cider;Rapp's Kelterei;"Bottle from Marktkauf, Speyer The color is blond, very cloudy; while pouring it seems that the carbonation is low. There is a light aroma, a bit fruity and lemony, sour, and, as often for German ciders, also a scent of warm plastic (it reminds me the lights on the Christmas tree). The lack of carbonation improves the mouthfeel; the flavor is anyway quite simple, without clear fruits, and instead a white wine impression, and light acidity. At least, compared to may German ciders, this one doesn’t have all the flaws that the others have."
Dogfish Head Ginger Peach Wheat;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;Not a big fan of this. The peach aroma was there but the flavor was missing and the overall experience was just lacking.
Dogfish Head Ginger Peach Wheat;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;"You know that book ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" by Milan Kundaris? And the joke is that ""unbearable"" connotes heavy, so it’s a heavy lightness? This beer has been reading that book."
Dogfish Head Ginger Peach Wheat;Milton, Delaware, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Dogfish Head Brewery;At brewpub in Sept. Pour was a hazy yellow/brown color witha small white head. Aroma really is mostly Peaches and ginger. The flavors are the same with some iced tea hints. Not bad.

Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;[Cask at Milton Keynes Beer Festival 2011] This was only 6.5%ABV, so don’t know if it’s a different version or just a batch that turned out differently? Pale gold. Taste more reminiscent a cider than a perry, albeit cider tinged with a hint of pear drops. Alcohol shows through quite strongly, giving a slight (but not overwhelming and unpleasant) hint of nail varnish remover. Sweet (but not sickly), with just a dry hint in the finish - it did remind me of sherry as others have said, but a pale, medium-dry sherry. Decent effort this.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;Polycask at Merton Summer Beer Festival July 19th Strange one this the aroma is the first thing that i ntrigued me at first I thought rum but then when chatting to friend Bob we felt that it could have been aged in a sherry cask. It pours very light in colour light straw colour and the taste is in my opinion a little too strong and unbalanced what pear there is seems to be fighting a losing battle with the spoirit to assert itself. A lot of people liked this, I thought it was just about ok.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;Bottle. Tastes quite spirity and sweet, has some slight dessert wine characters. Some pruny fruit, with spirity pear flavours, with some warming alcohol. This was pretty good.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;LCRBM2. Musty, spongy aroma. Looks like white wine. Fermented pear flavor obviously, sherrylike notes, wooden finish. Oily mouthfeel.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;Bottled - LCRBM2 - A clear lime green coloured perry. The aroma is very alcoholic, seems like a pear licqueur or a spirit. The taste is also very heavy and strong. Very sweet, pear fruits. Too much alcohol for me, but then this bottle was over 12 months old, so it may actually have picked up strength from its original 9.5% over the time.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;Bottle at LCRBM 2, Kulminator, Antwerp, Belgium Clear, pale, yellow body. Looks like a watery wine. Aroma of liquor and pears. Watery, alcoholic, peary flavour. Moderately sweet.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;LCRBM2. Thanks to maeib for this one. Clear pale gold, no head. Varnish aroma. Crude. Very alcoholic and I can’t get past that varnish flavour and aroma.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;Bottled, LCRBM. Aroma of apple, apple, more apple and some alcohol. Yellow color, clear body, no head or lace of course. Sweet, apple, hint of varnish, sticky and very warming.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;LCRBM2: Pear, a bit sugary and very alcoholic. Some oak in the aftertaste. Vinous. Not something I’d look for.
Windmill Perry;Hellidon, Northamptonshire, England;Perry;Windmill Cider;[2nd Low Countries RateBeer meeting] The aroma is winey/sherry-like with pear and alcohol. Indeed more a wine appearance and colour, no head. Woody sweet sherry taste with some pear fruitiness. Quite alcoholic. Not my thing.
Silverton Imogene Pass Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;IPA;Silverton Brewery;This IPA was OK, it was not make the brewer on staff now. The new IPA is much better, it’s won medals. The old brewer is in Durango the owner said, so avoid those brews!!
Silverton Imogene Pass Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;IPA;Silverton Brewery;This beer is called Ice Pick Ale now... And they are going to stop making it... Good thing. Hoppy and citru nose(smells better than it taste) Pour light orange but a very watery body and mouthfeel. Flavor had no balence way to bitter
Silverton Imogene Pass Ale;Silverton, Colorado, United States;IPA;Silverton Brewery;"Originally designed as an IPA, this pale ale has a mellow, yet full hop aroma. The color is almost amber, but not too dark. It develops a nice head, which could be slightly heavier. This ale is extremely drinkable, but pleases at each sip; characteristic of a good english pub ale. The IPA origin of this beer is evident in its hop profile. This beer also finishes clean, and is best after warming a little."
Standing Stone Tri-Centennial Amber;Ashland, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Standing Stone Brewing Company;Tasted on tap at Brewpub in Ashland. This amber pours a dark copper color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is cereal malts and citrusy hops. A medium bodied amber. Malts are caramel, fruity and sweet. Hops are aggressive for an amber and citrusy.

Well balanced. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.

Great Wall Dark;Beijing, China;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Wall Restaurant;"[Draught at the restaurant] Funny place for a brewery. If it wasn’t for the sign ""fresh beer"" I wouldn’t have guessed that they had a brewery inside the restaurant (actually the lagering tanks were on display in another section of the restaurant, called ""Beijing Roast Duck"", I believe) Well, the beer came absolutely pitch black with small beige head. The aroma held generous amonuts of chocoalate and some licorice. It was medium bodied with rounded mouthfeel. Chocolate dominates, but there are notes of tar as well. Full flavoured with medium bitterness. As enjoyable as the superb Chongqing Chicken here, and at around a 5th of the price of the beers at Paulaner 300m away a bargain."

Papago Hop Dog IPA 7%;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;On tap @ Papago. A nice light orange with foamy yellow head.

Papago Hop Dog IPA 7%;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;Had this cask conditioned with hops. That influences this A LOT. I have since had it non-cask conditioned and its pretty pedestrian CASK CONDITIONED:. This was the perfect IPA, with full hop flavoring, yet with a creamy smoothness that I’ve never seen in an IPA. The stuff was a nice warm pint, that laced like a doily. Golden Amber - I think they really hit paydirt with this cask conditioning. The staff told me they dry hopped the hell out of this stuff, with a bunch of hops sitting in the cask. NORMAL: Pretty boring IPA. It’s in the WC IPA tradition, so its pretty hop forward, which I like. But nothing really striking about the hop profile.

Nice lacing as a filmy layer with decent ringer head. Aromas are green and fresh, floral and earthy, gentle resiny quality as the fruit shows mellow to minimal life.

Mellow pithy citrus, some earth, a bit of sweetness as we round the corner shows some bread, biscuit, a touch of caramel.

Grand Union One Hop: Sovereign;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask at Wenlock Arms. Clear copper with a small white head. Earthy pine tree hops is the main attraction here. Little malt presence with a dry wood character. Finish is rather short with medium bitterness. Simple but effective. Looks like Grand Union have been brewing a new “One Hop” ale almost every mouth for the past 2-3 years. Same recipe but each using a single different hop. While I was in London the Sovereign was the One Hop of the month. I think it would be very instructive to taste them all, and rarely can I associate the word instructive with my drinking habits.
Pickwick Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Harpoon Brewery;Nice golden colour with a decent white head. Good lacing. Fresh hoppy and fruity aroma.

North Cotswold Monarch IPA;Stretton on Fosse, Warwickshire, England;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;North Cotswold Brewery;bottle from Darts Farm. Hazy golden colour, oildy consistency, no head to speak off, perhaps some bubbles. Sweet and sticky with lots of alcohol flavours, and some hoppy flavours in the far background. Very disappointing.

Amber with a thin off white head. Nose comprises dark caramel malt, tropical fruit, ripe mango, booze and a little spice. Tastes of bitter grapefruit, rich tropical fruits, orange pith, sweet malt, candied sugar, light pineapple. Fuller end of medium bodied with fine carbonation leading to a bitter sweet finish. Alcohol is evident but not OTT. Flavoursome and well executed for a 10% cask DIPA!

North Cotswold Monarch IPA;Stretton on Fosse, Warwickshire, England;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;North Cotswold Brewery;30th December 2008. Hazy brown beer, very frothy head but it quickly dies away to nothing. Soft and creamy IPA - the hops are juicy and not overpowering and impart a soft marmalade flavour. A nice undertone of creamy malt. Finishes with warming hints of port. Very civilised and tasty!
North Cotswold Monarch IPA;Stretton on Fosse, Warwickshire, England;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;North Cotswold Brewery;Bottle 50cl. @ [ Chris O’s pre NYE Tasting ]. Clear medium amber orange color with a large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate malty, caramel, strawberry notes, light to moderate hoppy, orange.

North Cotswold Monarch IPA;Stretton on Fosse, Warwickshire, England;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;North Cotswold Brewery;Bottle at Chris o New Year tasting 08/09. It’s alright. Quite a stable 10% IPA with decent flavours. It’s got a pretty good malty backbone, but it’s ok hop. Not too aggressive.
North Cotswold Monarch IPA;Stretton on Fosse, Warwickshire, England;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;North Cotswold Brewery;Bottle from Pigs Ear 08. Lots of cabaonation in a reddish beer. Very full bodied. Loads of malt, hoppy aroma more than dryness, some yeast. Somehow it comes out balanced, the alcohol is not very evident, but that is due to all the other ingredients. Peppery, dryish finish.
"Watch City The ""CAZ"" Scotch Export Ale";Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;on tap-pours an off white head and copper/red color. Aroma is sweet medium malt-caramel. Taste is scotch, sweet medium malt-caramel, secondary hops bitterness. Thicker mouth feel.
"Watch City The ""CAZ"" Scotch Export Ale";Waltham, Massachusetts, United States;Scottish Ale;Watch City Brewing Co.;"Cask pint at Watch City on 9/9/06. Nearly ""bright"" though with just a touch of light haze. Still transparent and with a large, grey/beige head that is tremendously well-retained and laces quite profusely. The body is a deep copper-auburn with strong mahogany tones. Fresh edinburgh yeast contributes light earthy/soiliness, while some moderate dark malts contribute very subtle dark fruit flavors in concert with the yeast notes. Minimal hop apparency, though some green leafiness and bits of grass do help bolster the livliness of it. Touches of very light caramel, pale sugars and a hint of coffee on the end. Notes are presented cleanly, crisply and the aroma is quite strong and vibrant. No alcohol noted, definitely no flaws that I can detect. Very inviting. A warm, fuzzy-soft texture is alive with fruit, nuts, dry caramel and some dusty/earthy yeast on the end. Snappy esters dry out the finish and give it a crispness that belies the low gravity nature of the beer. Plenty of nougat and dark berry notes packed in here, and just a clean presentation with surprisingly little wateriness, even less than what would be expected/tolerable. Goes down softly and easily. I think I drank my pint in about 2 minutes. One of the better conditions I’ve seen a cask in, here in New England."

At the same time some rubbery smoked notes, near-medicinal like an Islay whiskey - must be that coolship?

Tahquamenon Falls Tannin Red;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Pour of mahogany-tinted red, with fringes of basketball. Head of creamy ivory. Faint malt and pizza sauce aroma. Served ice cold. There’s no carbonation in this beer, it’s becoming to be a trademark of this brewery. Maybe I could at least convince them to serve their beer on oxygen. There really isn’t flavor here, just some dryness that acts as such and there could maybe be a hint of hop sugars. Ick. I think they distilled the tannins from the river water and added it to this thing they attempt to call beer. Palate is exceptionally revolting. It has a painful scorching dryness that scours the tongue and burns the roof of your mouth. Garbage. they really need to go out of business and stop embarassing craft beer.
Columbus Brewing Amber Ale;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Columbus Brewing Company;Draft at CBC. Poured dark amber with an average fizzy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate caramel malt and sour citrus aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Medium balanced flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Better than my expectations.
Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;Fun take on a traditional style. Plenty of rye hops to make this interesting and somewhat of a hop presence as well. Overall, quite enjoyable.
Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;Retro. Dark orange-amber pour. Noticed a missing favorite (in-style at least) when updating those. Hoppier than expected (kinda like Hopzeit) but biscuit & spice still king. nice malty finish, lightly bitter.
Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;"From May 2008 I got this can in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! Yet another Surly beer for me to try. ;^) This pours a slightly hazy amber with a big +2 finger head of billowy foam. I see some floaties but I'm hoping that won't negatively impact the flavour. Oh and there's plenty of sticky lacing. The smell is very nice! Lots of lemon citrus matched equally by lots of rye and some caramel malt. To me, a perfectly balanced nose. The taste...hell, there's no denying that this is a beer using rye as it's right there and it's tasting great. The single hop that they are using gives me both lemon and some pine and the rye and a bit of caramel malt compliments the hops very nicely. Good medium mouthfeel and fairly light carbonation make for a very drinkable beer. This is just a real palate pleasing, easy drinking brew and I could drink a few of these easily without getting bored. With the final pour, I didn't get any more floaties,(a good thing)just more of that hazy amber goodness. Btw, great head retention here. Well done, again, Surly! Bottom line: This is a very tasty and drinkable Rye beer that I wouldn't hesitate to try again. Highly recommended!"
Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;On tap at Ellyn's Tap & Grill in Glen Ellyn, IL., shaker served displaying a clear & bright, amber hue, with a presentable layer of persistent, off white froth, and sheeting spray as lacing. The nose was mild grain, toast, with slight hints of citrus & spice. Medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste was like notes, including an earthy, toasted/near roasted, dry, and lingering bitterness. Rye made the difference as I appreciated the more German-style approach for a welcome change from the usual caramel sweet, Americanized versions.
Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;Pours slightly hazy golden orange with a thick beige head. Aroma is roasted malts and sweetness. Flavour is sweet but not too heavy but very malty. Finish is a little thick and slightly sweet.
Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;Deep amber in color with some nice spice character from the rye bill. I understand they are wanting to do something different, but stylistically, this is terrible. The style should have little to no hop character, but this has hop aroma and taste. Decent for what it actually is, but a poor representation of the indicated style.
Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;Pours a clear orange/amber with a not too impressive off white head. Aroma is piney cones.

Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;not quite sweet enough for me. the rye is definitely unique but i tend to look for more traditional when it comes to oktos. its very smooth and well rounded, no off notes whatsoever. but not quite what i was looking for.
Surly SurlyFest;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Surly Brewing Company;16floz can, COD: 08.22.2017, paid $10 for a four-pack, poured this one into a mug glass. Looks good, amber in color with a small head that fizzles a bit. I can smell that this is an American remix of the style - hoppy like a forest of pines. Rye comes through in the palate, along with buttery biscuit, and herb bitterness. Good as American amber ale/lager (whatever yeast was used).

Het bier is kraakhelder van kleur met een koolzuurrijke schuimkraag die snel tot een minimum reduceerd. Aroma is citroenachtig. Smaak is wat vlak, beetje zacht in de nasmaak. Ik heb betere radlers op maar alsnog is deze op een warme dag goed te drinken mits je niet al te hoge verwachtingen hebt.

Ottos Roggenbock;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a dark reddish-brown color with a small tan head. The aroma is spicy rye and crisp malts. The flavor is sharp and crisp spicy rye with a moderate floral hop presence. The finish is long and bitter. The rye is definitely noticeable.
Ottos Roggenbock;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Dark muddy maple brown colored body with a light tan film of a head. Nose has sweet maple syrup, light wood, brown sugar and caramel chocolate nuts. Texture is the most noticeable attribute of this beer, as it’s incredibly creamy and silky, full on the palate as well, not frothy at all, and not undercarbonated, but just really chewy and savory. The maple syrup component is lighter in the flavor than in the nose, and is complimented by a doughy yeast and toast flavor and some light oak and caramel. Overall it’s very tasty, though a little too sweet, and could benefit from some smoke. I would say it sits between doppelbock and bock, but has the gravity of doppelbock.
Multi-Brasses Pentecote Brune;Tingwick, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Multi-Brasses;Originally rated February 2007. Weird... comes in a bomber, but with a twist-off neck. Pours a dark brown colour with mohagony highlights. Tanned head with nice lacing and a ring that stays (unlike the head). Very slow carbonation. Malty nose with a sweetness of red apples. Thin mouthfeel with very little stickiness. At first, a real bad taste with some rustiness and mild infection. Then, the mouth got used to it, and got better. The red apples are there too, with the malt. Interesting aftertaste, where roasted malt appears and then, some very light chocolat. Alcohol is very well-hidden and drinkability is decent. Will stick with Unibroue for Quebec 9% ABV beers.

Multi-Brasses Pentecote Brune;Tingwick, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Multi-Brasses;"Okay clear amber body with no carbonation, decent pillow of head on top. Aroma is a soft mix of malt and fertilizer.

Multi-Brasses Pentecote Brune;Tingwick, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Multi-Brasses;Bottle. Brown pour. Aroma is yeasty, fruity and smells quite tart. And damn its tart as hell. At first it seemed like it might be past its prime. But upon reading older reviews we realized the sourness was intentional. Not bad. at all. Sour, fruit, wet earth and wood.
Multi-Brasses Pentecote Brune;Tingwick, Quebec, Canada;Dubbel;Multi-Brasses;Brown. Flat-looking, slight haze. Deep fruity aroma shows hints of tartness. Very tart palate. Dry, fruity, going Flemish. Dark fruit and wood. There’s two reasons to rate a two-year-old dubbel that’s gone sour. One is that the early ratings indicate tartness so this was always in the beer. The second is that this beer gone sour is actually pretty tasty.

Birrificio Artigiano Montemagno;Bientina (PI), Italy;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Birrificio Artigiano Orzo Bruno;"Plastic cup of takeout from Orzo Bruno reeling tipsily around the streets of Pisa. Murky ruby with a collapsing halo. Lush dubbel-esque aroma of ripe plum and brown sugar; some boozy banana and coconut tropical esters milling about. Thick medicinal mouth with bags of sweetness, but not overdone; balancing hop with savoury orange and juniper freshness like a Belgian blond, or Tripel even. Goldings, Poperinge, pinch of spice? Strange and lovely balance, milkshake thick and luxurious. Grenadine and dry roasted nut hints kicking in as it warms. Very cheeky little sipper sliding down sweetly with a dusting of Belgian devilry."

Again, mint and an abundance of bitterness. Medium body with champagne like carbonation. Good points, bad points. The sharpness and uber dryness make it not overly drinkable.

Sweet aromas of barley, honey, yeast and citrus. The taste is really sour and the sourness hits you as soon as it touches your lips. Tastes strongly of sage, lemon and grapefruit with a hint of barley. A sweet and sour finish. Very light carbonation (I suspect it hasn’t bottle conditioned, despite being given adequate time to do so). How can you rate something derived from a unique blend of herbs, since you don’t know how it’s supposed to taste....? Anyway, if you like sour ales (I don’t) then you’ll love this. For me, this was an experience worth having but not one I’d care to repeat.
Struise Tsjeeses;Oostvleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Struise Brouwers;"330 ml “2015"" version bought at HKBWEX in mong Kok. Looks: Clear amber copper colour with a thick ring of dirt-like yeast sediments; Last than one-quarter finger head with soapy off-white foam which fades in 10 seconds; Poor sticky lacing with quite fizzy carbonation. Aroma: Fragrant and sweet full amber malt, with strong caramel, toffee, alcohol, apricots, yellow fruits, floral, sugar, light spices, thick bread, strong yeast, light lemon and grass. Taste: Mid to strong sweet amber malt, with liquor-like alcohol, light caramel and toffee, floral, sugar, light spices, dry bread, yeast, lemon, fair bitter hops and grass. Body: Full body. Quite thick and slick palate. Mouth Feel: Full amber maltyness in a slightly thin but slick background. Pretty much devoid of characters except strong bready dryness and lingering Ambrée-like liquor. Caramel / toffee and fruity esters are traces only. Light flowery with pleasing strong sweetness. Yeasty, light spicy with lemon to round. Boring! Hoppiness: Floral, light spices, light lemon and grass in nose and taste; Bitterness is light for an abrupt, low astringent sweet Amber malty finish. After Taste: Dry. Bready yeasty and light bitter to mouth. Comments: Previously I had the ""Tsjeeses Reserva - Bourbon BA"" and it was a disasterous sweet bomb. This original Tsjeeses is less sweet, a lot dryer and yeasty but nothing more. It lacks characters in all area, it is easy to drink and inoffensive, but otherwise totally pointless as an Ambrée. One of the most disappointing beers by Struise. Sad."
Struise Tsjeeses;Oostvleteren, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;De Struise Brouwers;Bottle, the 2015 variety. The beer has a strong, full feel and a slightly sweet taste. Would be much better without that subtle boozy finish.
Duysters Tuverbol;Diest, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);The aroma of the Bretts, a bit of straw. Bright straw color, slightly cloudy with good white foam. On the palate, esters, a slight acidity, malt, a little hop in a dry aftertaste. The body is medium, carbonation is large.
Duysters Tuverbol;Diest, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);Dark golden colour. Very interesting mix. Aroma is very yeasty and has light funk but also candy sugar in the background. Flavour starts with candy sweetness before the dryness and yeastiness kicks in. Finish has a light tang.
Duysters Tuverbol;Diest, Belgium;Sour / Wild Beer;Brouwerij Loterbol (was Duysters);37.5cl bottle at home. Appearance: hazy golden with medium sized, pretty stable white head. Aroma: very much like a lambic, much more than 1/10 lambic, as it seems to me. Notes of brett, apple, slightly malty, honey, funky, hint of nutmeg and stonefruits. Taste: above medium sweetness, medium bitterness and ever so slightly tart. Notes of sweet malts, brett, red apples, apricot jam, some clove, hint of grapeskins and honey. Palate: medium bodied, slightly sticky and oily texture, medium carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall: wow, this is something. To me, this is the perfect belgian beer. The warmth, spice and body of a tripel with the fruits and that crisp tartness of a lambic. Very well done. Maybe not the best sour/wild beer, but a the absolute winner in between the Tripel and Sour style

OWA Iwai Beer;Bruxelles, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Dark / Amber;OWA Brewery SPRL;I got this OWA Japanese ceramic type glass and decided to break it in with their brown beer paired with some cheese, Polish pâté and fresh bread. The aroma is deep dark delicious figs and candies fruits while the taste is big caramel syrup, dark candies fruits and a rough dry finish. The finish gives some cinnamon spice notes but I’d say it’s a pretty average Belgian Dark Ale. The cheese accentuates the sharply of the beer and vice-versa, not really such a good pairing. The late and bread accentuated the caramel and maltiness which worked very well together delivering a slight boost in flavor to both. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Redolent with dark chocolate, thids dry style stout was sweeter than others that share the style. A syrupy molasses sweetness envelops the tongue at the finish. This lacks the roasty bitter character of its cousing, Peg Leg. Not at all bad, but overshadowed by its older cousin.

Ramsgate East Kent Pale Ale;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);On cask at Bruxellensis. This brew was a lot more floral then the No. 3. The hops actuall displayed some of their floral character and not just their bitterness. Malts were light up front with a bit more fruitiness showing as it finished. Very light on the palate without a strong flavor, kinda tough being a subtle flavor brew in a mostly belgian beer festival.
Ramsgate East Kent Pale Ale;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Pleasant Pale Ale. Had a fair bit of this recently. Both in Brussels (?!) and Locally at home.

Dryish finish.

Pours crystal clear with a short-lived frothy head, plenty of lacing while the head lasted, a coarse persistent bead. Golden straw in colour. On the nose, strong biscuity malts at first, but quickly fading. In the mouth, average carbonation, medium body, releasing some biscuit and bready malt flavours with hints of honey, but no real hop presence, minimal sweetness and a mid bitter finish. Overall, quite malty and not badly balanced, but ultimately just another forgettable Eastern European lager.

Rich, bready malt nose with spicy, slightly lemony hops. Almost clear gold with a low, thick head. Flavor of spicy hops, minerals, and crisp, crackery malt.

Clear golden body with a small, vanishing white head. Aroma is cereals, mild grassy. Taste is malty again, cereals and some honey. Long grassy finish. Low body, soft carbonation, watery texture. To clear to be a keller, no yeasty notes at all. Where is the fresh baked bread of a Fränkisches Kellerbier. I think the doggos here did not handle the keg with care.

Weißenoher Eucharius Märzen;Weißenohe, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Klosterbrauerei Weißenohe;Nice, heavy swingtop bottle, suitable for homebrew. Decent label of a napping monk. Foggy, dark tea colored brew with a respectable oatmeal head which sticks to the side of the glass. Very pleasant, nutty, slightly grassy malt aroma with distinct honey tones. Very smooth, very very nice. Sweet, malt forward, toasted straw and leathery notes, somewhat tannic. Very much en pointe and to style. Only complaint is that the brew went a little flat. Beer Stop, Tallahassee.
Weißenoher Eucharius Märzen;Weißenohe, Bavaria, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Klosterbrauerei Weißenohe;"Bottle from Arden Wines, March 2016. 2:30am. My least favourite of the Weissnoher quartet (sounds like a 40s bebop combo) but still a decent beer. Fliptop pouring slightly veiled bronze with a fine narrow cream collar. House nutty, praline, cherry blossom, shrubby hop, toffee-hinting, Hovis biscuit nose. Sweet again but balanced and nuanced enough to keep you pivoting your elbow and searching for metaphors; milk chocolate, cherry, marzipan, toffee popcorn, thistle and digestives this time. I’m talking bollocks- this is just as good as the others; 737314."

Archers Old Bill Bitter;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Archers (Evan Evans);Pint in Lewes, East Sussex. Ive searched this beer on the net and it says it is dis continued, but believe me it was on tap in this pub. I forget the name of the pub but the owner is from Swindon. Dark amber in appearance with a good creamy looking head. Strong taste, but not to pleasant. However I was in need of a beer with some flavour so enjoyed it.
Legend Lager #2;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Legend Brewing Company;Not sure what to call this. Interestingly enough, the waitress claimed this had been made with the Hefe yeast. Who knows. Pale yellow, little head. Aroma faintly spicy. Flavor was almost all yeast, the light malts of the lager utterly obliterated. Flavors were spicy, a bit of clove, and some coconut, a flavor component I don’t think I’ve ever picked up in a beer before. Not awful, but definitely experimental. Really highlighted the yeast in a big way.
Legend Lager #2;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Legend Brewing Company;Pours a mustard yellow color with a white head. It has a faint aroma of bananas. This lager is spicy with notes of cinamon, cardamom, and mase with a creamy banana flavor. It’s banana bread in lager form (well, not exactly your typical lager form). Only available at Legend Brewing Co. on tap.
Legend Lager #2;Richmond, Virginia, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Legend Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Clear golden body with a medium frothy white head. Sweet light banana aroma. Very light banana flavor, with some light hops. Originally they were trying to crisp up the lager, but they went a tad overboard on the belgian yeast giving this a definite hefe feel. I’d call it a Kristallweizen but it doesnt have the requisite wheat.

Pale gold body with a frothy white head. A belgian yeast style aroma, banana and wheat. Taste is similar, bready, banana and some light malts, hops are rather limited. Almost a hefeweizen, but definitly a lager.
Fort Street Jell-in Like Magellan;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Porter;Fort Street Brewery;Tap, 9-07-06. Black with beige head, fades to film. Aroma has light fruit up front, coffee tends to dominate through the middle. Flavor, coffee front to back, bif choclate character as it warms. Nice brew, coffee tad too much for me though.

Overall a nice enjoyable beer."
Iron Hill Double Red;Wilmington, Delaware, United States;Strong Ale - American;Iron Hill Wilmington;This beer was listed on their Features menu as ’Red Cindy’, but seemed to match the description of this beer. So instead of added a new beer, I’ll just go ahead and submit my rating under this name. It seems to have many aliases anyway. But by whatever name you call it, this was one fantastic beer! It pours a beautiful amber color with a copper hue. The head was little off-white and left a ton of lacing around the glass. The nose was full of pine, grapefruit, grass, lemon and a hint of caramel. The flavors were inticing and delicious, with dry and bitter notes of piney and flowery hops, a touch of caramel, grass, earth and wood. The balance was superb and the drinkability was outstanding. This is one of those IPA’s that you can drink one right after the other all day long. The finish was remarkably hoppy and dry. Unfortantely I forgot my growler on this trip, but I will certainly make a special trip back just to get more of this!

Brotherhood Proud Country Carrolls Mead;Washingtonville, New York, United States;Mead;Brotherhood Winery;I drank a bottle of this last night. Easily the best mead I have ever had. It has a very sweet honey aroma and taste. Be cautious when drinking this though, the alcohol is hidden so I didn’t realize how much I was consuming until it hit all at once. So be weary, cause this mead can be a dangerous friend. With that being this is easily now my favorite mead.
Brotherhood Proud Country Carrolls Mead;Washingtonville, New York, United States;Mead;Brotherhood Winery;750 ML Bollte-Clear golden pour, not much else you can say about it. Very standard mead/honey taste, really no other flavors added. Sweet, but not overly so. Very basic mead, but very good. Well done example where less is more
Brotherhood Proud Country Carrolls Mead;Washingtonville, New York, United States;Mead;Brotherhood Winery;From tap & mallet, poured from a bottle into a gay little glass. Clear light clear/yellow. Minerals and touches of urine in the nose, sour grape too. Flavors are soft, delicate...not overly sweet at all...very tasty...lots of apple and grape flavors actually...its not exactly complex or funky, but by god, it’s pretty damn good and refreshing and I really like those bright apple/grape notes...could easily use this to get my 6 year old to go to bed on command and to create a toddler alcoholic.

The aroma is honey with some fairly strong alcohol vapors, which surprises me given the abv on the bottle is listed at 8%. The flavor is straightforward honey, clean and not earthy. Sweet but not cloying. This mead is actually lighter in body than I would have imagined given its sweetness. Better than I was expecting.

Flavor is pure honey up front, a bit of citrus tang, sweet. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, light watery. Overall, I thought it was very tasty, just a simple mead with alot of flavor.

Lots of funky yeast character, yellow fruits, bananas, and overripe fruits in the aroma; quite pleasant, dense, and funky. Average carbonation. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy overripe yellow fruits, intricate yeastiness, bread, and Belgian sugars; definitely overripe, but quite generous and funky overall.

Very light MF, for such a beer; if quite slick, film-like, there’s more to this than acidthinning. MF is cruelly missing; if not, the beer might be called pretty succesfull in a Belgian way, IMO."

Ceria Pilsner;Sciacca (AG), Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ceria;swing top bottle (500ml). -Cloudy pale yellow coloured, huge airy white head, offensive and strong sourish grassy cereals nose. Acidic hoppy barnyard, boiled vegetables and pickles taste with some acidic apple finish. Simply undrinkable. The nose is awful, the taste even worse. If it weren’t from Italy, I would have thought it was spoilt.
Ceria Pilsner;Sciacca (AG), Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ceria;Fine, dry pilsener with crisp hoppiness. Similar to the best pilseners in Northern Germany. Fancy finding this at 2000 metres above sea level at Mount Etna! Long lingering piney finish.

Zwönitzer Raachermannl-Bier;Zwönitz, Saxony, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei und Gasthof Zwönitz;"Ich sage ""Vielen Dank an Kappeldav für dieses Bier""! Der Geruch ist ganz leicht rauchmalzig. Der Antrunk ist ziemlich flach mit leichter, rauchiger Note. Im Hauptteil wird das Bier etwas vollmundiger und einen ganz kleinen Tick süßlicher. Dazu mischt sich eine sehr sehr dezente Rauchmalznote zusammen mit einer angenehmen Röstmalzigkeit. Der Nachgeschmack ist eine angenehme Komposition aus angenehmer Herbe und leichten Rauchtönen, die mir aber zu sehr im Untergrund bleiben. Auf der Zunge bleibt eine angenehme, aber mir etwas zu flache Note aus Rauch, Malz und angenehmer Herbe. --> Mir ist es insgesamt zu ""flach auf der Brust"". Die Aromen könnten allesamt etwas stärker ausgeprägt sein. Aber für ein sächsisches Rauchbier doch schon ganz lecker! Test vom 11.9.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,10,11,10,12,10 - 10,45"

Darker amber coloured, small white head that went away fast, dusty smokey and caramel nose. Slight roasted malt, caramel and some smoke with flowery and mild spicy notes.

Zwönitzer Raachermannl-Bier;Zwönitz, Saxony, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei und Gasthof Zwönitz;Bottle that ogivlado got in a trade, with kappldav I guess and shared with me (thanks and thanks!). Poured a cola-like brown/black/red body with an off white head. Light smokey nose, some light soy sauce, roast, rosehip and caramel. Dryish. Light background smoke in the taste, rosehip vs. caramel mix, interesting. Nice maltiness, freshm not too hoppy. Some bacon. A very good light smoked.
Zwönitzer Raachermannl-Bier;Zwönitz, Saxony, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei und Gasthof Zwönitz;Bottled 33cl. Courtesy of kappldav123. It pours a clear nut brown beer with a small, bubbly, quick diminishing light beige head. Wort, gone-off peanuts, petrol, wormwood and a huge amount of patato and stuffy sitting room in the nose where some lovely chocolate, luscious malt, smoke and salty crackers manage to sneak in. Smells a bit like a garage. A lot of patato, marzipan and wormwood in the taste. Strange. Spicy, medium bodied and malt accented. Subtle carboantion. Low bitterness. Not much lacework. Remarkably spicy on the swallow. (Reminiscence of wormwood). Patato present again in the finish which is spicy, chocolatey and rather interesting with plenty of character. Residual sugars detectable. Good balance throughout. Different. Thanks a lot kappldav123!
Zwönitzer Raachermannl-Bier;Zwönitz, Saxony, Germany;Smoked - Rauchbier;Brauerei und Gasthof Zwönitz;Bottled. Clear mahoganycolour, brief head. Mild beechwood smoke mixes with ripe strawberries. Mid-dry with light body and clean mouthfeel. A mild pleasant smokiness prevails, not rivalled by much hops nor bitterness. Not much depth, but the smoke flavour is really pleasant.

Ambrosius Dark;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Tap at Becher-Eck in Kreuzberg. Dark brown-black body with a rocky tan-brown head. Taste has the faintest hint of ash, but this is dominated by the utterly tyrannical hammy tones of overripe fruit -- marmalade mixed with the kind of notes you only get from hot fermentation. So yes, very fruity, and very unusual for a Schwarzbier. Candyish. Watery body.
Ambrosius Dark;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Berlin beer fest. Solid mahogany with a thin head. Aroma is a little bland. Flavour is sweet, very sweet. Texture is flat and sugary.
Ambrosius Dark;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Draft at Ambrosius. Lovely very dark beer. But it is way too sweet. Loads of amlt and chocolate, leaving a sugary finish. Need to work more on this, seems their focus is very much on keeping the prices down.
Ambrosius Dark;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Draft @ brewpub. Nice black with stable head. Sweet licorice candy aroma. Thin and sweet and a bit soft. Way too sweet for me but clean. Soooo sweet!

Ambrosius Dark;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Draft. A deep red beer with a tan head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of caramel. The flavor is sweet malty - the sweetness seems a bit artificial, making the body thin. The finish is dry with a light bitterness.
Ambrosius Dark;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Meininger Privatbrauerei;"On tap. Also called both ""Schwarzbier"" and ""Dunkel"". Clear brown with an orange glow and an off-white head. Sweetish aroma of roasted malt. Medium body, fairly sweet roasted malt and a whiff of pumpernickel. Subdued bitterness. 070109"
Ambrosius Export;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Meininger Privatbrauerei;On tap. Small white head and clear yellow like a lager.

Mild caramel malty aroma with a light bitterhops flavour. Flavour is mild vegetable acidic and with a light bitterness showing through. Slight infected acidic finish yet still bitter and mild fruity. Not good.

Ambrosius Pilsener;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Tap at Becher-Eck in Kreuzberg. Pale clear yellow pour with a bright white head. Nose of gentle, citric hops, there in the mouth with some bread, oh man just super soft mouthfeel, light body and soft water accentuate the hops and the clean malt. And is it ever dry. On this evening, a juicy, near-perfect pils.
Ambrosius Pilsener;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Meininger Privatbrauerei;On tap at Ambrosius. Pale lager, malt, and grain, quite sweet. Subtle bitterness, but not enough to balance. Ends up too sweet and not at all elegant. Cheap, though.
Ambrosius Pilsener;Meiningen, Thuringia, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Meininger Privatbrauerei;Light golden with a thick head. Soft malt, doughy bread. Soft, malty, doughy...and boring.

Emerson's 1812 Anniversary Festive Brew;Dunedin, New Zealand;IPA;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Not bad but not great, i found the flavours slightly muddled and was heartily dissapointed with it considering what i’d heard
Emerson's 1812 Anniversary Festive Brew;Dunedin, New Zealand;IPA;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tasted 09/06 Inch bar Dunedin. Good rich amber in the pint. Full & weighty. Big up front hit of citrus and vanilla biscuit malts softens in the mid a bit but gives a good strong finish. Delightful
Emerson's 1812 Anniversary Festive Brew;Dunedin, New Zealand;IPA;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Yum yum yum. Without knowing what this was when I tasted it, I thought it was a strong or double IPA. Almost American in hoppy goodness. But this is English to the max, made robust by generous hop use and oak maturation (?) - just superb. Looks dark for a pale (rich amber). Tasted amazing with a lush apricot summerfruit gust as you swallow with hints of gingerbeer and late honey. Dry firm and well-balanced bitterness which is pretty smooth overall. Find it now! LOCATIONS: Tonic (on Princess St) and The Inch Bar (near the gardens). Do not delay - this’ll last a week!
Emerson's 1812 Anniversary Festive Brew;Dunedin, New Zealand;IPA;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tasted 07/09/2006. Flagon in the scorers room at the end of an enjoyable BrewNZ. Notes written from memory, a few hours later. Deep amber. Big bossy caramel and toffee malt notes jostle on the nose, with a flourish of vanilla and orangey hops. Sweet chewy malts are well-balanced by an aggresive yet smooth hop flavour and a long bitterness, which leads into a very pleasant, and drawn out, woody finish. Superb. I want to try more of this. I’d even be happy to see the end of the regular 1812, if this one replaced it.
Emerson's 1812 Anniversary Festive Brew;Dunedin, New Zealand;IPA;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Tasted twice, once via beer engine with a sparkler from a keg , then the next day from a keg co2 serve. Big vanilla notes jostle for space with citrissy hop aromas. Assertive fruity hops start the palate with a hint of dry malt , fading to a huge oaky vanilla finish. Oaky Vanila seemed diminished when served by beer engine, but hop aromas seemed extentuated. outstanding beer.
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;nice, enjoyed this beer. very good for the style blah blab blah heres your character count
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;From notes. Clear ruby. Off white carbonation. Great malt elements- toast, burnt caramel/toffee, cookie. Flavor adds some hop notes towards the finish- earthy, lightly bitter, lightly floral. Nice combo of sweet and toasty with enough bitterness and dryness to balance. Medium body is just a bit smoother than balanced. Excellent marzen.
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;"Draught at Beers in the Plaza as ""Oh! Fest!"". Amber with a big head. The aroma is pure toasty malt with a pleasing sweet-nutty quality. The flavor is rich toasty malt with a light hint of grainy sweetness before a dry finish with just a touch of hops. Not a style that I go crazy for, but this is a very nice example."
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;Beautiful dark amber pour with a hint of deeper red tones with a cream colored head. The nose was sweet from caramel malt and some apparent dark fruit, as was the flavor, with a touch of biscuit, earthiness and a medium full mouthfeel.
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;Out of the tank in the back? Thanks Craig. Reddish amber, roasted malts, hoppy, bready, little caramel, dry finish.
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;Bottle from Aspidites. Drank out of a snifter. I don’t know, maybe that was a bad move, but this stuff is not enjoyable to me at all. I’m surprised the ratings are all so high. Aroma is very vegetal, almost watermelony, and the flavor is a dank, dangerous muddy, fishy flavor that I dread going near every sip. I love a good Oktoberfest, but this just isn’t doing it for me.
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;This Marzen poured a deep yellow gold color from a fresh growler. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is caramel and malty, Medium bodied Marzen. The malts are caramel and fruity, semisweet. The hops are earth and floral, there is also a nice rye bread like spiciness here that is quite nice. Nice carbonation. Good balance. A very drinkable Marzen. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;On tap at the Schooner’s Brewery/Restaurant in Antioch. The beer poured clear copper – caramel color with light tan foam ring. There’s a mild aroma of spice, faint dark fruitiness and caramel malts. The fruitiness noted in the nose jumps out in the flavor with dates and prunes that meet up with a mild spice and beat sugar flavor mixture. There is also a diluted caramel sweetness running through along the background.
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;Courtesy boboski. Pours a nice glowing red-copper color with a broken off-white head. Aroma is a meld of sweet malt, spice, cut apples, and light hints of brown sugar. Easy palate - medium-bodied, lightly carbonated. Taste is mildly dry throughout and contrasted by varying tones of spice and hops and a hint of sweetness that provides nuance and balance. An interesting, well done brew.
Schooners Oktoberfest;Antioch, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Schooners Grille & Brewery;The pour creates a thin, light beige head that sips atop a crystal clear body of a most stunning color array: exquisite deep mahogany, ruby and deep fiery orange/brown. Beautiful, sedated. the aroma is loaded with bready German malts, just piling out of the glass. Dark malts extrapolate deep-seeded dark fruit notes from one of the most complex expressions of the style I’ve encountered. Mild hops disperse across the waves of grain. The nose is neither too sweet nor too raspy, just enticing and fresh, full of life and ambition. Alcohol is nonexistent, so are any flaws. The flavor is pleasant, mildly to moderately bitter, a perfectly integrated spice topping to dress a malt base of intricate detail. Malt is laden with toast, caramel and Viennese tradition. Sweetness is medium and delectable. The finish is malt-centric, hops fluttering about in a sweet descension to nothing but raw caramel long after the finale. The mouthfeel is very lowly and softly carbonated, a variety of which would lend to excessive and joyful Autumnal quaffing. The palate is soft even though its weightiness is substantial. Just incredible, a feat that will be hard to topple in this category. Certainly, this doesn’t adhere to any traditional stylistic guidelines, and that’s okay. This beer accellerates at pushing the envelope. When it’s all said and done, it’s still closer to a Märzen than any other style. Awesome. I would absolutely love to have access to this on a regular basis, in Autumn or otherwise.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;Aroma is bread, spices and an undercurrent of hops, while the appearance gold-orange and cloudier than most IPAs. The flavor is citrus, tea, bread and a dryish finish. I’ll give them credit for trying something different, it just didn’t work though.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;aroma is decent breadiness hidden beneath a pile of crushed asprin. appearance is murky gold with zilch head and moderate lacing. flavor is strong ginger like flavor with more fresh bread and a dose of something more rotten, hops are unable to shine through this mess. what a strange beer.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;very hazy orange pour with a thick white head. Aroma is light sweet biscuity malt with an herbal hop and green tea presence. Tea flavours feature prominently and covers up a lot of the malt sweetness at first, though some breadlike sweetness is in there somewhere. Also a light herbal hoppiness and a kind of chalky mouthfeel to the finish.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;Murky orange pour with white ring of head around the glass. Herbal, sweet aroma. Flavor isn’t as sweet: has a malty biscuity taste with light medicinal bitterness and odd herbal note. Odd yeast characteristics. KInd of flat. No real hops. This beer was like drinking some random concoction some strange relative made you to make you feel better when you’re sick.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Pours a murky peach color with no head, ugly. Aroma is oddly sweet, some biscuits and crackers. Flavor is salty... blech... spat it out.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to 17thfloor. Orange and cloudy with creamy off white head. Aroma is sweeter grain and biscuit malt with that same sand creek house smell. Flavor is light hops and medicinal with some chalk. Light and chalky body. Bleh.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;"Hazy, orange, yellow-tan color with moderate off-white head. Aroma is earthy; grass, hopps, and some sweetness. Taste is flat and somewhat bitter; hopps, malt and some citurs, possibly some ’green tea’ flavor."
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Opaque orange-tan color, foamy off white head. The aroma is strong and certainly unique, some earthy floral hops doused in a herbal green tea. Medium body, with some earthy, flowery hop character and an odd lemon-lime tea taste on top of the toasty malt. Some English IPA qualities, but pretty much a unique concoction. Doesn’t exactly work out so well, but the bottle hardly wreaks of freshness either. OK at best.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;Dead aromas, faint leafy herbal nose. Tannic bitterness that doesn’t have much malt to balance it. Bleh.
BluCreek Zen IPA;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;BluCreek Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle courtesy of Bockyhorsey - Pours a cloudy dirty blonde color with no head. Faint lacing. Aroma is toasted malt and esters. Flavor is quite odd. It does kinda taste like tea. Weird. It’s not very bitter. Not getting much of the three C’s hops. A different beer for sure. Thanks Bill.

Westons Vintage Perry;Much Marcle, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Westons Cider;500ml bottle from Dan Murphy's 7.4%abv BB 08.2020 Been many a year since I've tried a (commercial) Perry! Clear pale gold body. Good aroma - quite vinous, really ripe yellow pear, stewed fruit, touch of butter and kerosene funk. Low carbonation, full body, semi sweet, touch of acidity, has that lovely oily texture that a good Perry should. Packed full of sticky juicy ripe pear flesh and yellow skin, buttery, vinous like a Pinot Gris, reasonably sweet, slightly herbal. Really nice, so much more character than a boring old Apple cider.

The Tap Charlies Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;The Porter from The Tap is a fairly impressive offering, as it provides a very drinkable beer in a typically heavier category. It pours a dark, murky, dark chocolate color with a medium brown, fizzy head. Excellent lacing. Aroma is of sweet malts with a distinct presence of milk chocolate. Very aromatic. This, however, is where the switcharoo occurs. Initial taste is moderately bitter, with a dark chocolate, bitter taste, ramping up to a heavy bitter finish with sour notes and a long duration. Lightly carbonated, it is medium bodied, but light for the style. It is creamy, but creamy in the way that skim milk is creamy. Moreso than water, but clearly not whole milk, which make this a very drinkable porter. Reviewed on January 9th, 2007
The Tap Charlies Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;on tap-pours a thick creamy brown head and black color. Aroma is coffee-dark malt. Taste is coffee-dark malt, then hops bitterness, acidic.
The Tap Charlies Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Typical porter brown black with a slight head. Aroma of coffee, and uh-oh, broccoli hops. Yeast and green hop flavor. Yuck! The hops probably really aren’t all that pronounced here, but unfortunately this happens to be a varietal that I apparently despise. Run across this flavor before, not my bag at all. Thanks to Maniac for the opportunity to sample at the 4th Richmond Gathering, growler. This beer isn’t nearly as bad as my rating indicates, it unfortunately hit a flavor profile I can’t stand.
The Tap Charlies Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Thanks to Maniac for his unfailing searching for more ratings for me! This aroma definitely had a bit of an odeur of sour milk, also lots of chocolate malt and coffee. Opaque brown body, you know how we do, playa. The flavour is mostly coffee.
The Tap Charlies Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Growler, from The Tap. Dark black body with a small creamy brown head. Sweet roasted malt and chocolate aroma. Dark chocolate flavor with some strong bitter, and some sweet coffee flavor.
The Tap Charlies Porter;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Porter;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Draught pint at Redbones on 9/8/06. Very dark, nearly-opaque black/brown body has a light-tan head perched atop it. Very well-retained and lacing quite profusely. Buckets of chocolate malt are manifested in the nose, which has a good deal of roasted bitterness. Some nuts, soy, a hint of vanilla bean and molasses, it all makes for quite a complex aroma. The base malt sweetness, however, is full and thick, allowing for the roasty/ashy/acrid notes to take their aggression out on the sweet malts and not on your nose. Hop apparency is very low, maybe a touch of leafiness thrown in for good measure, but it’s difficult to discern amidst the malts, which this beer certainly focuses on. No alcohol in the nose. Medium-high to high strength of aroma. Where the nose has the benefit of clearing itself in the smoke-free air of Redbones, the palate is not so fortunate. Though it begins strongly enough, by the end of the glass, the palate is near beat-to-death by the huge tar-like roastiness that hangs on the finish. The chewy, thick, fudge-like-consistency of the malts certainly helps balance this sensation, and the carbonation is appropriate, delivering a lightly brisk wave of respite, but in the end, the bitterness just builds too heavily (for me anyways). Still, it’s wonderfully brewed and probably wouldnt bother most dark-beer lovers. The lack of hop flavor certainly goes a long way as well towards helping keep balance. Some notes of hazelnut, vanilla, chocolate graham crackers and creamy vanilla all help add complexity. Tone down the malt bitterness (near astringency) about 33% and this would be world-class stuff. Lovely texture, unfiltered and all. No alcohol apparent in flavor.
Boundary Bay Single Hop - Palisade;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boundary Bay Brewery;Very interesting use of a single hop. Obviously not too complex, the ale becomes a very malty body. Almost sweet.
Boundary Bay Single Hop - Palisade;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boundary Bay Brewery;Hazy amber, with a thin soapy head. Aroma is lightly piney soapy hoppiness, honey, and light caramel. Taste is piney, floral with a light hoppiness and some honey.

McMenamins Destruction Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;This was actually a really well built porter. Dark bitter chocolate start, slightly burnt taste to it, soft licorice note, and a bit of coffee in the finish. Lighter palate, a touch watery, but a good sessionable porter. A touch more carbonation would have brought out more coffee in the finish and might have made the palate less watery, but I’d order this again anytime.
McMenamins Destruction Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Very solid Porter here. Lots of chocolate flavor just as advertised. Lots of burnt malt flavors but not to much acidity. Full , smooth mouthfeel.
McMenamins Desolation Blvd Pale Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Pretty hearty pale ale here. Lots of earthy flavors in this one.

Shato Slavutych Platinove;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Shato / Chateau Brewery (Slavutych);Draught. This was very similar to the Zolte. I liked it a little more but not much. Seems odd ot offer two nearly identical beers.
Shato Slavutych Platinove;Kyiv, Ukraine;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivovarnya Shato / Chateau Brewery (Slavutych);Small white head over hazy yellow body with ongoing carbonation. Faintly grassy rubbery aroma. Taste is grassy hops, primarily, followed by a mealy, papery, rubbery aftertaste. Some spice as well. Some bitterness, though not that much. More hops than the zolote, which again helps. (0.3l on tap.)
Rock Bottom Yorktown Belgian Wit;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Imperial pint poured on tap at the brewpub (Lombard, Il). Pours a yellow straw murky pour, typical glowing wheat, light head that clings a little. Aromas are very light, typical wheat cereal qualities and very light orange rind in the nose. Subtle flavord in the initial, cereal wheat without the wheaty bitterness, light orange peel and ester, not much coriander. Nice and sessionable, but a little underdone. Decent.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Belgian Wit;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Hefty clouds within and slight whites above hang in lacing sheets over a lemon-yellow body. Lagered lemon nose with banana annotation. Thick and wheaty with a strong alcohol detraction. Banana flavor dominant with a strong grapefruit finish that is too brash to compare to the Hoegaarden Wit that the bartender compared this to. On tap at Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL 60148
Rock Bottom Yorktown Belgian Wit;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Mug Club draft. More of a nice, cloudy orange than the nearly white I’ve found with other draft wits. A nice clean wheat beer smell with threads of orange zest. Problem is they served me a glass that they had in an ice cooler, so it was served too cold. I lost any complexity the beer might have had, but did enjoy it as a nice, light wheaty beer with that orange again, and perhaps some grains of paradise. As the beer warmed up toward the end, I also got a bit of lemon to it, too.
Rock Bottom Cincinnati The Dominator IPA;Cincinnati, Ohio, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Cincinnati;Draft from cask. Poured hazy copper color with an average rocky off-white head that was mostly lasting with fair lacing. Moderate floral and sour citrus hoppy aroma. Medium body with a slick texture. Heavy bitter flavor with a medium smooth bitter finish of long duration. I would recommend this to a freind.

Fantôme Saint-Roch;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Another entry from notes. Bottle traded for and shared at Fantomefest 2014. Cloudy sunglow yellow in color with some soapy head around the edges of the glass. Nose and flavor are closely interwined. There is a lot of soft peach/stone fruit tartness that finishes with a fair amount of earthy, dank funk. Medium mouthfeel despite it’s rather delicate flavor with good carbonation and a pleasant, enduring finish. One of the shining stars of the tasting, a real treat to drink.
Fantôme Saint-Roch;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;750ml bottle from Kamiel. Clear dark orange with an off white head. Quite tart, slightly alcoholic, lemon, grain, apricot, bit bretty and orange, tang. Mild carbonation, moderate body, tang and interesting, dry, apricot and orange. Good.
Fantôme Saint-Roch;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Don’t know how to describe this, it’s kind of a saison, with a sour body. Reminds me of a tardy wine as well. Weird, but very good.
Fantôme Saint-Roch;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Bomber. Thanks to Takahara for this. Sharp and immediate stink: sewer and sauerkraut, sour grass, with a tiny sweetness in the background. Cloudy light copper color. Big puckering initial: sour pears and fermented cabbage / sour fruit continues, and apple and apricot notes emerge, some leather, too. / finish has trickling sourness, which fades out like fog in the morning sunshine. Lovely.
Fantôme Saint-Roch;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;8% cloudy honey gold pour, sour, barrel-aged woodsy & sour aroma. Very sour & sweet, tasty stuff.
Fantôme Saint-Roch;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;"Starts as a clear orange amber; after pouring the yeast fond it becomes darker, unclear and rather beige, inbetween amber and brown. Quite a bit of visible carbonation. The nose is mildly sour with some fruity touches, a bit vinous. The taste starts out mostly sour but in a pleasant way, almost hinting of geuze-like sourness but with more punch to it and fewer earthy notes (and with carbonation on the tongue) and a balanced dose of spices, decent bit of hop bitterness as well. It feels more alcoholic than most other Fantômes, though this might be because of the yeast having transformed any residual sugars. Once you get to the yeasty bottom, there’s less sourness and it shifts from a saison to a typical amber, still well-balanced but more present spices, now a solid dose of alcohol. An excellent apéritif, less easily drinkable and somewhat stranger in balance than your typical Fantôme saison but in return it packs more power."
Fantôme Saint-Roch;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;"Bottle shared at CBC Clerkenwell, London during the Birthday Celebration of Jack & Leighton - many thanks to Paul for supplying the Fantome; it’s just not a real party until the Fantome starts a pourin’. Pours cloudy, orange-gold with a fine, fading white head. Tangy orange citrus aroma with sugary, pale bread. Big sweet falvor with further notes of lightly tangy citrus, and mild orange peel bitterness. Full bodied with fine, spritzy carbonation. Lightly warming to finish with moderate dry citrus fruits, some dough, sugar, faint yeast. Decent. Very drinkable for the ABV."

Heavily hazed golden orange with wee floaters to keep me company. Nose is tarte fruits, sour tones, lemon rind, light sugar, bitter orange, sour peaches, farmyard. Taste comprises a good level of funk, soured fleshy fruits, burnt notes, lemon rind, spice. Medium bodied with bite, fine carbonation, dry in the finish. Nice stuff!
Fantôme Saint-Roch;Soy-Erezée, Belgium;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brasserie Fantôme;Bottle. Cheers to monsieur Scopey for supplying this. This apparently had been aged a few years. The pour’s hazy amber with a small head. The aroma’s tart underripe melon, some lemon and peaches. Light farmhouse funk. The taste is tart apple cider. A bit of lactic acid. Mild warhead candy acidity. Wheaty funk. Light body. Fine carbonation. Overall, this seems to have developed some interesting flavors. Nice.

Beerlao Dark;Vientiane, Laos;Dark Lager - Premium;Lao Brewery Co (Carlsberg);Oct 2019 - bottle at Arno's in Sathorn, Bangkok. This is an American beef burger joint, but they serve some hard to find beers, and do salads so I can eat here. Lager is very watery with little flavour - I suspect the colour is due to caramel rather than roasted barley. Whatever it's an ok drink.

Apollo Praga;Copenhagen, Denmark;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Bryggeriet Apollo;A brown beer with a red shine under a brown head. The aroma is sweet with notes of licorice, malt, and caramel - nicely inviting. The flavor starts out sweet with strong notes of licorice and caramel, but with a note of butter lying in the back ground - brewing flaw? After detecting the butter in the flavor it is also evident in the aroma. The end is slightly roasted. The mouthfeel is too carbonated. Some good and some bad notes.

Pisgah IPA;Black Mountain, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Pisgah Brewing Company;Found in can from Franklin, NC Ingles. Just a well put together beer with a great flavor throughout. Really a go to fall IPA for me.
Pisgah IPA;Black Mountain, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Pisgah Brewing Company;Deep golden color with a taller, stable ecru head. Scents of earthy malt, and mild citrus. Flavors concur with the scents as the earthiness is present throughout, both in the malts and hops. Earthy and mediocre 3/10
Pisgah IPA;Black Mountain, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Pisgah Brewing Company;(From notes). Consumed at the May 2011 LEAF Festival, about 1 mile from the brewery. A - Amber. Clear. Nice bone head is creamy and has very good retention. S - modestly hoppy aroma for style, with toasted malt T - fairly rich and earthy, with plenty of toasted malt and hop bitterness. As expected, this IPA has a bitter finish and lingering bitter grapefruit rind aftertaste, but I thought this one had too little actual hop flavor given this level of bitterness. M - medium body is a bit full for style. Adequate if light carbonation. O- Good beer, and certified organic, but disappointing given the outstanding track record of this brewery.
Pisgah IPA;Black Mountain, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Pisgah Brewing Company;Old rating. Decent IPA. More biscuity than hoppy. Mild floral hops. Easy drinking, but fairly basic stuff.

Korrigane Myrtille Bleuet;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Korrigane - Brasserie Artisanale;My Bottom Line: Timid sweet fruitiness and base malts level out the intrinsic fruit tartness in this softspoken, but rather generic Fruit Beer. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the clear rosy red. -The chosen malts don’t really fit with the blueberry fruitiness. -The malts’s sweetness is cleanly extracted, but I just don’t think this is a great recipe. -Some wooden hop bitterness dries out the back end. -The fruitiness could be more expressive/juicier. On tap at the brewpub.
Korrigane Myrtille Bleuet;Québec, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Korrigane - Brasserie Artisanale;OCntains a good appearance like reddish. NOt too much flavour. The aroma is like soft malts and good foam.

Black Forest Smoked Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Black Forest Brew Haus;Pours a medium to dark brown with a faint off white head. Heavy notes of smoke, wood, caramel and chocolate. The Flavor is slightly metallic and the palate is a little watery. Heavily smoked but lacking in body.
Black Forest Smoked Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Black Forest Brew Haus;It really pains me to give this such a low rating as Black Forest is usually very on point with its offering. A careful look at my scores, however will reveal that this beer only really fails on a specific point. The aroma is nice a smoky with a bit of malt. The flavor follows in kind except for a strange chemical taste right before the smoke. I can best describe it as camomeal tea (which I also dislike intensely).
Black Forest Smoked Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Black Forest Brew Haus;one of my favorites out of BF. this beer has an incredible smoked flavor and wish they had it back on the menu.
Black Forest Smoked Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Black Forest Brew Haus;On tap at the brewpub. Pours black with a thick tan head. Aroma of smoked and roasted malt (not very meaty though). Flavor of smoke, sweet malt, charred malt. Pretty good smoked beer, easy drinking. It grew on me as I continued to drink and I was really enjoying it by the end of the glass. 7/4/7/4/14 [3.6/5]
Black Forest Smoked Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Black Forest Brew Haus;Aroma is smoky, earthy, malty. The appearance is deep brown, opaque, minimal tan head. The flavor is smoky, peat, earth, light chocolate. The finish is smoke, pine hops. The mouthfeel is oliy, medium to medium/thick body. Good. This is a growler from the brewpub, I suspect it’s a little flat from an improper sealing.
Black Forest Smoked Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at the brewpub: Deep dark brown with a ruby highlight to it, topped by a creamy tan head. Roasted aroma- fairly simple with some earthy peat/soil like notes and roated malt. There’s a hint of woody smokiness in there. Decent body, relatively light. The Flavor incorporates smoke and earthy bitterness. A bit gritty and earthy. Quite a roasted bitterness, near ashy-ness is present throughout, with bitter tobacco and peat. The smoke is there but leans toward ashy bitterness. The finish is long earthy and bitter. It is a bit smoky, but in the form of ash. Not much depth.
Black Forest Smoked Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Black Forest Brew Haus;on tap at the brewpub. Just about black in color with a tan head. Aroma of smoke, roast, mild chocolate, molasses and chalk. Taste is nice and smoky, with some roast, chocolate- medium mildly sweet body with molasses. Finishes with lingering smoke and a touch of bitterness. Very nice!
Black Forest Smoked Porter;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Porter - Smoked;Black Forest Brew Haus;Damn brandon, I thoroughly enjoyed this puppy, but i love smoked beer. Big wide mug at the brewpub on their Octoberfest. Color is black with some brown tinges. Small tan head turns into lacing. Aroma is mild though, faint smoke and not much else. Dont try it for the aroma. Taste is what makes it. Actually smokey, something different for smoked porters. Just a tad of bitterness. Leaves a nice present smokey aftertaste. Just a bit of bitterness and a sllight sweetness thoughout.

Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);This beer raises a very tall white head which slowly settles as I drink. A nice cap of foam hangs till the last sip and makes for some slick lacy finger patterns on the glass. Its body has a somewhat tan, sandy amber color which is quite murky. The aroma is yeasty and estery with tons of wheat and some hints of its 8% abv. I also pick also pick up on some hops in the background that add a light earthy/spicy/floral character. Its medium to full body has a big yeasty and malty character with notes of banana baby food, unripe peach, pear, mellow phenolic clove and sweet wheat. Towards the finish there is more grainy wheat and light hints of hops and mildly spicy alcohol. The palate feels heavy, smooth and slick with mild carbonation.
Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Old tick. This one was very banana like and sweet, not sure when or why it was discontinued.
Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle at O’Connors, Uppsala. Hazy orange color, very little white head - was completely clear before the yeast was poured from the bottle. Cloyingly sweet aroma with overripe fruit, syrup and berries. Taste is sweet and spicy with berries and toffee combining in a way that is similar with some barley wines. Very full body, sticky texture and a flat carbonation. This was a really interesting, complex beer - didn’t detect much wheat in the taste or aroma, though.
Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);65 cl bottle. Originally rated on 20100417. Pours hazy golden color with a small head. Aroma of wheat, hops, ripe fruits and some grass. Flavor of hay, toffee, hops, ripe fruits and wheat.
Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);"65 cl bottle @ O’Hara’s Freehouse. Rated on 17.04.2010 Rather unusual appearance; after the pour I can see the yeast falling towards the bottom of my glass. Aroma is somewhat sweet banana esthers, yeasty notes, fruits and hints of alcohol. Flavour is sweetish with wheaty notes, fruits, banana esthers and yeast. Finishes with somewhat stinging alcohol. Good still."
Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);"22 ounce bottle into weizen glass, no bottle dating but this has been retired for a couple years at least. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a fairly dense 1-2 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing on the glass. Aromas of big banana, lemon, pear, wheat, caramel, honey, clove, bread, orange, pepper, bubblegum, earth, and yeast spices. Pretty nice aromas with good strength and decent balance; the age is definitely apparent. Taste of banana, orange, clove, pear, wheat, biscuit, caramel, lemon, pepper, honey, earth, toffee, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of banana, light fruits, wheat, biscuit, clove, caramel, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; good fruity/spicy flavor balance; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick and creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial hefeweizen. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to drink for an 8% beer. Very enjoyable offering, despite the noticeable age."
Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle. 22 oz. Pours a deep, brilliant yellow with a pristine, tightly bubbled white head.

Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Bottle at Dan’s, pour courtesy of Aaron. Thanks! This bottle is probably 2-3 years old, so my rating would probably change if this was fresh. Anyways, poured a hazy orange with little-to-no head. Aroma is very musty, dead malt, fungused bread, and some metal, IDK, haha. Taste is old, liquid bread, stale wheat, and just not very appetizing. Thin body and overall the taste is just expired. Bleh.
Southern Tier Heavy Weizen;Lakewood, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Pour out of 22 oz bottle, slightly orange with white head, aroma has notes of wet grain, some slight vanilla, touch of biscuit, bread and mineral water, lots of cardboard as well. Taste is cardboard, vanilla, some dusty mineral, some slight off taste hints of bread, finishing fairly sweet. Definitely past its prime.
Big Horse Moped Rider English IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Big Horse Brewing;Growler, first pour. Deposits in glass a clear, medium amber color. Nice whitish head forms and retains for a good bit, leaving decent lacing as the beer is consumed. Medium bodied with fairly soft carbonation. Herbal and grassy nose, slight bits of toast in aroma. Flavors seem to be malt dominant towards the front with biscuit and then a pleasant, slow bitterness towards the finish that balances out nicely and lingers. Quite solid, easy to drink English IPA

Ringneck Bourbon Barrel Aged Poor Richards Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The Brew Kettle;Wax-sealed bottle: The beer is a murky brown-amber color with a medium thick and rocky light beige head. Sticky patches of lacing mostly near the top of the glass. Strong aroma of molasses, malt and coconut. Rich and very smooth-bodied. The barrel-aging definitely imbues the original version with a pronounced bourbon flavor. Woody, malty flavors along with hops and peppery alcohol. The finish is round and sweet, with a lingering bourbon aftertaste. Very good overall.
Ringneck Bourbon Barrel Aged Poor Richards Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The Brew Kettle;GABF 2006: Clear light amber color with an off-white head. Some vanilla but light on the barrel. The flavor was woody and malty. Bitter finish with a light to medium body.
Ringneck Bourbon Barrel Aged Poor Richards Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The Brew Kettle;"Draft... GABF ’06... Mostly clear golden ale with a small, tight, white head. Decent retention. Toffee, brown sugar, subtle wood and bourbon in the nose. Pretty hot, flavor-wise. Big, chewy caramel, heavy bitterness and alcohol. Good balance; minimal sweetness. Medium-bodied and lightly creamy with fizzy carbonation. Finishes caramely sweet, then astringent and dry."

Pours out a dark brown color with a small tan head.Aroma is very malty with nice hints of bourbon. Flavor was superb. Very malty with huge hints of vanilla and bourbon. This is the first bourbon aged scotch ale i have had and its great.
Ringneck Bourbon Barrel Aged Poor Richards Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The Brew Kettle;Bottle from Matt (drbayern) Thanks! This is one hell of a good scotch ale. Pour is black in color with some nice head retention. Smell is oak, vanilla, some hops, sweet caramel, and a touch of bourbon. Taste is smooth and rich, with some roasted malts coming through to kind of balance the barrel aging process. I am typically not a fan of the barrel aged beers, but this one certainly does it justice. Very nice!
Ringneck Bourbon Barrel Aged Poor Richards Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The Brew Kettle;Draught sample at the brewpub, early August 2006. An opaque dirty, very much unfiltered yeasty brown body with a lasting creamy head and a lot of lace....sweet, rustic and smoky aroma, touches of molasses along with the bourbony vanilla tones, faint spices flitting in and out and hard to grasp....molasses strongly evident in the body, corn grits seem to be a major component in the malts and are well-complimented by the booze, with faint peaty caramelized barley sitting lightly underneath...thick and near-cloying but fascinating. Scotch ale? I dunno, but it’s a neat experiment anyway.
Ringneck Bourbon Barrel Aged Poor Richards Ale;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;The Brew Kettle;Stunning ale, the best barrel aged beer I’ve ever had. Had it at the restaurant on tap the last week of August. Smells full of bourbon, brown sugar. Looks thick, dark brown, doesn’t appear to be filtered. Taste is amazing -- sweet malt balanced by dry bourbon, medium thick body that tricks you into thinking you’re actually sipping a bourbon, so you drink it slow. The finish is dry, which is a great change, since all barrel aged beers I’ve had are sweet imperial stouts. Note from Chris, the brewmaster: They were one of 100 breweries making an old American recipie from Ben Franklin or something like that. All they had was a list of ingredients, no proportions. He says the base beer is a Scotch ale. He used 25% corn in this beer, as corn was one of the ingredients on the list. He plans on taking it to GABF, but made only 55 gallons of it, so when you find it, snatch it up.
Bellwether Spyglass Hard Cider;Trumansburg, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Bellwether Hard Cider;Pours pale copper. Smells of sweet apples, some honey hints in the backdrop. Tastes sweet and syrupy with some spicy hints on the finish.
Bellwether Spyglass Hard Cider;Trumansburg, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Bellwether Hard Cider;Bottle. Pours a clear yellow, no head. Big sweet apples, candy apple aromas. Quite sweet, a touch vegetal and funky. Weird, overly sweet and plasticy. Bleh. Lingering sugar on the finish. Nothing great.

Hereford & Hops Blackbird Stout;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Keg at the brewpub. Dark brown, thin creamy tan head, fair retention. Aroma of pure diacetyl and a hint of roast. Taste is diacetyl, dms, roast, caramel. Thin. A mess.
Hereford & Hops Blackbird Stout;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was an almost black color with a finger’s worth of eggshell white foamy head that dissipated at a slow pace. Mild lace. The aroma had some roasted coffee notes, light oatmeal, light dark chocolate nibs and ends with some cereal/grainy sweetness. The flavor leans to the sweet side and rolls into a smooth sort of oat/grainy aftertaste and on into the finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionable to sipping sort of quality about it. Roastiness was smoothed out fairly nice by the oatmeal. Overall, nicely done oatmeal stout well worthy of having again.
Hereford & Hops Blackbird Stout;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;4 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Consumed on 4-23-16. Dark brown. Beige head. Pretty good lacing. Coffee and burnt caramel scents. Coffee flavor. Dry, verging on caramel. Basic stout flavor. Not bad but nothing special in taste. Light body. Unremarkable palate.

Hereford & Hops Blackbird Stout;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;"On tap at the Escanaba Brewpub as the ""Blackbird Oatmeal Stout."" Pours a deep mahogany, fringe in brown. Head is an off-white. Light nutty aroma. Wow. This is terrible. A totally watered down, flavorless, lightly roasted garbage stout. A bit of salt, tannin and not much else. Minerals and water. Very little body. This is just plain a terrible stout. I can’t tease anything worth anything out of this. Faintly roasty with a bit of chocolate powder. But this is an embarrassment of a stout."
Hereford & Hops Blackbird Stout;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;A very sub par sweet stout. Aroma was near nothing. Pour was a flat deep brown with no head. Taste was very weak and boring. A slight coffee flavor with water overpowering. Just a little bit of bitterness in the aftertaste that reminds you that you are drinking beer. Very flat and thin mouthfeel. Blah.
Hereford & Hops Blackbird Stout;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;"Typical H&H background beer aroma, you know, just plain good ol beery. Just a hint of stout smell. Black with a red tinge. Nice tasting stout, it has more carbonation than I expected and I welcome that. Good roasty flavors; fun, fresh and friendly. Much better than I expected, pleasantly surprised! May be my best H&H to date!"
Hereford & Hops Blackbird Stout;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On draught at the brewpub/restaurant in Wausau, Wisconsin. Pours a clear dark cola brown brew with a thick and lumpy light tan head that has some excellent retention and sticky lacing. Aroma of toasted dark malt, a near schwarzbier character, some flowery hops and a touch of chocolate. Taste is smooth, creamy, quite malty with a toasted malt and chocolate flavor with a touch of molasses in the near finish. Finish is sweet at first and then a lingering semi-dry aftertaste with flavor of toasted dark malt. Quite enjoyable.
Heartland Imperial IPA;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Greenpoint Beer Works;On tap in the city. Drinkable IPA that doesn’t go beyond the basics. Nothing special. But there aren’t other brewpubs in the area.
Heartland Imperial IPA;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Greenpoint Beer Works;Tap at the Empire State location. Pale golden/crystal clear with a sticky white head. Aroma of fruity orange and mango with a touch of pine as well. Lean, clean pale malt with a light bready accent. Flavour is nicely hoppy, more IPA than double but it shows orange citrus, pine and a light resinousness. As it warms a bright spicy flavour comes through on the finish. Not a big massively hopped IIPA, but it’s still a nice pint.
Heartland Imperial IPA;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Greenpoint Beer Works;7.7% on this one. Deeply hazed rust, light tan creamy head. Nose held notes of pine and citrus, hints of florals, and just a touch of sweet caramel malt. Soft bitter flavors throughout with lighter shades of nutty earth. Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, soft bitter finish. More like a Light Imperial IPA in my book...
Heartland Imperial IPA;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Greenpoint Beer Works;Pours copper with a thick off white head. Aroma was malty with hints of orange, citrus, graitfruit, pine and caramel. The graitfruit was over hinted in the aroma and taste. Pretty average for a Double IPA. Of course I am being picky because I love this style.
Heartland Imperial IPA;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Greenpoint Beer Works;Pint glass at 51st and 6th ave. Couldnt really piick up any aroma (probably my allergies). Nice, copper color with fine head. I was expecting monster hops, and while this has a dominant hop presence, it wasn’t overwhelming. Very creamy feel to it - the malt backs it up nicely. Noticed hints of nut and vanilla. Lacing follows the beer down. Hop flavor intensifies as you drink. Alcohol also more noticeable too toward the end. A good beer, not sure how it holds up to other Imperial IPAs.
Heartland Imperial IPA;Brooklyn, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Greenpoint Beer Works;A pretty big beer. Very malty, somewhat boozy. Good esters, orange peel, caramel, moderately sweet, medium-heavy bittering. Mouthy. I was talking business with a collegue and didn’t get real good notes, but my genera limpression was that this was a fairly substantial brew with a kick, but on the beaten path.
Northern Rivers Stout;Russellton Industrial Area, NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Northern Rivers Brewing;Unbalance overflow on the head. All over the floor. Dark and murky and chocolaty. Quite nice but somehow a little on the amateur side but very drinkable and a good effort.
Northern Rivers Stout;Russellton Industrial Area, NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Northern Rivers Brewing;"Bottle. Just had an ’old engine oil’ which was fantastic; might influence ratings here. No real head, dense black, quite sour smelling. International roast coffee, a little thin, i’m not getting that ’creamy mouthfeel’. Smokey like smoke essence in canned tuna. Northern rivers beers seem to taste like adequately made concentrate kit home brew - inoffensive, unimaginative."

Northern Rivers Stout;Russellton Industrial Area, NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Northern Rivers Brewing;Pours a dark brown and tanned head. Roasted malt with chocolate and coffee notes. Flavour is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and licorice. Medium bodied, creamy and slight bitter finish.
Northern Rivers Stout;Russellton Industrial Area, NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Northern Rivers Brewing;This is not a bad beer by any means, but it really didn’t live up to what I was hoping it to be. The head didn’t last as well as I expect and it tended towards being a bit too roasty (almost felt like charcoal). Overall though I wouldn’t knock it back if you bought the next round.
Northern Rivers Stout;Russellton Industrial Area, NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Northern Rivers Brewing;Poured a black body with a short lasting, light tan head. Dark chocolate on the aroma also a bit of smokiness. Coffee notes more so than the chocolate and the smoke in the taste, drinkable but not outstanding for me.
Northern Rivers Stout;Russellton Industrial Area, NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Northern Rivers Brewing;"RE-RATE: Bottle (330ml). Poured black with a large, dense, rocky, light-brown head which lasted superbly. Aroma was of dark toasted malts with dark chocolate, espresso coffee, licorice and some salt. Flavor was similar to aroma but well balanced; toasted malts, dark chocolate, a moderate bitterness, milky espresso coffee and some licorice in the finish. Medium bodied with lively carbonation a dry/creamy mouthfeel and a good finish."
Northern Rivers Stout;Russellton Industrial Area, NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Northern Rivers Brewing;hey, a decent english sort of stout. quite solid black looking, with a loose head and too much carb. coffee pralines in nose. salty, licorice and coffee flavour - guinness yeast? good spicy hops on finish, not that bitter but a bit of goldingsy pepper to finish off. fairly strong roast barley character but in a nice fresh toasty/bitter way rather than a pinched tinny way. reminds me of a few of my more unambitious HB stouts - drinkable, simple, good balance of roast, acidity and sweetness.
Northern Rivers Stout;Russellton Industrial Area, NSW, Australia;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Northern Rivers Brewing;Bitter malt chocolate aroma. Dark borwn coca cola colour with fair head and alcing. Malt chocolate sweet flavour. Fizzy palate.
Tinkoff Bezalkogolnoe Filtrovannoe;St. Petersburg, Russia;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Tinkoff;Medium creamy lasting head over clear yellow body with carbonation. Sweet faintly grainy malt aroma with notes of caramel and straw. Taste is sweet straw with grassy hop notes, and the signature Tinkoff papery rubber aftertaste. Not bad, but I’d prefer to do without the aftertaste. (0.3l on tap in the Moscow brewpub.)

Dieu du Ciel! Retour aux Racines;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;On tap at DDC 15th anniversary. Muddy amber brown pour. Aroma is slightly earthy, ginger, rootbeer, with lots of toffee. Tastes more like rootbeer soda than it smells like. Malty, nice rootbeer flavor. Palate is a tad thin and undercarbed. Interesting little beer.
Dieu du Ciel! Retour aux Racines;Montréal, Quebec, Canada;Flavored - Other;Brasserie Dieu du Ciel!;Not bad for what it is. Pours cloudy brown with good head and lacing. Some sweet root taste, while still balancing out with the beer side of the affair. Finishes with light sweetness and malty residue on palate. Tap at brewpub.
Durdin Kvas;Moscow, Russia;Kvass;Durdin;No head whatsoever. Dark brown, almost black, opaque body. Sweetish, gingery aroma with roasty notes of dark rye bread, with maybe a touch of cinnamon and caramel. Taste is watery ginger and mild roasty bread. No aftertaste. Soft and silky mouthfeel. Harmonic. Reminiscent of traditional Norwegian homebrew like my grandfather made, but of higher quality. Very nice, if not earthshattering. (0.3l, but whether from draft or bottle is not clear.)
Sixteen Tons Krasnoe Osoboe;Moscow, Russia;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Sixteen Tons;Tap at the brewery restaurant. Aroma red fruits, caramel, malty. Hazy deep red colour.

Fugelestou Marsh Mild;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Fulstow;Bottle conditioned from Asda, I think. Cloudy red black, big fluffy beige head, insistent condition. Fruity tart aromas with hints of earthy chocolate, dry bitter yeast and chocolate in the mouth with a much subdued fruitiness lurking at the back, gentle lingering dry bitterness in the finish.
Fugelestou Marsh Mild;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Fulstow;Cask at The London Drinker Festival 2009. Very dark brown with a small froth. Tart berries aroma. Berries flavours blend with slightly dry roast. Light-bodied as appropriate. Old-fashioned mild.

Hazy, dark brown colour, fine light brown head, good lace. Sweetish, sourish and bitter. Unbalanced complexity of fruits, chocolate, laurel and old tea. Quite watery.
Fugelestou Marsh Mild;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Fulstow;Angry fist of Santa tasting at Chris_o’s. Very deep chestnut/ruby with thin beige head. Hey it’s a mild gueze. Some mild choc flavours. It they intended it, it would be brilliant, sweetness from the malts. Very drinkable. Yes it’s infected, but lovely. Interesting.
Fugelestou Marsh Mild;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Fulstow;"A Mes rate: bottle at Chris_O’s ""Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf / Hog Fest"" tasting. Mid amber with a thin off white head. Earty aroma with a slight sourness. Lemon acidity with a clear lambic like feel thanks to an obvious infection. It’s odd, clearly wrong and I can’t help liking it. Think of a Flemish mild and you are pretty much there. Slight sweetness from the malt puts it quite close to a Duchesse. I’m in two minds here. This is clearly not drinking as the brewer intended it and I know it’s wrong. But I quite like it. So I’m rating it as such. Who cares?"
Fugelestou Marsh Mild;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Fulstow;Bottle at chris_o’s cowboy with beasts of a wolfish nature rather than the normal wilderbeast banter. Alround rating: Tart soft brown malts, sour infected beer, but still of relitive drinkability.
Fugelestou Marsh Mild;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Fulstow;Bottle @ Chris_o’s Pre-Beer Exposed Tasting, September 2008. Pours deep nutty brown with a good, creamy, off-white head. Aroma is light raisins, malty and sour grapes. Okay mouthfeel. Flavour is sour and infected. Somehow drinkable anyways (?).
Fugelestou Marsh Mild;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Fulstow;Bottle Conditioned. Pours a dark brown colour with a light brown head.A real biscuit aroma,Plenty of dark malts in the tsaste with a hint of toffee, with a dry malty chocolate finish. A good well balanced beer.
Fugelestou Marsh Mild;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Mild Ale;Fulstow;Cask Handpump at the Community Centre, Tarporley 26/01/2007 Some roast aroma. Thick white head. Dark and smooth on the palate with a bitter chocolaty malt finish.
Fugelestou Pride Of Fulstow;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Tried at the Gas Lamp Loungr, Louth. Amber colour with a white head. Soft fruity aroma with malty caramel. Taste light bittersweet to light sweet. Very refreshing.
Fugelestou Pride Of Fulstow;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Gravity poured half-pint at a mini-beer festival in ’The Malcolm Arms’, in the Lincolnshire village of Anton’s Gowt (I kid you not). Deep amber body with a full but swiftly departing white head of bubbles. Malty yet with a very dry finish: the smell was fruity, dark berry type fruits. The taste also dark fruits with some semi-sweetness before the dry finish kicked in. No hop presence detectable until the finish: I found it a strange but not unpleasant brew.
Fugelestou Pride Of Fulstow;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;[Cask at the Bacchus Hotel, Sutton-on-Sea] Amber with a thick white head. Rich & fruity at first, but by the end it becomes herby and a little sour, with a moderate dirty bitterness. Not great.
Fugelestou Pride Of Fulstow;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Cask at Green Man, Stamford, Lincolnshire. Amber with a small white head. Grainy Ovaltine and breakfast cereal aroma. That’s not bad, but it’s the taste I don’t like. It’s rounded, leathery malt with a rather oppressive milky Horlicks taste. Some bitterness. The theme here is obviously proprietory bedtime drinks, and it clearly doesn’t work for me.
Fugelestou Pride Of Fulstow;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Cask conditioned at Harbury Beer Fest ’09. Brown amber with no head. In a festival of great beer this was the stinker, there was a fusty, mouldy taste to it, tart and I poured it after a short while. yeeuk.
Fugelestou Pride Of Fulstow;Louth, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fulstow;Bottle conditoned. Poured a mild brown colour with a medium white head. The beer has a real fruit aroma with a real taste that was very fruity with a hint of pears. The beer has a bitter hoppy aftertaste.
Baptiste de Br. Bataille;Rebecq-Quenast, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie Lefebvre;"Draught Orange-amber-gold with a very persistent, just off-white head. Served way too cold. Malty, with a touch of seaweed (iodium?), mild-sweet. Oppressive malts taste, grainy, very toasted & almondy. Some garden herb flavours, like aniseed. Medium bodied, mild alcoholburn. Another Lefebvre labelbeer; probably Bonne Esperance."
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Tallboy can. Clear golden color with bubbles. Dusty pear aroma. Taste is sweet sweet pear. Perfect for Americans who want pear juice and bubbles.
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Draft. A nice very decent cider unfortunately on the tale end of a cider night. Want to try again on a fresh palate. What I noticed of it has me coming back for more. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Well, that one was picked by my wife. Although the idea was good to try pear juice, you don't taste the pear.
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Disgusting! Absolutely disgusting drink. Very little pear flavor, sugar is used to cover up the alcoholic flavor due to the poor quality of the fruit used if any. Aromatics are added that do not fit the drink flavor to cover up more of the poor quality. Extremely over priced as well. This should be $1 dollar a can and that is still too much. This is the worst cidar I have ever drank.
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Pours straw gold with no head. Aroma is apple and pear. Taste is sweet and tart with notes of pear, apricot and mango. Light and fizzy. I’m not big on ciders but this is a better than average one.
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Pint can at Lulu’s Pizza. Initial pour has bubbly head, which fades fast, clear golden body with lazy carbonation. Aroma seems more apples than pears, as does taste. A bit more pear flavor comes in late, finishes clean. Summer quencher.
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Still having trouble rating ciders. Figuring out though that I prefer variations like pear, apricot, mango, etc. over the standard apple. This is one of the popular and trendy ones. Seen it at restaurant or bars to pair with dinner or mixtails and such. Has a dry flavor and feel. Not overly sweet. There is a little tartness at the end. Appearance is a super light green-yellow. Seems a little mass-produced...but not bad.
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);500 ml can. Pours a clear, pale yellow with a thin, fizzy, white head. Aroma of tart pears and sugar. Sweet and tart flavour of pears with a dry finish. Light body with a sticky texture and fizzy carbonation. Tastes like a soda.
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);500ml can. A very pale yellow clear body, small white head with residual foam. Aroma of fermented pears and apples, white wine, candies. Refreshing taste of green grapes and pears, hints of apples and caramel. Much more sour than I expected.
William's Sir Perry;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Magners GB / Shepton Mallet Cider Mill (C&C Group);Nice colour, great deal of carbonation. Nice on the nose, very light tasting, very distinctive wne flavours. Wouldnt buy again.
Feldschlösschen Oktober Festbier;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);Bottled 33cl. It pours a golden beer with a small whitish head. Lots of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The nose has all the typical Feldschlösschen elements. Soy sauce, lemon, bad cheese and garlic?! Decently hoppy. Some sulphur. The taste is mainly of rotten cheese and vegetables. The mouthfeel is horrible. Rather metallic. Some earthy hops show up. A hint of lemon. The finish is of vegetables, soy sauce and lemon.
Feldschlösschen Oktober Festbier;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);Bottled, thanks Bov! Deep golden. Pea soup aroma. Medium bodied with sweetish macro-lager like boiled vegetable flavour. The mouthfeel is raw and mellow. No bitterness. Oh, so Carlsberg owns Feldschlösschen? That explains it...
Feldschlösschen Oktober Festbier;Rheinfelden, Switzerland;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Feldschlösschen (Carlsberg);"clear golden colour with a persistant little foam and a nice lacing; decent herbal hoppiness; clean palate and a medium malt body, creamy mouthfeel and a late moderate bitterness; more malts and herbs in the finish - I cannot believe it but I think Feldschlösschen has just brewed a second decent beer !"
Square One Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Square One Brewery;Draft. Aroma of caramel. Flavors follow nose as this is a sweet version of the style. Bit of chewy oak on the finish.
Square One Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Square One Brewery;[Tap] Tried this at the brewpub in mid-September. Pours a bright orange color with a wispy white head on top. Light caramel, straw and astringent grain nose. The taste was pretty disappointing. Pale lager-like cracker and light caramel malt backbone. No major off flavors. Very light for the style. Looked pretty good, but otherwise I did not enjoy this one very much.
Square One Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Square One Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber color with a small off-white head that leaves some lace. Faint aroma, with notes of caramel malt, dry grains, crackers, and mild spice. Flavor of toasty and caramel malts, graham crackers, sugar, grassy hops, and citrus. Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation. Bitter for the style, with a dry finish. Mediocre Oktoberfest.
Square One Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Square One Brewery;Sampled at the brewpub. Pours orange / amber with a solid tight head. The aroma has sweet caramel malt and bits of spice, fairly clean. Medium body that is lighter than normal for a marzen. There is some gentle carbonation. Flavor starts with caramel mal that is a bit grainy. Not very sweet. There is some nuttiness and hints of stone fruits. The finish gets slightly medicinal and astringent but pulls back to what it should be. There is a lingering taste of bitter lemon for some reason. Okay Oktoberfest.
Square One Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Square One Brewery;Sample #3 from the brew pub. Caramel amber hue. Filtered with a clinging spotty off-white head. Slight caramel, cocoa and bread in the nose. Lively and rich. Medium bodied. Bready malts and a nice hop dryness in the finish. Good balance.
Square One Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Square One Brewery;tap at brewpub-carme lamber with no head but my date had a glass of this and it had a good head-go figure! toasted wet grains on the nose with some light spicy notes from german hops. pretty true to style on the nose. amber grains dominate the flavors with a little hops on the finish. pretty standard for the course, but not bad. body suffers somewhat and their yeast tone from this brewery I could never get into it. I think they repitch too many times.
Square One Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Square One Brewery;On Tap at the brewery Copper with an almost red kind of tint to it. Thin white head that is quickly discipating. The nose is your typical marzen with malt and some cream. The taste reminds me a lot of the spaten oktoberfest with its malt and cream. Overall a very solid oktoberfest.
Square One Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Square One Brewery;Pours a bright gold with a big white head. Not much aroma. Has a sweet toasted maltiness with notes of maple syrup, toffee and spice. A very good effort.
JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Beautiful crystal clear dark golden amber color with a small white head. Clean biscuit malt aroma but not much else. That continues into the taste with a light dry woodiness. Light medium caramel sweetness balanced by a nice earthy bitterness. Doesn't really have the German fest bier flavor. Good amber beer but not really a Marzen/Oktoberfest.
JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Aroma is caramel and mildly sweet bread/malts. The flavor is fruit, malts, caramel and a medium sweet/grainy finish. Smooth, easy to drink, pretty decent.
JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);This is yet another supermarket beer that I consider to be underrated for what it is. C'mon folks, it's a contract beer from Trader Joe's not an import from Germany. And for that matter, you can get 12 ounces for less than a buck 1.50, so sometimes you have to either adjust your price point or adjust your expectations. This Lager pours copper-colored. The head is nice while it lasts, but it doesn't have the greatest retention. Grainy sweet malt smells and flavors. A bit of leafy hop bitterness near the end. Body is light-medium. Carbonation is just shy of sharp - just a bit too lively but not by much. Quite decent overall.
JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);$1.08 bottle, Trader Joe's. Golden Orange with a small white head. Aroma is brown leaf, light caramel, hint of smoke. Flavor is very similar: brown leaf and grass, black tea, black pepper, light smoke. Really not bad - a bit thin, but a buck well spent.
JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);12 oz bottle from Trader Joe's, poured into a tulip glass.

JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Clear copper with a white head. A little bready up front with zest earthy hops. Toasted malt, too. Medium bodied. Surprisingly nice.
JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);"12 ounce bottle Trader Joes is not known for stellar beer. However for less than $1.25 a bottle the cost of entry is pretty low. As a result it got thrown in with the other beers. One is enough; I am not likely to find myself going back again unless the beer budget gets very tight. If Gordon Biersch is your thing though give it a try. Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy coppery body manages to maintain an average clam presence that is the highlight of this beer. The snowy head and idle carbonation trap a mixture of Wurthers, malt, and semisweet chocolate chips. Crispness and freshness can do little to mask a ""meh"" bill. Flavor / Palate - Dry, light, and crisp malts get the job done with little fanfare. There’s not much depth or many style points. Fortunately it also lacks any glaring flaws. This just simply is. One is enough to confirm why I rarely pick up the Josephbrau brand."
JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Pour from a 12oz bottle. Clear light brown brew with tan head. Nice aroma of caramel malt, some complexity in the malt notes, and simple light grassy hops. Taste is standard issue Oktoberfest - slightly sweet up front with a decent degree of hops in the finish. Its not a standout but holds its own and compares favorably to more prominent brands. Pretty good.
JosephsBrau Oktoberfest;Monrovia, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);From the bottle. Malty aroma, light head, medium carbonation.

Itchen Valley Tea Clipper;Alresford, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Itchen Valley Brewery;"Cask at the Bear (JDW), Maidenhead. Amber with a loose cream head; perfumed aroma that immediately made me think of tea - at first I wondered if this was just the power of suggestion from the name, so I was glad to see that there was tea in the recipe; in the mouth it’s very soft with a malty body and an immediate fresh herbal tea-based bitterness; that gives a long dry finish. Certainly full of flavour, and an interesting one at that."

Itchen Valley Tea Clipper;Alresford, Hampshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Itchen Valley Brewery;"Tasted by half-pint at the Magpie&Crown, Brentford, W. London. Served by a handpump. Appearance: translucent, dark amber hue, coming with a nice foamy head and low carbonation. Smell: like another Itchen Valley’s beer tasted immediately before this one (""Wykehams Glory""), the nose is full of aromatic floral hops, which falls behind a sweet peary fruitiness. Simple in composition, but very harmonious and pleasant. Taste: biscuity malts with a mildly caramely edge leads the palate, quickly ensued by a mildly citric, tangy taste of hops and more Fuggles-like bitterness in the end. Good structure. Palate: softly fizzy on the mouthfeel, light-bodied, refreshing... This bitter comes with a good flavour profile and enough hop presence to make it taste more interesting (besides being fresher and nicer in condition) than the Wykeham’s Glory tasted immediately beforehand, hence slightly higher in total score. Not bad~~"
Lodzkie Malinea Fields Premium;Lodz, Poland;Flavored - Fruit;Browary Lodzkie;At first it seemed as a regular Polish fruit beer. It had, however, some actual lager flavour in the end that made it up for the raspberry flavour. Not that terrible, as far as the fruit beers go in this country.
Sianka Rubia;Salta, Argentina;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cervecería Sianka;Bottle, poured a dark amber, lots of carbonation, and a large pillowy white head.

Grizzly Peak Poolside Lager;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Grizzly Peak Brewing Co.;Draught sample at the brewpub, early August 2006. I am SOOO excited that brewpubs are now getting in the act of producing clones of past masterpieces like Schlitz and Natty Boh, let me tell you. Anyway....pale gold with a smallish ring of head, no lacing....faintly grassy, corn-sugarish aroma, reasonably fresh but dull....odd cidery character on the tongue with a trace of ashes, a bit of DMS shows up in the nose as it warms to almost room temp....seems a bit off, overall.
Gardner Original Oktoberfest;Gardner, Massachusetts, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Moon Hill Brewing (Gardner Ale House);On-tap in Gardner. Very decent maltiness and drinkability. Nice copper color - good mouthfeel - medium bodied, and somewhat refreshing.
Bartels;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;From old tasting notes. Pale yellow gold color. Light grainy malt nose. Faint tart Apple taste. Sour grainy finish. Watery and cheap. Back in the 1970’s, you could buy a case of 16 ounce returnables for under $5.00.
Bartels;Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Lion Brewery;Someone I know from the Scranton, PA area bragged to me about how great this beer was so he brought me one. First off the label looked like I made it on my HP Deskjet 400. I have seen better homebrew labels. It was in a 16 oz returnable which was cool. As for the beer? it was thin, fizzy, and pale yellow. It had NO aroma. It was watery and had almost zero flavor, and what little flavor was there reminded me on a watered down Olde English. All I can say is this beer is a conversation piece.

Rock Bottom Yorktown German Hefeweizen;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Sampler glass. Different brewer, different recipe than last summer’s German Hefeweizen. In the sampler glass, it’s cloudy yellow, almost wit colored, with a short, bubbly head. Smells pretty clean, with low esters. Taste starts with a load of banana and a bit of vanilla, but doesn’t sacrifice a good, basic wheat and barley malt background. Clean wheat balance, no lingering taste when done. Earlier Rating: 10/9/2006 Total Score: 3.4 Draft. This would be fine served in their chilled mug, but I think it killed the smell until I could warm it up a little. Cloudy yellow with streaks of orange. When I do get some aroma, it’s just a nice enervating wheat malt. Taste is bit closer to orange than the lemon of other German weizens. I get more of the gently wheat. Only a slight hint of the style’s usual banana and clove, but I didn’t really missit, until some ’nanner came up later when I burped… pard’ me!
Rock Bottom Yorktown German Hefeweizen;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Well hazed golden, near opaque with a holding white head. Banana, banana and more banana in the nose. Thick creamy mouth with a hearty, fruity, yeasty flavor. I like the smell and taste of bananas, so I’m cool with this brew but I would normally hope for a little more complexity. On tap at Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL 60148
Rock Bottom Yorktown German Hefeweizen;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rock Bottom Yorktown;An original from Chris Boggess’ recipe book: Kind of scary looking, actually, the cloudiest hefeweizen that I’ve ever seen. The creamy head that does excellent lacing makes up for the frightening look of the body. The aroma is strong with fresh bananas and a touch of clove. Nice & creamy mouthfeel. Plenty of the bananas, some wheat, clove, and other spices make up the taste. Slated as a Summer special, this is a refreshing drink however late in the season. And despite its disturbing appearance. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL
Baird American Dream Strong Pale Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Strong Ale - American;Baird Brewing Co.;Med-dark amber color. Smells like the fruit cups I used to bring to school in junior high, grapes, bananas, apples, kiwi. Well balanced mouth with some grapenuts. Slight hop bitterness, but not too hoppy. Bitter dry grapefruit finish. Lighter body than I expected, but nice.
Baird American Dream Strong Pale Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Strong Ale - American;Baird Brewing Co.;"golden brown in color with an off white head. butterscotch nose with citrus floral overtones. bitter hop character up front. not a strong pale feel more of a standard pale. tangy extract malt tips that stick to your palate. a low abv for a strong ale but i guess still in its class. would work out to be better in just plane ""pale"" genre."
Collaborator Ember Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Nice dark amber in color, very clear, with a off white head. The smoking on this brew was excellent, not over the top, but not weak by any means. The bartender said this was a smoked porter, but didn’t seem like a porter to me. Great caramel sweetness up front that really just mixed very smoothly with the smokiness. This brew never felt out of synch, all the flavors just worked perfectly together, and I never got tired of this beer (as I do with some smoked beers) just a delight to drink the whole way through. The best collaborator brew so far in my opinion.

Aroma of chocolate, swet wood smoke, caramel with just a little burnt edge. birch beer-ish color, slightly darkened & thin head. kind of anonymous in the mouth. falvor on the sweet side, maple, something dark & dry. more like a smoked baltic porter than anglo-american, unique but not fully realized.
Collaborator Ember Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Widmer Brothers Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Collaborator Project in the form of a smoked porter on tap at Oaks Bottom. Definite smoked malt aroma. Super-clear beer, darkest of browns with a ruby hue when backlit. Fair off-white head with no lacing left behind. Nice smoked flavor plays well with the chocolate dominant malt flavors. A bit thin in body. Nicely done, just a bit lacking in body flavor.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle- Pours a deep amber body with brownish hues. The head is short lived and pink. Nose is fruit(strawberry) and sugar and weird malts and a slight funk. Tart and sweet strawberry, with very sweet malts and some burnt sugars with very little in the way of balancing(hops). Caramel malt and fruit finish. Cloying, messy, nope, not again. Thanks Dave!
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;tried at the c’est what? spring beer night. Very similar to the debeau cherry, this must be another failed experiment. Another fruit beer that doesnt taste of fruit at all, i’m getting more caramel from the maltiness than anything else. there is a slight fruity tinge in the aroma, and i’m not een sure its strawbeery. dismal at best.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;[164-20061228] 200mL. Smells like really rotten fermented strawberries and strong chocolate. Clear, dark brown body with no head but white bubbles. Flavour is reminiscent of chocolate-covered strawberries. Medium body with an interesting roundness. Terrible first impression but eventually evened out.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle from the brewery. Brown with ruby tints and a tiny head. Sweet aroma of caramel malt, with mild hints of strawberry and pink bubblegum. Same light body as the cherry. Flavour follows the aroma - sweet malt, very faint strawberry. Like the cherry beer, it’s not bad, just boring, and doesn’t have much fruit character.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle courtesy of GregClow. Pours a hazy dark ruby-brown with a spare diminishing off-white head. Aroma of caramel malt, some strawberries but not much and a hint of spices -- pretty blah. Flavour of caramel malt and a light taste of strawberries and chocolate. Light bodied. Pretty mediocre stuff.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Dark brown in colour with low carbonation. Aromas of strawberry, chocolate, and caramel. There’s also a bit of a boozy note, which seems out of place for a 5.5% beer. More chocolate-caramel flavors in the mouth, with a bit of stale coffee and sweet strawberry extract. Hollow palate in spite of the sweetness. It might pass as a dessert beer. Needs some acidity and some more pale malt to balance things out. Thanks to gregclow for the sample.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;A dark reddih ruby brown ale with a thin off white head. Aroma is of light porto, berries and maderized cardboad. In mouth, a dead stalre beer, with a light residual sugar, light strawberry extract, no body, a bit of a stale watery brew. Bottle courtsey of KProbst, Oct. 2006.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle (200ml - clear). Courtesy of GregClow. Deep clear ruby with a large frothy slightly pink lasting head. Aroma is very much like their Debau-Cherry - pretty lush strawberry & cream up front, soon devolving to mildly papery caramel malt with some herbal notes - this one’s a little more appealing than the ’Cherry - and a sweeter, too. The taste is again a big let-down - slightly tart strawberry gives way to stale cardboard malt and a stale bitterness in the finish. Watery, thin, flat body, slightly ugly aftertaste - interesting, but not a success.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle. Brown body with a small off white head with a light pink tint fades. Sweet aroma with notes of vanilla extract, and rooty notes over a rather muted strawberry, and slight notes of chocolate. Flavour is muted and muddled. Sweet malt, hints of cocoa and very muted strawberry. average palate is a touch flat but slightly more full bodied than average. A bit muted and simplistic at times but hints at potential - needs more of everything, more oomph. I was a bit worried opening this one since the bottle of their wheat I opened earlier in the day was very badly infected, but this one showed no such signs and was pleasant.
Trafalgar Strawberry Anti-Social;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;"200ml Bottle, thanks to GregClow for obtaining it from the brewery: This one starts off great with a deep ruby brown pour with a creamy head accompanied by excellent lacing. The aroma is ripe, real strawberries with noticeable alcohol notes and demara sugar. Sadly, things take a bend right around tasting time. The strawberries are muted, as I’d hoped, but sadly so is everything else. The sugar and alcohol are mildly present - too much alcohol for 5.5% - but the entire thing tastes watered down. No mouthfeel, no substance, no body at all. If they can figure the process out I think the potential is big; reality, not so much."
Newport Beach Snug Harbor Honey Ale;Newport Beach, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Newport Beach Brewing Company;Sampled on 4/18/2010 at the brewery/brewpub.

Mostly transparent, coppery amber colored body with a finger of fizzy off-white head. Aromas of lightly toasty malt and some mild-moderate minty hops. Low-moderate fruity ester qualities and a faint caraway-like spiciness in the background. Medium bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a soft, malty texture.

Moderate fruity esters provide a subtle red fruit dimension that enhances the malt perception somewhat. Clean and pleasant to drink and showcases all of the stylistic dimensions nicely, but a bit more of an assertive hop character would be nice.

Placerville Vanilla Stout;Placerville, California, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Placerville Brewing Company;4 ounce sample at the California Brewer’s Festival. Sample #1. Aroma is quite sweet with plenty of milk chocolate and vanilla beans. Lightly roasted, pleasant. Virtually opaque dark brown-black body with a small, tan head. Quite roasted, burnt, ashy, black patent start. Becomes quite sweet and vanilla-like in the middle. A bit of chocolate later on with some more lingering black patent bitterness. A bit too burnt and thin-bodied.

Lockdown Represa Red Ale;Folsom, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lockdown Brewing Company;nothing special, but 13th percentile is style seems a tad harsh. More nutty red than amber, or at least a hybrid. enjoyed enough, but no need to get again.

Lockdown Represa Red Ale;Folsom, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lockdown Brewing Company;Uh oh... infected bottle alert. This one was purchased at Total Wine & More in Sac. All foam in the glass, literally no liquid. A sip of liquid from the bottle turned to instant foam in my mouth with a gagging, soapy, plastic, metallic flavor. I’m sorry to have to do this, but poor quality control deserves a poor rating.

Lockdown Represa Red Ale;Folsom, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lockdown Brewing Company;A 12 oz. bottle from Hayduke with whom it was shared via Facebook chat. This beer poured a hazy light brown with an evenly layered tan head of small bubbles. The nose began with malt but soon was floral and pine hops. The flavor is not really a red ale which is what the name says. A pale ale is closer. The hops are center with that pine and floral. They are rather bitter but there is only a small taste of grapefruit. Caramel malt and some nice fruit compliment. This was a nice beer with just enough complexity and some nice tastes. A very nice beer from Lockdown.

Lockdown Powerhouse Pale Ale;Folsom, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lockdown Brewing Company;On tap @ Lockdown. The pour is sort of a golden orange color with a white head. Notes of orange, earthy, and floral hops on the nose. Some bread, mild spice and pine. There’s a mild bitterness to the flavor. Orange peel and pine, mild lemon, grass, and floral hops. Some bready malt gives a light sweetness. Kind of grainy.

Lockdown Powerhouse Pale Ale;Folsom, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lockdown Brewing Company;"12oz bottle, purchased at Total Wine & More - Roseville. While not stellar, this is still significantly better than the draft version at the brewery (the added carbonation helps). Pours a bright, slightly hazy orange color; huge, textured off-white head that lasts forever. Light, soapy aroma with a whiff of green apple / acetaldehyde; minimal hops or malts. Medium body; fluffy, lively carbonation; some soapiness and green apple notes, again, along with very modest levels of earthy/spicy hop flavor and bitterness, and a maltiness that really only shows itself as a toastiness in the finish. A green-apple spritzer, essentially, but not painfully so."

Lockdown Powerhouse Pale Ale;Folsom, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lockdown Brewing Company;This was enjoyed in a joint Facebook tasting with Strykzone. From the 12 oz bottle this poured a very clear gold color with a huge white head and glue like lacing rings. The nose is mild and of citrus and floral hops aromas, backed by caramel malts with a touch of grain. Body is medium, and the mouthfeel soft. The flavor starts out with floral hops, followed by citrus and continues to evolve until li finishes strong with a pine bitterness. While this is listed here as an English Pale Ale, it seemed pretty classic APA to me.
Lockdown Powerhouse Pale Ale;Folsom, California, United States;Pale Ale - English;Lockdown Brewing Company;Thanks to Hayduke with whom a Facebook chat / tasting was thoroughly enjoyed. This beer pours a clear golden with a big off white fluffy and pillowy. It lasts quite a long time before collapsing. The aroma is not big at all and has some citrus, floral, caramel, and grain. Flavor was floral hops, pine, and citrus with some caramel. That grain, too. This isn’t an English Pale Ale but more of an American version. There might be a smidge of European hops but not a lot. This beer was muddled and didn’t quite know what it wanted to be. That is due to a hop profile that doesn’t quite work. It did finish nicely.

Lockdown Aunt Emmas Blonde Ale;Folsom, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lockdown Brewing Company;Kindly sent my way by Hayduke whit whom it was shared via Facebook chat with he and his brother Rick. This poured a mostly clear golden but with lots of tiny yeast particles suspended. A nice white soapy head that lasted a couple of minutes. The aroma was like candy with bubble gum and bananas. Those were prominent in the flavor as well. Throw in some hops with some nice citrus and it made for a very easy to drink beer. It was akin to a hefe but with a hint of attitude from the hops. Refreshing to the max! Perhaps the perfect lawn mowing beer. It did’t try to do too much and it succeeded that much more.

Top of the Hill Hugh Morton Mango Lager;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Top of the Hill Brewery;Basically Magic Hat #9 with mango instead of apricot. Clear dark gold pour with no head. Aroma and flavor are both marked by cereal grain, heavy mango presence, and maybe the slightest touch of floral hop. Palate is very light, bubbly, and crisp. Mediocre.
Top of the Hill Hugh Morton Mango Lager;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Top of the Hill Brewery;On tap. Had this a long time ago but it was simple enough to remember in detail. Obviously it is discontinued now. Pours a clear orange with no head- so no lacing. Not a great start. Aroma of canned mango, wheat, lemon, straw/hay. Taste is very watery with an obvious mango presence that is not sweet like added fruit juice but is more subtle as in making itself known through the malt and cereal grain flavors. Not sure what the purpose of the beer is but it is a very poor showing and significantly less impressive than their new fruit beer: the blueberry wheat.
Top of the Hill Hugh Morton Mango Lager;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Top of the Hill Brewery;Pours a light yellow with no head. Nice aroma of mango but the flavor was very lacking and kind of dry. Not one of their better beers.
Top of the Hill Hugh Morton Mango Lager;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Top of the Hill Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a clear golden color. Head was one finger high and white. There was a little lace on the glass at the end. Aroma was fruit dominated, mostly mango and peach. Dry on the tongue with a pleasant fresh honey-touched cereal grain flavor accented by peach and mango. There were also some noble hops. Pretty decent.
Top of the Hill Hugh Morton Mango Lager;Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Top of the Hill Brewery;Great for a light, refreshing summer beer. The flavor is subtle (more apparent in the aroma), and it’s not sweet (about the same sweetness as a Belgian white). Low alcohol content, so take it for what it’s worth.

Big Horse Soul Rebel;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Other;Big Horse Brewing;Tap at brewery. Ginger. That is what this is all about. Lots of the stuff, dripping with ginger in the nose, flavor and aftertaste. Initially it’s pretty shocking, after the first three gulps it tones down and is actually not unpleasant to drink. Suprisingly two beer novices that I shared this with enjoyed it. Medium golden in color, head fades pretty quickly with no real lacing left. An interesting beer although one I wouldn’t drink with regularity.
Dry Dock USS Brown;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Dry Dock Brewing Company;tap at the brewery. dark brown mahogany. nice nutty aroma with some light cocoa and a hint of smoke. a quencher, this would work better with some food. sweet at first with some brown sugar and peanut flavor. an enjoyable brew that doesn’t finish well for me. something perfumy in the finish that doesn’t compliment this. still drinkable, but unpleasant.
Fiddler Herfstbock;Den Haag, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;De Haagsche Bierbrouwerij;Draft at the brewpub - the pump clip said 6,8%. Sweet bock, true to the style, but much too sweet for my liking. Like they have diluted brown sugar in the beer!
Fiddler Herfstbock;Den Haag, Netherlands;Bock - Dunkler Bock;De Haagsche Bierbrouwerij;Brewery tap. Dark brown color. Toffee and a hint of roast in the aroma. Blackcurrant, butterscotch, butter and licorice in the flavor. Long licorice bitter aftertaste. More like a strong ale instead of a bock. Nevertheless a fine beer.

Big Rock Chop House Belgian Style Tripel;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Served in a pint glass with an orange and golden hue.

Big Rock Chop House Belgian Style Tripel;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;7-22-06 MBG. Copper with white film for head. Aroma has tons of candi sugar, some nice floral and spicy/herbal notes. Flavor on par, candi sugar dominates, floral character come through a tad near the finish. Doesn’t have that drying alcoholic bite most tripels have, but I would take this over other examples any day. Well done.
Big Rock Chop House Belgian Style Tripel;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Tripel;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;This draft brew from a festival poured a small sized head of foamy fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that was mostly lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated dark orange colored body. The aroma was sweet. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish mild vinous aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of smooth malt sweet mildly vinous and mild caramel. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.

North By Northwest Guldenbiere (2006);Austin, Texas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;North By Northwest Restaurant and Brewery;"750 ml bottle into Pizza Port pint glass; obtained from fly, my 2007 Secret Santa (thanks to him for this seemingly very rare beer). Yeasty smells all over the place; lemony and skunky at first, it reminds me of a pilsener more than a Belgian beer. When you stick your nose in the glass you get the more characteristic bready and horseblanket aromas, with an undercurrent of woodland berries. Medium bodied in the mouth and very soft, the very gentle carbonation goes well with lactic sweetness in the finish. Lightly fruity middle with very identifiable notes of juicy pear. Reminds me a little bit of a green-tea mochi ball in the flavor both in the middle and late in the finish. A refreshing beer that does what it does well."

Cloudy, yellowish-honey color; white head with good retention and lacing. Dense, floral-dominated aroma; plenty of fresh-cut flowers, white pepper, and yeast.

Medium, doughy and yeasty finish."

Southampton Belgian Amber Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;Growler filled at the Publick House and consumed later the same day. Pours a nearly clear amber with a moderate yellow-white head that lasted until mid-glass and left ample lace. Pleasant spicy aroma with some malt present in the nose as well. The flavor is spicy Belgian yeast with some malt. Dries out as it approaches the finish, where some cracker and black pepper emerge. The black pepper lingers at the back of throat well into the aftertaste. Medium bodied.
Southampton Belgian Amber Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;On tap at Southampton...Murky, orange body with barely a head, even though it was straight from the tap. It has a very pungent and yeasty nose, not as spicy as I wanted it to be. Also it was surprisingly uncomplex in general, with no qualtiies I look for in a Belgian beer. The flavor is malty, and sour. The tartness really stands out. What is this beer? I’m not so fond of it.
Southampton Belgian Amber Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;Tap at the publick house - very hazy, moslty golden (amber?) out of the tap - very musty, earthy aroma, with hints of lemon, a tiny bit of spice and belgian sugar - a bit spicy up front, followed in the middle by an unexpected tartness/sourness that I’m not entirely sure the brewer intended - a bit of thin malts come on the back end of that, along with light orange flavor - the unwelcome tartness never completely goes away though - is it possible that this beer was infected?
Southampton Belgian Amber Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;on tap at the publick house. hazy golden amber color, very light tan creamy head. candi sugar malt and lemony banana aroma too. flavor is lemony banana, a little tart and dry, wheat malt?
Southampton Belgian Amber Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;gee Joe, i kind of liked this one. Well its better this way, we can keep that record of having almost exactly opposite tastes. Poured into a pint, color is orang-amber with a small but stable head. Aroma is present - beglain fruitiness and fruit sweetness. Taste is more spiced - allspice, nutmeg, cinamon. Leaves a fruity belgian aftertaste.
Southampton Belgian Amber Ale;Southampton, New York, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Southampton Publick House;Tap at the Publick House. Hazy amber colour with an initially lovely spicy aroma of clove, allspice and cinnamon with banana and peach fruitiness over the back. Flavour though is like sucking on old bandaids. Incredibly phenolic and sulfurous with plasticy notes as well. Light caramel malt that probably would have worked if the yeast hadn’t gone crazy. It started out okay, but this one got away from them.
Labatt Winchester;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Decent beer, very refreshing would suit a summer day and a ploughmans lunch
Labatt Winchester;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Pint of the ""house"" beer at Regal Beagle actually half a pitcher. The ""short"" pour in this case was the big one. Held a good head on a gold beer. Tasted like malt liquor without the malt and without the liquor. Just an off alcohol taste, mixed sweetness and weird off-grainy flavours. The wings helped make the beer go down easier. Piping hot big salt-n-pepper wings."
Labatt Winchester;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);Bright pale yellow colour with a very perfect inch-thick (artificially stabilized) head. The aroma is light pale malt, fresh and breezy. Flavour is sweetish, but more balanced than most macrobrews. The malts are again very clean and breezy. The finish shows a hint of flowery hop as well. As clean and balanced a beer as I’ve had from Labatts. Well worth the trip out to Esquisurrey...I was hoping for a debacle and instead got a really nice macrobrew.Update: Hey Vancouver! Winchester is on tap at Hippo’s Sports Bar at Fraser & Marine. And it’s quite a bit worse than the stuff I rated at the Tudor House. Don’t delay!
Labatt Winchester;London, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Labatt Brewing Company (AB InBev);(Draught) Sampled at Tudor House in Esquimalt for $2.75/sleeve. They wash the tabletops with fortified vinegar at Tudor House so its difficult to make the aroma - nose of banana Runts and lemon. Cleaar, very mild carbonation. Flavour is somewhat clean with only a mild maltedness and 2% milk in the finish.
Middle Mountain Cyser;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;pours light white wine yellow. Light apple juice and “that” jalapeno/bell pepper vegetation on the nose. Attack: jalapeno pepper (without the spiciness) Mid-palate: 5/10-dense sweetness, mild apple, honey Finish: medium tartness, clean tangy light-med sweet finish. That jalapeno I taste is the same flavour I get when I infuse vodka with jalapenos for a few months. It’s not exactly pleasant but works okay in this case due to the existence of honey in the mix. Overall this is a slightly above average mead because I enjoy it’s drinkability and clean finish.
Middle Mountain Cyser;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Clear liquid with a soft aroma of sweetness. Taste is soft and a little sweeter than I was hoping. Not as good as the European meads I’ve had but a decent effort. Will have to seek out more from B.C.’s meaderies.
Middle Mountain Cyser;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Bottled. A light golden mead. The aroma has notes of sweet honey as well as light notes of rosehips. The flavor is odd with notes of spices and honey. Thanks Alex for sharing.
Middle Mountain Cyser;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;"Still, blond color. The aroma is a delicate mix of apples and honey, a bit flowery, already dry. The flavor reminds a german Riesling, just with a bit more body and maybe sweetness, lightly fruity; the final is nice and complex, the mouthfeeling mostly; alcohol well hidden. A new experience after the sweet European Meads, it’s like a good oxidized white wine, amazing."
Middle Mountain Cyser;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;(Bottle 75 cl) Courtesy of fiulijn. Clear pale golden - no head. sweetish apple aroma with a discreet whiff of honey. Surprisingly light-bodied, dry and tart - the cider really dominates here, while the honey mostly is a piquant whiff. Dry and lightly tart finish. Interesting and rather refreshing - almost like a dry white wine. 300808

Sweet and phenolic apple dry base flavour with no sweetness what so ever. Lasting phenolic and dry finish.
Middle Mountain Cyser;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;[Papsoe tasting 31-08-2008, thanks buddy] Bottle. Pale yellow color. Aromas of medicine, elderflower, honey, alcohol, hint of citrus and apple. Over the palate came mild medicine and what appeared as cider like lively pickling sparkles and alcohol. Very strange and unique mix of cider and mead. Full bodied with a soft carbonation (if any) and thick alcoholic texture. Heavy sweet flavor with light notes of acidic. Lingering sweet honey and medicine finish with an acidic twist.
Middle Mountain Cyser;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Golden colour. Still. Lightly fruity, with a complex alcohol signature. Dry. Palate is austere, tastes like a Coen Brothers movie, with an alcohol plotline and appley characters, all set in a rustic meadery. Simplistic structure yet complex as all hell. This cyser is an intellectual exercise.
Middle Mountain Lavender Cranberry Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Visual: Pours a very light orange with a hint of purple. Miniscule sedimentation in the pour. Nose: apple cider vinegar and cranberry on the nose. (6)-aromatic strength. Attack: incoming sweet and acidic sourness, supple mouthfeel Mid-palate: (MAIN) apple cider vinegar, (7)-sourness, (5)-tartness, (5)-sweetness (HINT) cranberry, lavender Finish: light-medium alcohol warmth, medium-heat spicy, sweet-tart finish. Summary: Quite interesting and sippable at room. It’s got a nice balance of sweet-fruit-sour-tart-spice-alcohol in there. (Note: all numbers above are on a 10-point scale, with 1 being weak and 10 being the strongest)
Middle Mountain Lavender Cranberry Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Bottle* 375ml. [ Courtesy of fiulijn ].

Middle Mountain Lavender Cranberry Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Handbottle 10 cl. Courtesy of fiulijn. Slightly hazy pale golden with a vague pinkish whiff. Acetone notes in the nose and even some cranberry shining through. Medium body, lightly sweet spicy honey but also a light tartness and a chemical edge to it. A rather confusing construction. 200412
Middle Mountain Lavender Cranberry Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Handbottle. Pours pale pinkish, no head. Aroma is citrici and herbal honey. Smooth fruity, cranberry and lavender. Mild citric mixed with a light sweetness. Smooth fruity and lig sweet finish.
Middle Mountain Lavender Cranberry Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;"Bottle from Spinnakers Spirit Merchants, Victoria, synthetic cork Pale color, close to transparent, with a red-pinkish hue. The aroma is delicate, with some berry fruit, vinegar, glue; actually quite fresh. Semi-sweet Mead, with a lean body, and a mild vinegar acidity; there is a mild fruity trace, light glue and a hidden acetone and lavender note; the final also shows a very light astringency. Vinegar is an unusual component for a Mead, but in mild doses and with some fruits is interesting. The lavender is not really evident, and this is maybe good news."
Middle Mountain Lavender Cranberry Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;"Tall, runway model slim 375ml bottle. Very light beach coloured still liquid. Thin scent, alcohol, like a white wine. Nice fruit taste at the start; apples and strong honey. Body has a little more depth, in texture and in flavour, than the other four I have tried from this producer. Strong liquid honey body. Could use more tartness but by the far the most substantial character, other than the spiced mead. I think that the lavender adds a gentleness to the flavour."
Middle Mountain Lavender Cranberry Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;(Bottle) Sampled at the Royal BC Museum. Comes across more as a tart appley-mead than cranberries - though I did have a small sampling. This item doesn’t hide its ABV as well as the Cyser so there is a small alcohol burn in the finish. Very good.
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;First mead, so bear with me trying to review it. Poured at a restaurant, heated in a glass placed in a mug of hot water for 1 minute. Clear, pinkish orange. Aroma has honey and cinnamon with some alcohol. Flavour like a light fruit wine, not overly flavourful. Lighter body.
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Bottle at Burgoo on 10th Ave W, Vancouver Pale red color. Delicate fruity aroma. Unfortunately they tried to warm it up, so the flavor reminds me of ghlübier (mulled beer, like Unibroue Quelque Chose), it has a pleasant fruity flavor, moderate sweetness, and not much mead character, more a fruit wine.
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Purchased in Vancouver private store. Pours Rose coloured. Very attractive spices, smooth taste, though somewhat alcohol warming. Very tasty mead.
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Bottle from the Otown throwdown. Light orange pour. Layers of spices and honey notes linger throughout the aroma. Flavor is very tropical and fruity. Nice and delicate.
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;FRO Throwdown: Peach color. Cinnamon comes through quite clearly. Wasn’t expecting it! Light honey tones throughout.
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Sample at O-town throwdown ’09 pours orange with viscous lacing. Aroma / taste are just very sweet-honey and filled with amazing spices. Im a really starting to enjoy these Canadian meads and mead in general. Spices add a nice warming mouthfeel.
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Thank you Oakes! Glowing orange color with legs. Aroma is lovely and floral also and full of fun fruits including pineapple, apricot, melon. This is the best mead I’ve had to date. Finishes dry. Retains tons of flowers in the body. Pineapple again. Then apricot. Guava, passion, and other tart tropical fruits join the party. Excellent mead!
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Golden amber-orange colour. The aroma is big mead, cinnamon, ginger and apple...oh yeah. Warming, with a muscular alcohol presence. But it’s smooth, tempered by enough residual honey...full-bodied stuff. Deft touch on the spicing - this is well seasoned with the nutmeg and cinnamon.
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Bottle… This mead rocks!... Mostly clear amber mead with orange highlights and decent legwork. Rich maple and honey aroma with a wealth of spices unknown (if not for the commercial description). Barely medium-bodied - a bit thin. Certainly well-balanced for a mead. Sweet, herbal, earthy flavors. Dry, almost-raspy finish. I’d like to know the ABV as it’s either relatively low or expertly disguised. Kudos to Oakes for sharing this gem!
Middle Mountain Alpenglow Mead;Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada;Mead;Middle Mountain Mead;Courtesy Oakes. Pours a fairly clear reddish orange, with a lightly syrupy texture. Very spicy nose to it. All sorts of stuff going on here, mint, graham crackers, earth, and honey. Really dug the nose. The flavor is also pretty spicy, some floral notes, and sweet honey combine to form the flavor profile for this mead. I didnt like the flavor as much as the nose, but it was still pretty solid. Not as hot in the finish, but the floralness was there all the way to the end. Pretty solid mead.
Mad Anthony Belgian Golden Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;Sample at the Ft. Wayne brewpub. Clear golden color with a medium white head that evaporates steadily to an outer ring. Partial rings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of yeast, hops and malt. Medium-bodied with flavors of herbal yeast, fruit and spicy hops. The finish is fruity yeast up front with a mildly hoppy aftertaste. Decent overall.

Mad Anthony Belgian Golden Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of frothy fine to large sized white colored bubbles that was mostly diminishing and left behind a transparent typically carbonated dark yellow colored body and a fair lacing. The mild aroma was banana. The mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mellow finish with a mellow vinous aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of malt hops banana vinous and softly acidic. An OK brew just nothing special.
Mad Anthony Belgian Golden Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Mad Anthony Brewing Co.;draft - Pours transparent gold with a very thin head. The aroma is mostly sweet malt and candi sugar. The flavor is also very sweet with a little mild hops in the finish, but not much. It’s smooth and medium bodied.

Lilys Rutgers Rye;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;"Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a yellow to semi-pale light orange color with a bar pour’s kind of white semi-foamy head. Mild carbonation could be seen rising. The aroma smelled like rye bread but mainly in a sweet way. Light grassy hops. The flavor was also sweet through the breadiness and the rye was even fainter in this department compared to the aroma. Mild bready aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. Bready smoothness really scales down any sort of suspected rye harshness. Overall, for a rye beer, it leans towards the sweet side a bit more than expected and honestly, as a fan of rye beers, I tend to like the blend of ""sweet"" to ""spicy"" portions melding together. This didn’t do that."
Lilys Rutgers Rye;Royal Oak, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Lilys Seafood Restaurant & Brewery;This draft brew from a festival poured a small sized head of fine to medium sized white colored bubbles that was mostly lasting and left behind a transparent softly carbonated light yellow colored body. The weak aroma was hoppy malty and bready. The thin mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start mediumly tingly at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt mild hops and was slightly acidic. Not one that I would likely buy again.

Weltons Summer Hays;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Cask at Draft House. Pale yellow, light haze, decent foamy white head. Aroma has straw with some light vinegary lemon. Body is medium, low carbonation, smooth. Taste is light with some wet hay, a bit soupy, astringent grapefruit finish with a breathy bitterness. OK, astringency reduces the quaffability.
Weltons Summer Hays;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Cask conditioned - handpump - Red Lion, Milford on Sea. A hazy copper colourd beer with an aroma featuring some lemony hops. The taste is bitter with more citrus hops.

Dark Star Double Chocolate Stout;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Stout;Dark Star Brewing Co. (Asahi);1st December 2009 Pigs Ear. Very dark brown beer, clear at the edges. Light palate. Seems like a porter to me! Light tangy malt - and err no real chocolate. Finishes light and with more porter like tang. Not bad but way to miss your own beer title!

Aroma has fermented apple juice. Taste has sweet, almost full bodied apple juice. Finish has light tartness. Feels rushed - needs some more woody notes and complexity that develops over time. It's perfectly drinkable but I wouldn't give this any medals."
Mountain Crest Gold Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;330 ml bottle, as Mountain Crest Canadian Lager, from Mountain Crest Brewing Company, Calgary. Brewed with Canadian 2 Row Malt. ABV is 4.7%. Bought at Vaaland, Bryne. Pale golden colour, moderate white head. Moderate grassy aroma. Bland flavour, but no offensive side-notes. Some malty sweetness, very moderate hops. Won’t buy again.
Mountain Crest Gold Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;On bottle as Mountain Crest Canadian Lager at Meny, Vollebekk. Golden color, good foam- stays for a good while. Aromas of boiled vegetables, some malt- When beer gets tempered nasty aromas makes a solid presense, papir. Light body & complexity. Some bitterness Not good stuff
Mountain Crest Gold Lager;Monroe, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Minhas Craft Brewery;I got this after taking the brewery tour at Minhas. This pours a clear, pale yellow color with a foamy, off-white head. The scent is mostly of grassy grains. There is a pretty good punch from the grain flavor but it doesn’t exactly make for a good taste. Drinks a little chewy and finishes slightly bitter and chalky. A nice step up from Budweiser, but that’s about it.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bought in the variety pack. Another decent beer by Michelob. These guys could be my favorites of the domestic swill. This sort of reminded me of Shocktop or Blue Moon, but with more of a Belgian feel. Has more fruity flavors such as bananas, cloves, and extra sugar added....also citrusy of course. Lots of sweets, but a little tartness to balance it out. Pours a hazy light orange/darker yellow color. Not a lot of carb. on this one. Glad I sampled in the variety pack, cause I would look for this again as a lawnmower and/or economy beer.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);This beer has a hazy and bright straw yellow colored body with a nice two to three finger white head. The head fades slowly and its lacing is slick. The aroma is full of nice banana and some light clove notes from the yeast which also adds nice bready notes to the sweet wheat maltiness in the aroma. There is a tasty sweet bready/wheaty malt base with a nice fruity yeast character that adds to the base maltiness. The banana notes are sweet up front then dry out a touch towards the finish. The body and texture have an average medium feel with average carbonation.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Pours a cloudy (unfiltered) yellow-orange color with a head that stands up about 3/4 of an inch tall. Head quickly reduced to a ring of foam that only covered the outer ring of the glass. Smells of bready/wheaty malts and spices. Taste is similar to others in this style, but I found this beer to have a slight metallic taste towards the finish.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle. Pours a hazy dark golden with a decent white head. Nice aroma of bubble gum and clove with hints of lemon and banana. Flavors of clove, lemon and banana with a hint of some other spice. Decent for a German hefe and also for A-B.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Decent if faint banana and yeast aroma, not a horrible interpretation of a hefeweizen.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);A pleasant carbonation is offset by the watery, sour finish. Not enough of that yeasty punch that I like out of a Bavarian style beer. On a hot summer day, it may hit the spot.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a tall Pilsner glass. There appears to be no freshness date only an odd bottle number. (09232 VB49) Appearance: This beer has a hazy and bright straw yellow colored body with a nice two to three finger white head. The head fades slowly and its lacing is slick. Smell: The aroma is full of nice banana and some light clove notes from the yeast which also adds nice bready notes to the sweet wheat maltiness in the aroma. Taste/Palate: There is a tasty sweet bready/wheaty malt base with a nice fruity yeast character that adds to the base maltiness. The banana notes are sweet up front then dry out a touch towards the finish. The body and texture have an average medium feel with average carbonation. Notes: This is an all-around solid beer in my opinion and one that I would like to see it by itself in 6 packs.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Pours a hazy pale orange. Head dissipated almost immediately. No lacing. I can smell the sweet aroma from feet away. On closer inspection a sickly sweet smell overpowers everything else. Smell artificial orange flavoring and something that smells vaguely of circus peanut candy. The more I smell it the more unpleasant it becomes. An otherwise completely average hefe weizen is made worse by artificial orange flavoring and watery mouthfeel. This is more like a beer flavored soda than a beer.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a medium sized off white head and decent carbonation. The aroma provides a nice whiff of banana, some cloves, yeast. The flavor is primarily banana with cloves, yeast and wheat playing secondary roles. Light-medium bodied, refreshing. For what it is, this wasn’t a bad option at a party with non craft beer types.
Michelob Bavarian Style Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Definite banana and clove aroma and taste with a phenolic aftertaste (which is something I desire in a Hefe-style). Not too bad, but not the best in this style.

Wychwood WychCraft (Cask);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);A recent addition to the Wychwood portfolio.

Wychwood WychCraft (Cask);Witney, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wychwood Brewery (Marston's);Cask gravity at Bowl Inn, Charing. I don’t often get the chance to try Wychwood beers in cask, so I’d thought I would try this. Copper colour with lasting off white head. Yeast/hop aroma, ok in mouth, malts are pale and not over the top. Hop on finish is a little dusty, but got good citrus flavours and definite dryness. Reasonably pleasant.

Rich's Cider Vintage Medium Cider;Highbridge, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Rich's Cider;1l flagon, bought from the farm in October 2004. Dry version bought at the same time and rated in December 2004. Not surprisingly, this is similar to the dry (qv) but sweeter. A bit too sweet for me if anything. The sweetness may have been accentuated by the couple of years aging softening out the tannins. Like the Dry, this is very dark for a cider. It seems to have darkened even more with age to deep tawny/ruby colour. Still some fruit left. The oak aging has left its mark in a vanilla tinged aroma. Also a slightly rubbery edge. Very mellow mouthfeel with vinous elements and raisins, to go with the smooth apple backdrop. Interesting, but I preferred the younger Dry version.

Rock Bottom South Denver Oak Aged Vanilla Porter;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom South Denver;The Rock Bottom set of reviews is a reflection of my hasty attempt to drink a small quantity of many beers and produce accurate and helpful reviews. Clearly I’ve failed, but I hope my incoherent and cryptic critiques can help at least a few folks who wander in and want to know what to order. Note: I had this at the Rock Bottom South Denver location. Simply put, the Vanilla Bean Stout is a failed attempt at a sweet stout. What was in my glass was no sweet beer. It was a liquid most disappointing. The appearance is a dull monolithic black with no head, but the nose is an outré combination of cookies and vanilla. Sadly, the taste is a flop, adhering to a simple formula of simple malts bitterness. It hardly allows any of the vanilla to struggle through. Yet another tally mark to count the disappointing sweet stouts I’ve had thus far.
Rock Bottom South Denver Oak Aged Vanilla Porter;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Porter;Rock Bottom South Denver;tap at the s. denver location. (o.k., first th ing to be aware of, idthat i am typing this out while hammered and sipping a vodka drink after spending quite a bit of time at the brewpub, just know that this was the first beer i had trhere and the only i took notes on,) solid black pour with a nice lasting & lacing coffee with cream coored head. aroma is an assload of chocolate, wet rope, and nller bean. tadte is like a S’more, i know i’ve used this comparison before, but this is more of a fudge covered S’more! vanilla is around in this and does not make a vanilla lover sad. but the vanilla is more of an accent here, not a leading character. vanilla is noticeable and most dominant in the finisdh. this is an incredibly sweet, and chocolately beer. thick, and it makes me happy.

Greif;Pécs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pécsi Sörfözde;No 776 Rated: 25.07.2009 Can 500 ml, ratet ib Bogacs, Hungary. Appearance: Pours pale golden, weakly carbonated and with sediments floating in the body texture, head is snowy white, initially medium, slowly decreasing to small, foamy to frothy, leaving some lacing, unstable and quickly changing. Aroma: Very weak aroma mainly denoting watered down and cooked corn grains, dull, again overcooked corn, no hops, no malt, no yeast, no alcohol, non-impressive, graphite. Flavour: Drinking this beer is like drinking mineral water with a drop of regular light lager working only for appearance impression (unfortunately pale golden), slightly salty, notes of cooked corn soup, preety unimpressive, dull, boring, totally without charcater but not negative. Finish duration is short. Palate: Body is light, texture is watery, carbonation on palate is moderate, finish feel is watery, neutral and in fact totally non-existant.
Greif;Pécs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pécsi Sörfözde;Canned(500ml). -Pale yellow coloured, medium sized white head, few streams of carbonation, neutral nose. The closest description goes like this: water with dust. Dryish finish. Awful.
Greif;Pécs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pécsi Sörfözde;Can, purchased somewhere in Budapest. Poured a dull shiny yellow body with a big white head that went away fast. No, absolutely no aroma, Ogi sensed something sour, but I simply couldn’t sense anything. Taste? ancient dust with a touch of grain, extremely light acidity. Soft mouthfeel because it’s so watery but bordering on disgusting. 1.1 is WAY more than it deserves. Pécsi probably hit a new low with this one.
Greif;Pécs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pécsi Sörfözde;Canned. Thx rickgordon Pale yellow with a brief, white head. Artificial sour aroma. Very thin and watery. Flavour from plastered walls and chalk.

Extremely thin in body with a light touch of honey pastilles. Gypsum is also present, but that is more than you can say about other flavour sensations, which are totally non-existing. No bitterness either.

Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;Location: Draft at the brewpub, 10/22/14 Aroma: It has a clean malt aroma, some caramel, grainy notes, and a little grass Appearance: Pours a glowing reddish-orange with a thick, a lasting off-white head, and plus lace Flavor: The flavor is a little sweet, clean and malty, with a nice, balancing, light bitterness Palate: It has a light-medium body, easy drinking, with a clean feel, and a lively carbonation Overall Impression: I thought this was a pretty nice, clean example of the style. The nose is a little thin, but not bad at all. It leans malty, but there’s enough of that grassy German hop flavor to provide some balance. It is pretty clean and easy drinking despite a higher than average carbonation. Not an amazing beer, but at over 7% it is very quaffable.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;Growler filled at the brewpub and consumed a couple of days later. Pours a lightly hazed deep gold with a moderate yellow-white head that lasted through the first third of the glass and left partial lace. Mild aroma of malt with a trace of German hops. The flavor is thankfully more distinguishable with malt, light fruit sweetness, and a bit of lightly toasted white bread. Quite pleasant actually. Mild bitterness accompanied by some residual sweetness at the finish which lingers briefly beyond the swallow. Soft on the palate. Enjoyable.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;Pours reddish brown with white head. Aroma is all malt, toasty caramel. Very very similar to the amber marzen, distinguisged by a little thixker mouthfeel.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;On tap at the Brewpub. Pours a pale orange amber color with white head. Sweet caramel taste with slight bitters. Decent.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;Standard Marzen. The aroma was malty, caramel, noble hops. The appearance was a slightly hazy amber/red. white head. The flavor was caramel, noble hops. The finish is sweet, caramel, brown sugar, noble hop bittering kicking in after a few seconds. Medium in body. Not bad, hardy exceptional. Fairly standard offering. Thought I could expect more in a Marzen from a Brew Haus.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at the Brewpub: They must change the recipe for this every year. This did not at all seem like an Oktoberfest. Pours a deep hazy amber with a dense off white head. There’s a lot of American hops in the nose. Fruity with lots of zesty citrus (this is definite an American Ale) Has some bready malt undertones, but it’s mainly an orange-rind bouquet. Has a nice creamy feel with a crisp and well hopped flavor. Lots of American hop notes with zesty citrus backed by a soft toasted malt back (which becomes more evident as it warms) Fairly earthy and twiggy throughout, with slightly peppery/earthy American hop notes into the finish. This beer threw me off because it’s supposed to be an Oktoberfest, which it is not, but it’s a decent, well hopped American Ale. I rated it considering style to an extent, but didn’t let that take away too many points because it’s a pretty solid ’beer’, not ’Oktoberfest’.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;Murky orange beer - very strong fruity and floral characteristics in the aroma - honey sweetness up front, followed by medium bitterness, then the strong fruitiness comes through, as well as a grainy, almost wheaty flavor - a very non-traditional, but sadly, not very tasty, oktoberfest.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;I wasn’t happy with this one as I had it tonight. It looked good, it smelled okay, and the first taste was so off. I was expecting greatness, but I got a terrible tasting beer. I couldn’t suggest it to anyone.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;Cloudy orange color with a mostly uninspiring head. Aroma had a distinct spice combination to it. Flavor had something of a general fruity/floral aspect to it. All in all it just feels like the flavor gives up too easily, if it had been a little more intense I would have liked it much more.
Black Forest Oktoberfest;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brew Haus;I had it on tap from the Black Haus’s sampler that they offer. This beer wasn’t a knock out, but definitely one of the better beers that they offer.
The Covey Witbier;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy blond color. A normal Wit, but with a sharper spicy character; they say ""coriander and oranges"", I say that it has a clean white pepper taste and some aroma as well. A bit strange but pleasant."
The Covey Witbier;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;"Pours a very light gold, cloudy with a nice white head. Aroma is bitter orange rind with a little lemon. Taste is very heavily spiced for a wit. A mild wheat base with strong white pepper, cardamon, and bitter orange flavors. Hints of honey and maybe even peppermint hide in there somewhere, although overall it remains quite dry. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, remains very drinkable even after a few. Rarely have I ever found a wit this strongly spiced; it may benefit from a little aging just to mellow a little."
The Covey Oktoberfest;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;Smells like soap, nuts, roasted grain, tastes the same, not very descriptive. I am not a huge Oktoberfest fan though.

The Covey Oktoberfest;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;I am glad Jamie decided to brew this beer again. The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the malt, but I also get some fruit characteristics. I am not entirely sure which fruit it is, but I think it is most similar to grapes. The flavor is caramel malt, grapes, grassy hops and some other fruit (possibly cherry and also some apple). Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Oktoberfest, that is very drinkable. The alcohol is perfectly hidden, making this a sessionable beer even at 6.7 percent.
The Covey Oktoberfest;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;"Pours a very cloudy burnt orange, with a nice white-ish head. Aroma has a burnt malt and caramelly quality with a certain kind of ""funk"" that I can only describe as being ""lager-esque."" Hopefully I can describe that better in the future. Taste has those same qualities, but takes on a distinct roastiness in the finish, as well as a subtle fruit quality. Beer feels pretty thick and slightly grainy for the style, but enjoyed that. Worth trying in the DFW area."
The Covey Oktoberfest;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;"Pours a light orange/amber, cloudy and turbid with a creamy off-white head. Aroma is faint, a light toasty malt. Taste is more rich, toasty malt and thin caramel flavors. Flavors are pretty close to the same base malt as the amber with just a touch of light lager fruitiness. It’s not quite to style, especially with the alcohol content and being left unfiltered (called ""Texas style"" by the brewer), but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Mouthfeel is soft with a medium-heavy unfiltered body. On first impression, I might call this a light bock instead. As I said, it’s not very much to style (had to take points off for that) and not suited for O-fest drinking but it did turn out to be an excellent beer."

Red Rock Roggen Rock;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Red Rock Brewing;Enjoyed on tap at Red Rock brewpub. Pours light amber with off-white head. Nose has light caramel and miscellaneous grains. Rye comes through on the palate, although it has a rather thin body and soda-like characteristic - the carbonation just doesn’t seem right. Seems artificially sweet also. Quite watery and drinkable.

Red Rock Smoked Porter;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Porter - Smoked;Red Rock Brewing;"(08/2006. Draft). A tasty beer, more porter than ""smoked"". Definite hints of smokiness up front, resolving quickly into classic porter aromas. Likewise in the taste ... a hit of smoke, that quickly resolves into a smooth, classic porter. Black. Nice head retention. Moderately carbonated. Medium-full bodied, and leaves just a hint of sweetness and residual sugar on the palate after. A nice beer."

Mild hoppy aroma, with a little bit of mineral. Superb lacing. Rich creamy mouthfeel, like a medium pale ale/ cream ale. Flavor is well balanced qualiy barley malt smoothness, combined with rich hops make for a truly outstanding, delicious beverage. Carbonation is on the lighter side but present enough to get a little bit of bite. This beer is perfect in more ways than 4. It’s so flavorul and smooth, yet not too heavy. There is a little bit of cocoa in the finish.
Draught House Red Planet;Austin, Texas, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Draught House Pub & Brewery;Aroma compares to heavily sugared down coffee with some light hops.

Defiant Pilsener;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;served out of a corny keg purchased at the brewery. lightly hazy pale yellow in color with a medium off white head.

Defiant Pilsener;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;My Bottom Line: Spicy hop nobility proffers its delicate citrusy jewels to the straw-hat-wearing, proud malt peasants. A well-crafted soft pils, this is. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam sets into the hazy pale yellow. -Hop flavor moves into grassiness as well, a fine match for the hay/straw maltiness. -Light sulphur is perceivable, fitting nicely with the flavor profile. -A milky cereal sweetness softened up and balanced out the savvy hoppiness. On tap at Tap NY.
Defiant Pilsener;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;Enjoyed at the brewery with the Defiant crew. Smells like freshly cut grass and looked like liquid dandellions. Ironic, considering this is what folks might call lawnmower beer. I had this one while it was still lagering, which explains the slightly sweet taste, but it was still highly drinkable and paired nicely with the pizza I was enjoying. We all noted that as this beer ages (for about another week) it will loose some of the grassy aroma and gain a much dryer and hoppier profile. I can’t wait!
Defiant Pilsener;Pearl River, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Defiant Brewing Company;A well made Pilsner. Yellow with white head. Up front noble hop aroma is complimented by some malt character. The flavor has a very soft malt with minimal bitterness, no where near as sharp as a German Pilsner.

Rock Bottom South Denver Chili Gold Mild & Spicy;Englewood, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Rock Bottom South Denver;"cask at the brewpub. gold body with not much head to speak of once the artificial head decayed. left an oily residue on my glass though. aroma is staight up peppers. reminds me of jalapeno. smells like salsa and corn chips. taste is very mild pepper flavor; green chili, sweet corn tortilla and salsa. interesting beer, not one i’ll order again for a couple of reasons: the sweet corn and vegetable(tomato and cilantro) flavor are a drawback, i don’t like tomato juice, also there is just an ""other"" taste i can’t describe, but bugs me. this just ain’t for me. another reason that only came up an hour after i drank a pint is that it gives me a bit of indigestion."

Bronckhorster Angus Tripel;Rha, Netherlands;Tripel;Bronckhorster Brewing Company;"17-02-2019; bottle; at home (bought somewhere in The Netherlands). Also had as: Oud Zutphens Tripel The looks of the beer are fine. The beer has a slightly dark golden yellow colour. It is quite hazy. The haziness makes the beer look a little dull. On top of the beer some white foam is formed. Foam retention is rather short. A thin drape is left on the beer. It doesn't look bad, but it is not the best looking Abbey Tripel I've ever seen. The aroma of the beer is nice. Malts are simple. They give a bread note. Hops are nice and spicy, together with some herbal notes and also some fruity touches. The main aroma is caused by the yeast aromas. They give some nice fruity notes. There is some nice fresh apple, that goes well with the spiciness of the hops. Some floral notes are also there, a bit of elder flower it reminds me of. Nice. The taste of the beer also in nice. It is a very well balanced beer. The fruitiness of the beer pairs very well with the sweetness of the malts and alcohol and the nice hoppy bitterness. The bitterness isn't to strong, but it is not weak. It is a bitter beer, but the sweets and slight sour fresh fruits bring enough balance to make sure we end up with a very harmonious beer. Nicely done. The palate of the beer is okay. Medium body, smooth texture and medium carbonation. The finish of the beer has nice alcohol warmth, fruity yeast notes and nice dry hoppy bitterness in the end. All in all, it is a very likeable beer. I'm not disappointed by this beer. Nice."

Americas Bourbon Barrel Why Dont We Get Drunk And Brew... Scotch Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Americas Brewpub;Here’s a brew to sit back with and to slowly enjoy. It pours a deep, clear reddish brown and is nearly bereft of head. The aroma begins with a warm Bourbon smell followed closely by rich malts, toffee with some butterscotch, a woodiness blended with peat smoke, and a big whollop of alcohol. Dangerously smooth too drink, the Boubon and Scotch flavors are skillfully blended while the peppery alcohol burns the tongue. A very warming drink with a malty, smokey finish and a cool alcohol burn. Very nice. Treated by Mike Rybinski, brewmaster at America’s Brewpub, Aurora, IL

Saxon White Satin;Batley, West Yorkshire, England;Apple Cider;La Cantina / Saxon Cider;An orange gold coloured still cider. The aroma is of artificial fruits, like the pear drops of old, slightly sour, vinegary, with just a tiny hint of sweet apple and a floral, slightly lavender smell. The taste is quite smooth, and easy drinking! There is the artificial fruit element again, which starts out fairly sour, then mellows into a sweetish finish that fades quite readily on the tongue. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Pisgah Nitro Stout;Black Mountain, North Carolina, United States;Stout - Dry;Pisgah Brewing Company;Draft at source. Nitro. Aroma is deep chocolate with a coffee overtone. Roasty. Taste is less roasty. A touch thin. Seemingly bland. Drinkable but it’s just like, a stout, man. Could use a little more complexity I guess. Ok.

Flossmoor Station Terrys Festbier;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewery on 10/21/2006 at the 2nd monthly meeting of the Chicago Ratebeer group. Thin copper color. No head. Nose is thin with some malts and more caramel. Taste is sharp with dark fruits, cream and yeast. Better than your average oktoberfest.
Flossmoor Station Terrys Festbier;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at Maple Tree Inn, Blue Island, IL. Not much aroma. Slightly hazy body with some lace. Nice brew, although nothing abnormally special. Enjoyable. My rating may be lower than it should based on what I understand may be a beer line cleanliness issue at Maple Tree. If I find it somewhere else in the Chicagoland area before it runs out, I’ll give it another go.
Flossmoor Station Terrys Festbier;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Very attractive pour...hazy golden and rocky white head. Very malt heavy, as per style, with a bisquit/bread/caramel profile. A touch more carbonation than usual and a bit more floral hoppiness, too. Quite a sessionable Octoberfest, just ask Heidi!
Flossmoor Station Terrys Festbier;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"Revised rating from draft. 9/29 This time, I’ve gotten a better pour, and upped my rating a few notches. This one actually seemed nice and clear, good Vienna malt color, and almost still until you sip. Taste is a bit candyish, like a Werther’s. Not as much yeast taste as my previous sample, obviously. Still, very drinkable and enjoyable for a cool autumn night. Draft. 9/25. Rating: 3 Very, very cloudy. I must have gotten the dregs of the keg. Still, I can report that it is very strong in malts; a nice middle ground between pilsener and Vienna. If the cloudiness here is from yeast, at least it doesn’t much affect the taste. Not much to tell about its hop profile, just an equal to the malts, as befits this style. Darn it, I guess I’ll have to have another to recheck its appearance."
Flossmoor Station Terrys Festbier;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Nice pour from the growler, a hazy orange, slightly brown, with a creamy beige head.There was an unusual but seemingly fitting floral bouquet over a sweet, lightly toasted malt aroma. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The sweet malts rightfully took over in the flavor department with just enough herbal bitterness to keep it from getting cloying. Very quaffable. Thanks to MrsFrankenkity and frankenkitty for bringing me a growler when I couldn’t get to the Oktoberfest at Flossmoor Station.
Flossmoor Station Terrys Festbier;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Served as quite a murky amber/sepia under a thickish, ecru head that held steady over the course of the beer. Floral and lagered aroma with a spicy flavor resting on a sweet, malted backbone. Hefty mouthfeel, but not too fat to keep me and my wife from pounding pint after pint at FSRB’s Oktoberfest. Matt thought the finish could do with some additional finishing hops to clean it off the palate, but I thought this was a nice, heavy Märzen that was a perfect respite to a chilly, rainy afternoon. On tap at Flossmoor Station, Flossmoor, IL 60422

Fort Street Black Tie Rye;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Porter;Fort Street Brewery;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark brown color with a finger’s worth of eggshell white foamy head that fell off fairly quick. Some light stringy lace. The aroma had some milk chocolate, light citrus smooth sweet pulp, and some peaches. The flavor leaned towards the sweet side taking the previously mentioned aromas into the aftertaste nicely. Finishes semi-sweet. The feel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt right. Nice smoothness rolling over my tongue. Overall, nice beer, but where was the rye? Maybe I missed the memo and it wasn’t actually supposed to have rye in it.
Fort Street Black Tie Rye;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Porter;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: Big aroma of chocolate, oranges, and peaches. Dark brown with no transparency and a moderate tan head with sporadic lacing. Lots of orange, peach, and as it warms even strawberry. Cafe mocha flavored finished. No detection of rye. Very different for a porter, but tastey.

Azalea Coast Fokker Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours a hazy light gold with a tall head that sticks around for a while. The aroma is tame and slightly musty, though provides some zestiness and wheaty notes. The mouthfeel is light and fairly fizzy, though refreshing. Fokker is pretty clean and has tiny hints at fruity esters and almost something like grapefruit and lemons. Everything is very light, but nicely done especially considering the style.
Azalea Coast Fokker Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;22oz bottle from TJ’s. Been passing on this for a while but decided I wanted a little something after a few drinks at the bars. Probably should have waited for a more sober time to drink this as I wasn’t really into it last night, but I did save some for the morning to remind my palate. Pours a hazy golden orange with a small white head. Nose is lemons, oranges, bready malts, and wheat. Flavor has a lot of citrus and lemons and a distinct tartness for sure but also has a distinct bready malt character that is more evident in the mouthfeel. Must admit this beer is more interesting than I expected. A nice surprise from Azalea. And I probably would never have tried it if it wasn’t for ratebeer. So that says something about why I rate.
Azalea Coast Fokker Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Bomber. Awesome looking bottle with a great, simple design of a 50’s style Marilyn Monroe looking girl. The beer’s a golden copper color, clear, big soapy head that disappears quickly. Very sour, lemony nose with some nice bready malts. I get a hint of sourdough bread, lemons, and sharp carbonation. This brew comes across more like a thin Belgian dubbel than what you’d expect out of a small brewery’s attempt at a usually boring, watery style. This is the best golden or blonde I’ve had to date.
Azalea Coast Fokker Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Draught at some kind of beer festival--not sure, rating very old... Pours yellow with medium head. Aroma is bready, sweet. Flavor is thin, but crisp at end. Some sweet malt flavors. Okay, but not too great.

Azalea Coast Fokker Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Pours a clear straw gold, with a decent fluffy white head. Decent hop aroma, pretty crisp and sharp, with some citrus fruit as well. The flavor was also nicely hopped, mild sharp bitterness with some grapefruit flavors.

Azalea Coast Fokker Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;On tap at a brewfest, pours hazy yellowish, ok head. Lightly fruity taste, also kind of tree bark-y. Ok beer, probably wouldn’t order too many of these.
Fort Street Flowers for the Kaiser;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;IPA;Fort Street Brewery;Cask: dark golden orange, Nice thick head, fades to film/ring. Huge floral kick up front, lavender and plenty of citrus. Flavor again all floral up front, needs a bigger malt presence to balance, some citrus bite towrads the finish. Nice creamy smooth mouthfeel. Lavender becomes a little one-dimensional, but I sort of like it.
Fort Street Flowers for the Kaiser;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;IPA;Fort Street Brewery;Cask: Aroma is loaded with lavender and some light orange. Cloudy orange with a moderate white head with an orange tint. Lots of lavender up front, almost soapy. Moderate citrus hopped finish. Too much lavender starts to wear on me about half way thru the glass.
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;This is a great beer. Pours a dark Amber color. Malty aroma taste is the same with some spice and a light hop finish.
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Growler shared with northropfrye and sam_rates_beer. I can’t believe I haven’t rated this one before. Darkish body, pale head. Malty sweet and spicy taste. Grapes. It’s really fantastic.
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;On tap at Fort Gibraltar for the Poutine Cup. Dark amber-brown pour with a thin tan head. Malty with dark fruit and caramel, a touch of hops. A nice Oktoberfest brew that goes a little beyond without ruining the style.
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;"Really good beer overall! My local liquor store stored it at room temperature for about a week so I don’t know how good that was for it. None the less though, I poured and drank each one out of a hour-glass styled cup (as recommended) and I really enjoyed it. It is a ""light"" for a German style Oktoberfest beer but there is many good options out in western Canada for a good beer of this type. I would suggest getting sometime, also loved the packaging- Makes for a ""fun"" beer!"
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Cinnamon and spice scent, but unfortunately not very pungent. Rather light texture for an oktoberfest, which is sensible given that this is my first lager of this style. Absolutely delectable taste. Malt, very light roast, some minor spice that is certainty present, but not overwhelming, all followed by a tiny bit of hops to present one delicious tasting beer.
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Bottle. Clear medium amber with golden highlights and an average off-white head. Lovely toasted caramel malt structure with just enough hops to offset the sweetness and provide a slight bitter bite to the finish. Delicious!
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Pours a clear reddish amber with a small off white head that leaves some lace. Aroma is nutmeg, malts and some earthiness from the halatauer & perle hops. Taste is a good mouthfull of malts up front finishing with a nice blend of spices and a hint of bitterness. Best oktoberfest I’ve had.
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Slightly hazy copper-amber with a medium head. Aroma is quite malty, with sweet caramel and some interesting earthy/leafy notes. Flavour starts quite sweet, develops with bready notes in the middle, and finishes fairly dry with a hint of cocoa.
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Bottle - Grains, malts and spices on the nose. Actually quite sweet smelling. Dark clear amber with a thin brown head. Bread, grains and malty. Spices are subdued and almost no bitterness. Fairly rich and at 6.6% definitely not something to drink all night.
Half Pints Oktoberfest Lager;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Half Pints Brewing Co.;341ml bottle pours amber in color with a finger of off-white head that dissipates quite quickly leaving a few spots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is caramel and some mild spices and grass. Taste is a big caramel malty sweetness balanced nicely with the grassy hops and spices. Light to medium body with mild carbonation. I found this a little on the sweet side, perhaps I needed some schnitzel and hot mustard to go with it.

La Motte Juillet 50 Blonde Spéciale;Treban, France;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;la Motte Juillet;"Hazy golden-yellow; good, thick yellowish tinted head. Grain, and fresh, grassy hops,... I even smell the hop plants. Even the head betrays already the serious amount of hops used. Dry bitter, virtually no restsweetness; nettles, thyme and other garden herb flavours - nice. Ever so slightly smokey flavour retronasal. Light but not empty, refreshing. Very nice beer, light & refreshing - good one. Why can an Englishman make a good bottled beer on French soil, and not at home?"
Coops IPA;Campbell, California, United States;IPA;Campbell Brewing Company;Tap. Pours cloudy amber with a medium white head and good lacing. Aroma is very piney, with prominent biscuit and caramel malt notes as well. Flavor is the same, light sweet and very bitter.

On tap at Village Draft House in Raleigh, NC. My friend Jen ordered but I couldn’t resist due to the funny name. It tasted like dirty alcoholic soapwater. It looked normal, but taste normal it did not. my friend Jen could barely bring herself to finish it. ""I surrender monkey"" was said many times as we surrendered to its awfulness and couldn’t proceed to drink anymore. Now, thinking about maybe something was up with the tap or we were given a dirty glass but do not surrender and order this beer. try another."

Big Boss Surrender Monkey Farmhouse Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;2007 WBF. This one was terribly disappointing -- Farmhouse ales are generally my favorite overall style. I’m not sure what they were going for, but in my opinion it just didn’t work. Disjointed and lacking depth.

Mild, wheaty nose, some banana. Wheaty flavor, lightly toasty, a touch of funkiness. Grows a bit more saison-like as it warms, with some spicy clove emerging. Odd, but a nice beer.
Big Boss Surrender Monkey Farmhouse Ale;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Boss Brewing Company;Draft at 42nd St Oyster Bar in Raleigh, NC. Poured a clear dark orange brown color. Darker than I had anticipated. Head was thin and off white. Aroma was of subdued clove and alcohol. There was also an occasional whiff stale beer, akin to what the last few drops in the bottom of a bottle smell like after a day or two at room temperature. Dry on the tongue. Flavor was clove/spice dominated with easily perceived alcohol and a bit of banana. There was also a pleasant dash of brown sugar at the end which asserted itself more as the beer warmed. Plenty of alcohol and clove survived well into the finish. Pretty good.

Beer Works Blonde Faith Abbey Ale;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beer Works;tap at Canal St. location - Pours clear gold with a yeasty, lightly fruity aroma.

Warbird Lightning Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Warbird Brewing Company;This draft brew from a restaurant poured a head of foamy finely sized bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a transparent uncarbonated light yellow colored body and an excellent lacing. The weak aroma was astringent straw like and grassy. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The weak flavor contained notes of straw and was astringent. Not one that I would likely buy again.
Warbird Lightning Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Warbird Brewing Company;Draft at Mad Anthony Oktoberfest. White head that mostly diminished, sparse lacing, no visible carbonation, transparent, and a pale yellow hue. Malty and hoppy nose and ditto for the flavor. Tingly and somewhat of a dry mouthfeel. Light body. Just so-so.
Warbird Lightning Ale;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Warbird Brewing Company;tap - Mild aroma with some light malt and hops. The flavor is mostly malt and a little on the grainy side. The body is light and bubbly on the palate and the finish is mildly dry and clean. It’s okay, but bland.
Harpoon Mitis;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Mild Ale;Harpoon Brewery;"Cask, 6/17/06, ABF ’06. Medium clarity in this dark mahogany colored beer, showing some caramel/tan highlights and a smattering of dark grey/beige head that is modestly retained and laces lightly. Mild chocolate and some sticky caramel are quite apparent, with a moderately bitter, baker’s chocolate-like note drying things out quite thoroughly. A glimpse of dark fruits, a hint of soft pale sugars (honey and vanilla) and ending on a graham cracker-like papery-dryness.The cask seemed to suffer the most in mouthfeel and flavor, being not quite thoroughly bright and a bit muddled with yeast. Some fruitiness, almost creating a light tartness, mixes with the darker malts to dry the palate, though there is certainly some residual sweetness, almost a caramel-vanilla-like flavor. The finish gets lightly papery, the flavor seemingly washed out on the end. The watery, loose texture certainly did not help things. With that in mind, the draught sample is a more accurate portrayal of this beer.... Draught (same night). Much more approachable, if somewhat more clean, the higher carbonation levels seem to soak up some of the sweetness and fruitiness, allowing a more accessible, dry chocolate malt nose, more clear and bright. Light graham cracker-like malts sit on the finish, and a touch of fresh, yeast nuttiness overlays the aroma. Hints of cocoa, vanilla and caramel, though much more lean and attenuated, comprise the flavor. Clean, clear presentation on draught displays a very easygoing drinkable nature, with light, but appropriate carbonation and only minimal yeast influences of light fruits. Still papery, somewhat watery (as the style would dictate, being only a 3.7 abv beer) on the finish, it finishes without much fanfare and accomplishes what a mild should; quench your thirst. Fine stuff overall, just too bad the cask wasnt in peak shape. The second best beer to come out of Harpoon brewery (behind triticus)!"
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;500ml bottle from Fire & Ice, Narberth. Pours cloudy orange / copper with a proud white head. Vague malt aroma. Taste is rather weak and a touch watery with a mirage-like maltiness. Pleasant enough but not a lot going on really. Which at 3.0% was probably to be expected.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;Bottle sampled at Björn, thanks. Very short white head. Chrystal clear yellow color. Artificial candy aroma. Sweet taste and caramell taste. No bitterness to balance the sweetness. Low alcohole beer is always hard to make, and this is another example of this.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;Bottle from a delicacy store in Cardiff. It poured a hazy golden liquid with a white head. Strong and malty smell but with a note of rubber that disturbs a bit. The taste is similar to the smell except for the rubber. Very low bitterness, I can hardly feel any bitterness at all. Extremely smooth mouthfeel, like velvet in my mouth. A bit onesided beer but also very easy to drink.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;Bottled. Clear pale golden, minimal head. Sweet and fruity with light body and clean mouthfeel. Very light and shallow. Low bitterness.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;Bottle at thewolf’s Kolding tasting, 15 May 2008. Rather surprised to come to a tasting in Denmark only to see a whole bunch of bottles that I could have bought from the organic food shop at the end of my street at home (but hadn’t). Not much to say about this one really. Pale gold colour with a light haze. Don’t know what the hops are (UK organically grown hops are rather problematic) but there didn’t seem too many of them. Drinkable enough in a featherweight sort of way.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;500ml Bottle conditioned: Not a big fan of this. Watery, weak malt kind of dish-watery beer.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;Bottle from Waitrose. Extremley cloudy with no head smell of sweet hops has a nice flavour of sweet hops.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;50 cL bottle. Pours hazy orange with a small diminished white head. Mild hoppy and fruity aroma with a mild spice note. Mild bitterness and light fruity note in a rather vague blend. A bit watery. Light acidic and bitter finish, thin but also rather dry.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;Bottled. An unclear golden beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet with notes of citrus and hops as well as a light accent of malt. The flavor is sweet with primary notes of yeast, but also light notes of malt and citrus fruits. The body is thin.
Pen-lon Cottage Lambs Gold Light Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Penlon Cottage;Bottle. Low off-white and lasting head. Hazy golden body. Fruity herbal aroma.

Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;"500ml bottle; BBE Mar 2020. Tried to drink it on 27th May 2019. Infected, came out as flat as a witches tit and murky. Drain pour."
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Blimey, you can tell this is small batch stuff, with that pungent yeast aroma. Strong fruity flavours battle out through all of that yeast tangyness, but the malts are kept at bay. Still rather “chewy” despite its thinness. Would like to try it from a cask. 500ml bottle from Treehouse, Aberystwyth.
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Poured a murkey amber despite having been sat a couple of days. This is the second Pen-lon beer I’ve had that has reminded me of my home brew attempts. A little sharp at first before a dry bitter finish with the taste of brewers yeast. Poor.
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Bottle from Coed Y Dinas, Welshpool. Pours cloudy copper, clear malts. Supposed to have a thick fluffy head but I got nothing of the sort. Grassy with some berries, fairly uneventful but drinkable nonetheless.
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Bottled, 500ml from James A Bailey Food Emporium, Llangollen, Wales. Hazy bronze with off white head. Smooth malty flavour with a hint of toffee, caramel. There is a leafy, slightly mouldy type of hop note, yeasty then a hint of fruit, Reasonable.
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Bottle from Björn, thanks. Thick fluffy light brown head. Opaque golden color. Small aroma from light roasted malt and some citrus fruitiness. Big malty taste with a medium body and nice bitterness.
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Bottled. Clear mahogany colour, mid-sized head. Dry and salty with a nutty roastiness. Fairly light bodied with slight notes of berries. Salty finish with low bitterness.
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Bottle. Orange-brown with a big, frothy and sustaining head. Aroma is highly fruity (mainly peach, much less strawberry) and hoppy (resin). Apart from that it is also grainy malty and to a smaller degree earthy, dusty, with some caramel. Full body and quite heavy palate, a bit too heavy that is, which is this beer’s one of two minor flaws. Taste is mainly resiny hops, peachy fruitiness, soft malt, some subtle alcohol astringency, and very subtle toffee that is kept down by the quite intensive and lasting bitterness.which is partly sharp-astringent - which is this beer’s second minor flaw. On the whole, however, this is a very good and recommendable brew, despite the partly disappointing palate.
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Bottle 500ml from Thirst for Beer in Pwllheli (Wales). Ale copper-gold, off-white average head. Aromas of roasted malt, yeast and fruit, touch of licorice. In mouth, the malt and the toffy are supported by spices and hops. The end is drier, always malted with a good herbaceous and resined bitterness.
Pen-lon Cottage Twin Ram India Pale Ale;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Penlon Cottage;Bottled. A red-amber beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma has notes of fruit as well as lighter notes of butter and hops. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt and caramel, leading to a quite bitter finish.
Brockway Saison;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brockway Chophouse;This bottled brew from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were and left behind a softly carbonated light yellow-orange colored body and an excellent lacing. The weak aroma was malty and dough. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a biting aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of malt mild hops mild spice sweet mildly vinous and alcohol. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Brockway Saison;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brockway Chophouse;On tap at Brockway. Poured a clear medium golden with a short white head and some rising carbonation. The aroma found bunches of peppery spices and orange zest over a very lightly-toasted caramel base... banana notes laced through there. The flavor was all spiced up too (white pepper, coriander, and orange zest representing), English toffee, and some floral notes... good, but too focused on the spicage. Medium-bodied with a decent flow.. long spicy finish.
Brockway Saison;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brockway Chophouse;"A misbehavin’ head started outrageous and finally settled on being creamy & off-white above a well-hazed golden/amber body. Big banana upfront with spicing secondary, funkiness apparent and alcohol pulling up the rear. Sweet-tart flavor with high astringence and a bitter finish combine to make me say ""Oooh!"" (at a bar where I don’t know anyone!) Green apple sourness, tart yeast profile, wheat background, mild stickiness, grapeskin upper-palate... well done! A growler of this came home with me and was a nice treat for friends at a Halloween party. On tap at Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL 60067"
Brockway Saison;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Brockway Chophouse;This poured a very hazy straw body with a modest white head. The aroma is fruity with banana and apples, has plenty of soft wheat, also a little soapiness, some mild spices, and a light lemony tartness. Smooth mouthfeel. The flavor reflects the aromas, the tartness kicking up a notch. Pretty refreshing ale. Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL
Pen-lon Cottage Ewes Frolic Lager;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Penlon Cottage;500ml bottle from Fire & Ice, Narberth. Pours hazy gold with good bubbly white head. Clean, balanced Welsh lager. Smooth finish. A real thirst-quencher.
Pen-lon Cottage Ewes Frolic Lager;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Penlon Cottage;Not overly flavoured, gold, clean and a bit under powered as far as the hops are concerned. A bit gassy too. Screams quality though.
Pen-lon Cottage Ewes Frolic Lager;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Penlon Cottage;Bottled. Clear golden, coarse head. Fruity viola aroma. Fairly sweet with clean, rounded mouthfeel. Light-medium bodied. Rather malty. Low bitterness. On the sweet side.

Nice quality."
Pen-lon Cottage Ewes Frolic Lager;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Penlon Cottage;Bottle from Brewer’s Droop, Bristol. Deep gold in colour with no head and slight carbonation. Sweetish, marmalade malts, a touch of leafy hop and bitter finish. As said below, an ale rather than lager, but drinkable enough.
Pen-lon Cottage Ewes Frolic Lager;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Penlon Cottage;Bottle at thewolf’s Kolding tasting, 15 May 2008. Rather surprised to come to a tasting in Denmark only to see a whole bunch of bottles that I could have bought from the organic food shop at the end of my street at home (but hadn’t). Perhaps one might expect this to be a grown up version of the Lambs Gold tasted immediately before. Well, it might have a little bit more weight, as one might expect, but the overall impression is still gold, clean and insubstantial. Perfectly drinkable but seemed underpowered and under-hopped to me. Almost certainly an ale made with lager ingredients rather than a true lager.
Pen-lon Cottage Ewes Frolic Lager;Cardiganshire, Maenygroes, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Penlon Cottage;From the Bottle at Chris O’s 05/08/2009 Hoppy aroma. Golden and slightly pale with some alcohol present. Crisp and bitter malt finish.

Tunnel Shadow Weaver Stout;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);Bottle - dark with initial large tan head, dissipates to frothy top. Pleasant chocolate, roast, and vanilla aroma. Good mouthfeel. Easy drinking, good finish of standard stout - notes of chocolate, vanilla, coffee roast.
Tunnel Shadow Weaver Stout;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);hmm... it has a decent malty coffee aroma and taste I guess, but there’s lots lacking. no head, thin, flat - i like a stout flat, but not this way - does that make sense? i’m not sure it does. It does to me, but I’m not sure if it does to you.
Tunnel Shadow Weaver Stout;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);Cask (gravity dispense) at the Pigs Ear Beer Festival, London on 6 December 2006.

Tunnel Shadow Weaver Stout;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);[Bottle from brewer’s own stand at the Chiltern’s Festival of Food, Great Missenden] Pitch black with a thin-off white head. Oily mouthfeel. Flavour of smokey treacle mixed with cough mixture. Sour plum comes through, almost vinegary at times. Very odd.
Tunnel Shadow Weaver Stout;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);500ml bottle - shared by Mark&Sarah - thanks! Rich black, small head. Slightly sharp palare. A full roast, but not so burnt. Leaves the mouth sticky and needing a good scraping!
Tunnel Shadow Weaver Stout;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);Cloudy dark brown with a small off-white head. Aroma is woody with chocolate and a hint of smoke. Dry, roasted malt chocolate flavour, slightly sour and again with that wood note.
Tunnel Shadow Weaver Stout;Ansley, Warwickshire, England;Stout;Tunnel Brewery (Indian Brewery);BCA. Opaque, near black in colour with a momentary tan head. Aroma of dark chocolate, prunes and roasted malt. Flavour had plenty of chocolate, more roastiness and a hint of salty sourness in the finish. Unusual.

Very lively with a lot of sediment; had to por carefully but sill lost 100ml or so. Poured almost black with a thick creamy white head. Aroma of burnt chocolate and malt. Chocolate and a pronounced bitterness on the swallow. Quite full bodied and a good example of its type."

Rhöner Weizen Kristall;Kaltennordheim, Thuringia, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Rhönbrauerei Dittmar;Das ist das erste Mal, dass mir ein deutsches Bier beim Öffnen deartig stark entgegen sprudelt. Schwach hefig-herber Antrunk mit zunehmender Wässrigkeit. Wenig würzig, die Herbe verlegt sich in den Hintergrund und lässt das Bier weiter in die Wässrigkeit rutschen. Leicht abgestanden zum Ende, die Hefigkeit ist konstant geblieben. Trinkbar. 12/8/8/7/12/8
Rhöner Weizen Kristall;Kaltennordheim, Thuringia, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Rhönbrauerei Dittmar;Bottle 500ml.

Rhöner Weizen Kristall;Kaltennordheim, Thuringia, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Rhönbrauerei Dittmar;Bottle, thx to fonefan. It pours a clear, golden body with a dense, off-white head. Lots of banana in the aroma, some cloves, but nothing more. Lots of aroma for a kristall. The flavor too has lots of banana, a touch of cloves, and is quite sweet. Candy-like. Full-bodied and effervescent. Some bitter notes in the finish, there should be more to deal with the sweetness. A nice kristall, but a mediocre one if it was a hefe. 100813
Rhöner Weizen Kristall;Kaltennordheim, Thuringia, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Rhönbrauerei Dittmar;Bottle. Clear golden colour with a medium white head. Aroma and taste of fruits, wheat and yeast. Nice and refreshing.

Rhöner Weizen Kristall;Kaltennordheim, Thuringia, Germany;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Rhönbrauerei Dittmar;Bottle. Clear golden colour, sparkling. Stable white head. Banana aroma and flavour.

Brockway Cherry Wheat Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Brockway Chophouse;"A creamy white head lasts longer than others have today and laces the glass in a sheet. Body is a slight-hazed golden/amber. Aroma exudes Maraschino extract with light, light hopping beneath. Very creamy mouth with strong cherry flavoring that fades to dishwater and ABV. Friendly enough and on-par with brewpub fruit beers, just don’t get one if you’re hoping to taste ""beer"". On tap at Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL 60067"
Brockway Cherry Wheat Ale;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Brockway Chophouse;I’m rating this higher than I probably should because I love the smell of Maraschino cherries, and that’s what the aroma of this golden, creamy headed ale is. Beyond that, it returns to being an American Wheat, only with fruity cherries added to the flavor mix. It finished on a pip-like, bitter note. Where’d the cherries go? Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL
Brockway Brocktoberfest;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brockway Chophouse;Pours a clear vermillion with an off-white skin. Aroma finds alcohol and fruity citrics alongside sharper Continental hops. Nutty with caramel notes, the flavor gives way to a hint of menthol late. Thin & dry which makes for a nice, clean finish. Wholly sessionable. On tap at Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL 60067
Brockway Brocktoberfest;Palatine, Illinois, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brockway Chophouse;The pour looks promising, a bright orange/copper body with a modest, creamy off-white head. The aroma is full of sweet, rich malts and a little bit of toast. The flavor begins smooth and sweet when mid-way, a huge surge of chewy caramel fills the mouth. It creates an interesting effect that I tried more than a couple of times. The flavor is malt candy sweet. Enjoyable. Brockway Chophouse, Palatine, IL
Phantom Canyon Spruce Ale;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Phantom Canyon Brewing;Darker color, a pretty deep brown. The flavor wasn’t as sprucy as I thought... it didn’t really give you that minty sensation in your mouth. More of a nutty, malty taste to it. But, still a good beer.
Dogfish Head Fed Extra Mild;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;Draft pint at the Rehoboth brewpub. Reddish copper with a filmy head. Only a light aroma, but this comes with a full-on palate of squishy hops. This has the texture and flavor of the cool northwest, with a bit of an alcoholic kick as it warms. Quite fitting for this cold November night on a Delaware beach. (#3176, 11/7/2007)
Dogfish Head Fed Extra Mild;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;On Tap @ the Rehoboth Brewpub. Poured an amber color w/a moderate off white head. Floral Hop aroma. Had a definite hop flavor up front, kind of like a 60 minute, but a little more of an APA finish. Somewhat of a metalic, floral hop taste. I wouldn’t call this brew mild, it’s got a definite bite to it. Long hop finish. Not bad, but I’d just drink a 60 or 90 MInute instead, they have better balance than this one.
Dogfish Head Fed Extra Mild;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Dogfish Head Brewery;On tap at Dogfish Head, Rehoboth Beach location. Orange caramel, off white head. Aroma is apricot, sage, and coriander. Flavor is hops, coriander, citrus, and floral.
Manayunk Coco Loco;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Manayunk Brewing Company;Draft at Manayunk. They bill this as a Belgian brown. Pours hazy medium brown with aroma of candi sugary caramel malt, brown sugar, some banana, and clove. Tastes of caramel malt, brown sugar, candi sugar, figs, banana, and cloves. Very similar to a standard weizenbock, and not bad at all.
Three Rivers Berry Confused;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Draft 6 oz’er at the brewpub: Clear golden with a shade of red tint and very foamy. Nice wild berry aroma, like rooting around in the underbrush. But the flavor comes off much starchier than expected. Tart finish.
Three Rivers Red Mountain;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Draft 6 oz’er at the brewpub. Interesting hybrid stye, not readily categorized. It has the yeastiness f a weizen with the citric twist of an American Pale Ale. Different, but not quite right. Points for adventerous brewing.

Amnesia Copacetic IPA;Washougal, Washington, United States;IPA;Amnesia Brewing;Cloudy orange, light head. Mild citrus nose. Tangerine, grapefruit and orange blossom flavors. Mildly hoppy palate starts off well but leads to a watery finish, makig it feel a bit unbalanced.
Amnesia Copacetic IPA;Washougal, Washington, United States;IPA;Amnesia Brewing;My all time favorite IPA. Low ABV and easy to drink but hoppy and interesting and keeps me coming back for more. Sometimes, when it’s not fresh it is less than perfect but when it’s fresh, DAMN
Amnesia Copacetic IPA;Washougal, Washington, United States;IPA;Amnesia Brewing;DRaught at Amnesia Brewing. From notes. Tasted in tandem with the Desolation IPA. This one is smoother, with less bitterness than Desolation, better mid-palate. Rounded finish. Good combination of Amarillo and Chinook
Amnesia Copacetic IPA;Washougal, Washington, United States;IPA;Amnesia Brewing;On tap at the brewpub in Portland, OR. Pours a cloudy, orange-amber colored body with a finger-width, dense and frothy, beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is orange pines and florals with a sweeter caramel malt backing. Some bread, a few resins, and a light spice. Flavor is similar. Orange and citrusy pines with a good amount of florals and a medium sweet caramel malt backing. Some bread, a light earthy spice, and resins as this finishes dry, moderately bitter, and citrusy with some hints of toast. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a straightforward, but solid IPA. Well hopped with a firm bitterness and a good amount of caramel malts. Not bad.
Amnesia Copacetic IPA;Washougal, Washington, United States;IPA;Amnesia Brewing;Tap at Amnesia, Portland - 07/11/12. Pours a hazy orange/amber colour with an off-white head. Nose comprises pine, caramel malt, bitter grapefruit, tropical fruit tones. Taste follows, very bitter pine, orange pith, bitter grapefruit. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, very bitter in the finish. Decent drop !
Amnesia Copacetic IPA;Washougal, Washington, United States;IPA;Amnesia Brewing;Hazy orange pour with a tight white head. The nose is orangey and a bit fruity. A touch of spice and assertively bittered. Great palate and a bit of wheaty character that adds body. Bright tasting with some lightly tropical character as it warms up. Light for an IPA, but well-constructed.
Carrefour Premium Lager;Massy, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carrefour Marchandises Internationales (CMI);Flesje meegenomen van vakantie in Italië en gedeeld met Benzai op 6-12-15. Bleek gelig helder bier met wit schuim dat snel weg zakt. Aroma is hoppig. Smaak is bitter hoppig. Nasmaak is bitter en plat. Matig vakantie bier.
Carrefour Premium Lager;Massy, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carrefour Marchandises Internationales (CMI);Sampled from bottle shared by Inoven. Clear pale golden color, small white to off-white head. Smell and taste malts, lightly bitter, malt bitter. Low to average body and carbonation.
Carrefour Premium Lager;Massy, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carrefour Marchandises Internationales (CMI);0.66l bottle from carrefour in milan. pours a clear golden with a small quickly disappearing white head and little to no lacing. aroma of corn. sweetish grainy flavour. a hint of bitterness towards the finish. not good.
Carrefour Premium Lager;Massy, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carrefour Marchandises Internationales (CMI);Big bottle with Lager Premium written only. Pours a clear golden color, topped with a medium white head. Mild grainy aroma, almost non-existant. Taste similar. Slight sweetness in the start balanced by a very mild bitterness. Grainy body, very light and watery. A bit metallic in the after. Only drinkable when completely chilled. Not the best effort.
Bell's Ahmeek;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;"One of three beers recently available as part of an ""Experimental Series"" at the Eccentric Cafe. All highlight the characteristics of a single hop, balanced by light, cerealy malts. The bar staff did not know which particular hop was highlighted in each beer, however. This version had a hazy yellow-orange body, topped by a thin to medium off-white head. Light spicy hops aroma with subtle bready malts in the background. Crisp, lightly malted body with bitter spicy hops that lingered on the palate. Tingly, strong carbonation. The hops developed an interesting soapy, peppery characteristic over time that reminded me of Saaz...but I could be way off. In that case, this probably is best not classified as an American Pale Ale, but I’ll leave that for more discerning palates. In any case, this wasn’t particularly impressive."
Bell's Brevort;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;The brewer told me which of the three experimental series had which hops...but I’m sworn to secrecy! I liked this one better than the other two--dark gold but with a tangier citrus and a bolder, sweeter hop flavor with orange notes. Wheaty.
Bell's Brevort;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;Sampler @ Bell’s Eccentric Cafe: Pours a clearish, yellow color, little head, white, lasting. Very wheaty aroma, malt. Extremely malty, acidic, wheaty. More wheaty & acidic than the Melstrand.
Bell's Brevort;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;Draft at brewpub Cafe. Poured hazy pale color with an average fizzy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Light sour citrus aroma. Light to medium body with soft carbonation. Light bitter flavor with a light sweet finish of short duration. Drinkable with little character.
Bell's Brevort;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;"One of three beers recently available as part of an ""Experimental Series"" at the Eccentric Cafe. All highlight the characteristics of a single hop, balanced by light, cerealy malts. The bar staff did not know which particular hop was highlighted in each beer, however. This version was a touch darker than the Ahmeek, pouring a hazy orange color with a thicker off-white head. The hops were light, perfume, and flowery in the aroma. Flavorwise, I prefered this beer to the Ahmeek; the hops variety used is earthier and less bitter/sharp, allowing the light maltiness to breathe a bit. Nice floral, perfumey characteristics. A bubblegummy sweetness develops after a few sips. Another European hops variety, I assume, so this is probably best not classified as an American Pale Ale, either, although it really doesn’t compare to most of the English Pale Ales I’ve sampled. Not bad, but still very plain."
Bell's Seul Choix;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;My least favorite of the three in the series, this one had a distinct grapefruit profile with some funky chemical aroma. Turpentine? Pine-sol? this might have tasted better with some really bold food.
Bell's Seul Choix;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;Sampler @ Bell’s Eccentric Cafe: Pours a clearish, yellow color, little head, white, lasting. Very wheaty aroma, malt. Grapefruit taste, some malt, very grapefruity.
Bell's Seul Choix;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;Draft at brewpub Cafe. Poured hazy pale color with an average frothy white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate sour citrus aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Light bitter flavor with a light bitter finish of moderate duration. Good, but not a standout.
Bell's Seul Choix;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;"One of three beers recently available as part of an ""Experimental Series"" at the Eccentric Cafe. All highlight the characteristics of a single hop, balanced by light, cerealy malts. The bar staff did not know which particular hop was highlighted in each beer, however. This version poured a slightly hazy yellow-orange, with a medium to thick off-white head. Perfumey aroma with light notes of citrus. This uses the most citrusy hops variety of the three experimental beers, still perfumey, but with crisp grapefruit notes. Nothing huge or bitter here, though. A rather bland beer, otherwise. This series is probably of interest to homebrewers looking to increase their grasp of hops varieties, but the lackluster basic recipe lends little excitement to somebody simply wanting to drink good Bell’s beer. Definitely not as interesting as last year’s wheat experiment."
Bier-Bienne 1 (la Bier de Biu);Biel-Bienne, Switzerland;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Augenbrauerei Biel;Bottle at Erzbierschof Monday Club. A bit dusty and murky, some grass. Crisp carbonation over bready light bitter body. Finishes bitter, too. *shrug*
Tarka Tom Noddy;Barnstaple, Devon, England;Mild Ale;Tarka Ales;Bottle, 500ml, bottle conditioned. A cloudy dark ruby colour with a large brown head. Aromas of orange, plum, hops and yeast. A malty, fruity taste with hops, caramel and some alcohol noticable. A slightly sweet, slightly watery, moderately bitter finish. Some sourness becomes evident towards the bottom of the glass. Moderate carbonation. There’s something good and unique about the taste that I can’t put my finger on. I liked it.
Brewerkz Fruitbrewz Cherry;Singapore, Singapore;Flavored - Fruit;Brewerkz;Sampler at Brewerkz. Hazy orange colour, thin white head. Aroma of malt and grain. Flavour is light sweet, grain, hint of sweet cherry and almonds. Grainy finish. Light bodied. Bad stuff.
Brewerkz Fruitbrewz Cherry;Singapore, Singapore;Flavored - Fruit;Brewerkz;Draught at Brewerkz, Singapore. Appears ruby with a medium white head. Aroma and flavour of sweet cherry candy. A very artificial taste and presence. It’s fizzy on the palate too. A touch of sourness in the finish.
Brewerkz Fruitbrewz Cherry;Singapore, Singapore;Flavored - Fruit;Brewerkz;Reddish orange with small head of foam. Cherry scents dominate the aroma. Light malt presence with heavy sour sweet cherry flavour. Although sweet and sour, the balance is nice. Manifestly produced using cherry extract or syrup in my view but, the taste is not artificial at all. Great level of carbonation. Light bodied and very refreshing. Hardly any spice element, which is fine by me. The hop complexion is low and the brew is hardly bitter. However, I think the level of hoppiness is appropriate for this style of beer. Leaves a good impression despite slightly dry finish.
Brewerkz Fruitbrewz Cherry;Singapore, Singapore;Flavored - Fruit;Brewerkz;"Draught at the brewpub Hazy amber color. Smells a bit like a beer left from the previois day. It tastes like a dry but pleasant Ale, with some good hops; the fruitness is almost impossible to detect, and unfortunately there is too much tannic bitterness. Unbalanced flavors."
Brewerkz Fruitbrewz Cherry;Singapore, Singapore;Flavored - Fruit;Brewerkz;Fruit beers are a regular fixture at this Singaporean brewpub but I can’t say this impressed. It tastes like the wheat beer laced with cherry essence but I’m happy to be corrected if that’s wrong. In the glass it’s a hazy unfiltered copper with a tawny glint. The aroma is very similar to the Wheat Beer with very little cherry presence. It’s not particularly fruity and remained muddy and ill-defined as it warmed. Thin body, moderate carbonation. There are clove notes, similar to the Wheat, and a thin chemical cherry note. Acidic finish. (Draught at brewpub)
Williams Brothers Merchant City Festivale;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);To start with i thought this would just be williams red but not so. Aroma gives grassy hops, caramel, and is lightly floural. Taste has quite a malty base, sweetish, with grassy bittering hops, dry finish.
Williams Brothers Autumn Ale;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);A malty red ale, floural, honey, buttery, caramel, peppery at times and well balanced, great mouthfeel though nearly flat. Poured straight from the cask on the bar top at Blackfriers Merchant City Festival 2006.
Heartland Honey Wheat;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;From tap at the Midtown location. Piurs hazy orange with a small white head. Aroma is mild estery and fruity. Mild butterish, caramelish and sweet. Light bitter and vague fruity into the finish.
Heartland Honey Wheat;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;On tap at Union Square. Color is a hazy honey yellow color with little head. Aroma is very sweet and penetrating and is a mix of citrus, hops, honey, and toasted almonds- very pleasant. Taste is lightly sweet and balanced. Palate is light but full- much more than you would expect from Heatland. Good beer to drink all night long.
Heartland Honey Wheat;Brooklyn, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenpoint Beer Works;Light hazy gold, white creamy head. Nose held tones of soured orange, corn, and hints of bread. Flavor unfortunately is one in the same. Light bodied, soft carbonation, citric finish. Not terrible, but really needs some work too...
Genesis Premium Pils;Athens, Greece;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Pours clear and light golden-yellow in color. A small, fizzy, white head is quickly fleeting and leaves virtually no lacing behind. The aroma shows cereal grains, stale corny malts, doughy yeast, and traces of floral hops. Flavors, too, are based on overly sweet corn malts, again tasting stale and lackluster across the board. Light bodied and moderately carbonated, it basically drinks like a cheap pale lager. Not good at all.
Genesis Premium Pils;Athens, Greece;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);0,5lt Bottle. Light yellow color with a medium white head.Malty and hoppy aromas nad taste. Richer taste and much hoppier than their lager. Refreshing and good in accompanying meals, especially during the hot greek summer.
Genesis Premium Pils;Athens, Greece;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Bottle bought in Athens. Not bad at all, light, with a crisp bite. Too bad there is a flavor element that reminds me of artificial sweetener, but it is not too dominating.
Genesis Premium Pils;Athens, Greece;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Draught at a Thessaloniki wine expo. Pours light yellow with a moderate white head. Aroma is light malt and hops with some skunkiness. Flavor is the same. Maybe I got a bad batch, though that’d be odd since it was their own promo staff serving it from kegs at the tasting. Basically a slightly hoppier version of their lager imo.
Genesis Premium Pils;Athens, Greece;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Olympic Brewery, Ritsona - Euboea (Carlsberg);Light maltiness with a moderate hops that gives a good dry bitterness. Average fizzy head, white but no lacing. Light, clear and sparkling body, on the yellowish side. Finishes with an average and moderate bitterness. A very good pils produced in Greece.
Back Street Procrastinator Doppelbock;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);This beer has a great color...dark cherry. hint of chocolate aroma with a semi dry aftertaste. coffee notes with alcohol finish.
Back Street Procrastinator Doppelbock;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);Dark copper red with creamy white head. Sweet caramel, roasty, and alcolo aroma and taste with a clean finish.
Back Street Procrastinator Doppelbock;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);On tap at the Irvine location. Deep brown, root beer colored pour, lightly transparent, and topped with a thin layer of cream head. Rich, malty aroma of dark caramel, pecan skins, and brown sugar. Thick, full bodied, sticky mouthfeel. My first impression is that its underattenuated some, but that opinion keeps on growing and getting more reinforced as I reach the bottom of my 16oz glass. Most of the malt flavors are clean and rich, but too brown sugary sweet for my tastes. Very caramelly flavors with some deep, dark raisiny notes without crossing the line into the realm of toasty. Nice flavors overall, the the amount of residual sugar left in this one detracts greatly from the drinkability.
Back Street Wheat Naught Bavarian Hefeweizen;Yorba Linda, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Back Street Brewery (Yorba Linda);"On tap at the Irvine location. Very cloudy, goldenrod colored pour with a one-finger head of large bubbled, quickly dissipating white soap. Very yeasty, phenolic aromas with plenty of banana and loads of spice - some sharp clove and herbal tones, and some doughy notes that remind me of sourdough bread. Light bodied, but has a bit of a ""weighty"" feel to it and a soft carbonation. Lots of yeasty, doughy flavors that are similar to the aroma sensation. A bit over phenolic overall, but otherwise OK."
Great Dane Blueberry Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;An excellent wheat beer with a noticeable, but light blueberry flavoring. Clean finish, alcohol flavor well hidden.
Great Dane Blueberry Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;"On tap. Pours a very dull, ugly brownish-yellow with no head or lacing. (Great Dane has far and away the cloudiest, most opaque non-filtered beers I have ever seen.) Aroma is bluebery muffin with clove thrown in for god measure. For all its prominence in the aroma, the blueberry is almost lost in the intense flavor parade. This beer is alarmingly spiciy, with tons of clove and an almost peppery quality up front. Bluebery and citrus tart are in there somewhere. Very unique, earthy, spicy, organic flavor. Good solid mouthfeel for a hefe, medium-thick palate. This was not at all what I was expecting; a very pleasant surprise. I could see this being a love-it-or-hate-it beer."
Great Dane Blueberry Wheat;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Very hazed and buffed goldenrod in color with a beautiful creamy white head and retracting marshmallow lace. Rock candi crusted blueberries roll out the nose, partnering with cloves and strawberry shortcake avec blueberry puree. Plastic squeeze toys and inflatable pool innertubes affirm its carefree status. Yeast strain’s flavor gets in the way of the desired fruitiness this one hoped to achieve. Blueberry angel food cake hits a curtailing lemon chiffon yogurt aristocracy. Sugar encrusted blueberry scones with ground cloves spun in buttercream is a semi-decent attribute. There’s not much hope in getting past the blueberries here. Vanilla combs the meringue and banana, though it barely gets a glimpse of activity. Beet sugar seems to be a major player, and then a touch of gingered apples comes in at the end. Hmph.
Carlyle Lil Loopy;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Carlyle Brewing Company;tap at brewpub-bright orange with a small froathy white head. lightly hoppy nose-flowery, citric with lots of tangerine and orange. light grapefruit as well. smells nice and delicate. crisp hoppy flavors here with very little malt presence. makes a good light hop drink for me due to all the fresh hop flavor here. finish is sweet and hoppy with lingering fresh hop leaves. nice session beer.
Carlyle Bourbon Barrel Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;This poured a jet black body in my glass from which a head never emerged. The aroma has some light Bourbon scents neatly blended with roasted malts, a nutty bitterness, and maybe, just maybe a splash of chocolate. The sweet Bourbon dominates the flavor, barely allowing the roastiness to emerge. Some vanilla and oak are added to the mix. The finish is boozey and sticky. Carlyle Brewing Company, Rockford, IL
Carlyle Bourbon Barrel Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;Draught sample at the brewpub in early October 2006. Opauqe ebony with a thin wisp of lasting head, little in the way of lacing....oaky vanilla notes in the aroma are well balanced with roasty, somewhat burnt chocolate notes, little in the way of alcohol....on the tongue though the bourbon completely takes over, roasty-chocolaty stout characteristics are subdued to the point of invisibility....I like bourbon, so I can enjoy the whiskey-vanilla-corn sweetness of of but it’s way unbalanced and the low carbonation and fairly thick, oily body don’t really help. Interesting, but problematic.
Carlyle Bourbon Barrel Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout;Carlyle Brewing Company;tap at the brewpub-black wit hvery little head and carbonation. Vanilla, whisksy, and light chocolate nose. Vanilla, roast, char and anise on the flavors-im glad the bourbon didn’t mask everything here. the beer still retains its origonal character with an accent of bourbon. pretty tasty. body is lush and silky making the experience that much better. a dose of bourbon heat on the finish. nice effort!
Wye Valley Strange Brew;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Mild Ale;Wye Valley Brewery;Very strange indeed, but ti was too light for being an old one, however the taste suggested so. The colour too.
Carlyle Bourbon Barrel Blueberry Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Carlyle Brewing Company;Draught sample at the brewpub in early October 2006. Quite dark though not pitch-black, with a dark brown head that bubbles quite a bit and then dissipates....blueberries and bourbon-vanilla meld strangely in the nose, an odd funkiness ensues, like rotting fruit in an old barn, but as it warms a fresher quality takes over with sort of a liquor-cream frosting, all in all quite a complex and interesting aroma....alas this suffers much the same fate on the tongue as the regular bourbon stout, just too boozy and unbalanced though in this case the fruit helps kick the flavor up a notch and the berry acids seem to cut the bourbon’s oily sweetness a bit....it works on the whole but would profit from a lighter hand I think.
Carlyle Bourbon Barrel Blueberry Stout;Rockford, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Carlyle Brewing Company;tap at brewpub-black with a nice froathy tan head. bourbon and chocolate abundant in the nose. a little fruit as it warmed. flavors are sweet with light chocolate, bourbon, and light blueberry as it warmed. the blueberry was not all that strong. it may have been before the barrel aging. Light vanilla on the finish. well balanced and well done. Light anise on the finish. I dig!

Edenton Un-Named APA;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Edenton Brewing Company;Had this beer on-tap at Horniblow’s Tavern and took a growler home for myself and a friend coming over this weekend who is just getting into craft beer. Color was a light copper with a robust tan head. Aroma was biscuity with a slight citrus hint. Taste was pronounced malt with mild hop character to balance the brew and no more. I would guess less than 20 IBU’s here. Finish is clean and refreshing with a fleeting sensation of coolness in the back of the throat which was pleasant. This is a good starter ale which I will look to share with the macro-lager masses.
Edenton Un-Named APA;Raleigh, North Carolina, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Edenton Brewing Company;Sampled at the 10th annual Brewgrass festival. After speaking with one of their sales reps, I discovered that one of their offerings at this year’s festival was barreled just in time to bring. As such it was not named yet and had only been released that day. The rep explained that this was meant to be an easy transition into the Pale Ale category for those that were not used to the more biting bitterness of your standard IPA’s. In this task, they were successful. Pours copper and clear with light carbonation and a light wispy head. Very light aroma and is metallic, with light grain and grassy. The flavor is where it is at in this one. I dare to say that this will indeed do a good job of getting people interested in to the world of Pale Ale. Caramel and biscuit malts marked by subtle and well balance citrus and pine hops. There is also a very, very light sweetness. I think you would be fooling yourself not to enjoy the flavor of this one. It is NOT a hop powerhouse, nor is it meant to be. It is exactly what they were shooting for as an intro for non-pale ale drinkers. Medium slick body. Great sessionable brew and one that would do a good job as a crossover beer for macro-drinkers. Great job…..Now, what’s the name??
Lucky Labrador Armadillo IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;tap at the brewpub - Pours copper with a good, hoppy, mildly citrus aroma. The head quickly fades to thin, then lingers to leave some good lacing. The flavor is good and hoppy with decent balance. There’s mild carbonation on the palate and a medium body. The moderately long hops finish is pretty good. This is a very tastey IPA.
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;Rating this one from memory. After trying four of their beers that were absolutely horrid, I tried this one and surprise, it was actually pretty good.
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;Bottle: &nbsp Deep dirty orange, frothy head, sandy in color, fairly nice lacing. &nbsp Looks almost like a cask draw. &nbsp Oh wow, super strong spruce. &nbsp Might be a bit too much. &nbsp Has quite a bit of that herbal aroma that you find in urinal cakes. &nbsp Its pretty darn spicy. &nbsp Decent body, fairly smooth. &nbsp Well, assertive spruce on the finish. &nbsp A bit one dimensional, but at least it wasn’t infected!
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;"Draught at The Lazy Moon Craft Tavern, Port Angeles Muddy light amber color with creamy head. Mild spruce aroma, stronger flavor, with a Rosemary accent; luckily the moderate sweetness balances a bit this herbal character. I’m against such kind of beers, but this is not bad."
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;Draft. Pours cloudy yellow with white head. Nose and taste of spruce, light malt and light peel. Lighter medium body.
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;"Pours a cloudy orange-yellow with no head or for that matter, pine aroma, just very faint hops. Tastes very hoppy indeed, earthy, sour, bitter but nothing that really speaks to me and yells ""pine you clod!"" Thin body, ok carbonation. Drinkable, but high-gravity so not really a sessionable beer. Pine?"
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;@GCBF-on hand pump-pours a retaining thin light tan head and cloudy/hazy gold color. Aroma is a Christmas tree, ? Taste is Christmas tree/pine, orange creamy then malt backbone. Some earthy. Interesting.
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;Cloudy light golden. Threre’s no getting around it so I’ll just say it. This beer smells like ass. Big piney flavour though (big relief) and fruity but more like grape juice. Kind of an odd beer all around.GCBF.
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;(Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival 2007 in Victoria on September 7th, 2007. Thin white head with a yellow body. Nose of pure skunk. Flavour of a rotting peach mixed with tea-bagged hops. So very awful!
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;GCBF so likely the same batch Enniskillen had a few days prior to the fest. And yeah, it was rough. Hazy golden-amber colour. Aroma of bunghole. More than just a little fecal. I still tasted it, though...big spruce, lots of graininess and a rough alcohol finish. I’m going to presume it doesn’t always smell like that.
Peaks Spruce Juice;Port Angeles, Washington, United States;Flavored - Other;Peaks Brewpub;I tasted this beer at the 2007 Great Canadian Beer Festival, in Victoria, BC. I have been frequenting the GCBF for several years and I can say that I have never demanded a refund for a beer that I have tasted until I tasted Peak’s Spruce Juice. I was knocked off my feet by the “aroma,” which I can only describe as my hockey bag filled with sweaty hockey gear that has been fermenting in my truck canopy since the season ended this past spring. I don’t know how the brewmaster got the idea that this beer was drinkable, let alone worth the two tokens they charged for it. I could come up with a more palatable brew if I ran a 10K and squeezed the sweat out of my running gear for fermentation.
Walnut Brewery Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Sample at the brewery. Low fluffy lasting white head. Clear amber body. Sweet malt straw aroma and flavor with bit of caramel, grassy notes. Little hops bitterness, low carbonation and a short finish.
Walnut Brewery Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);On tap @ Walnut. Orange pour with a white head. Toast, grass, and some sweet caramel. Apple, really grainy, and a weird vegetal note. The flavor is sweet toast and grain. Caramel, vegetables, and apple. Light yeast, water, and a green apple and lemon tartness.
Walnut Brewery Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Husky grainy coarse and acidic with distinct Nutrisweet / saccharine flavor (something like sweet rice cakes). Pretty god awful lager. Rice, cereals, vegetables, soil, wet leaves. Lightly sweet, harsh and acidic texture, low to medium bitterness. Red apple esters and corn kernels and metal. Ugh.
Walnut Brewery Oktoberfest;Boulder, Colorado, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Walnut Brewery (Rock Bottom);Draught at Walnut Brewery in Boulder. Clear deep red - no head.

Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Guessing this is strong enough to be an ASA, but whatever it is, it’s not bad. A bit cloyingly sweet, and somewhat boozy, but pleasant.
Big Horse Russian Redneck;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Big Horse Brewing;Big Horse Brewing – January 2010 Strong dark malt and coffee aromas. Lots of alcohol in the flavor this was a big black beer. Good flavors this was so thick with dark malts and hops. Big time beer this was.

Big Horse Russian Redneck;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Big Horse Brewing;Tap at brewery. Deep brown to black colored with a smallish, fast fading tan head. Smattering of lacing. Aroma is choco-bourbon. Nice roasty malt presence with some vanillins and bourbon. Medium to full bodied, softer pleasing carbonation. Taste is of chocolate, light bourbon, coffee and hints of smoke. Really rather pleasant, not overdone with the wood or bourbon. Pretty tasty.
Ballarat Gold Ale;Ballarat, Australia;Pale Ale - American / APA;Phoenix Brewery;Clear golden colour. Sweet malty aroma with cascade citrus character. A little too sweet on the palate. Slightly cloying finish limits the sessionability of this beer.
Hogs Back Autumn Ale;Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask at the George on the Strand, 17/09/13. Clear chestnut brown with a light beige head that soon dissipates. Nose is a little thin, bready malt, orchard fruits, bread dough. Taste comprises light toffee, apple core, summer fruit, bready malts, faint orange flavour. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation a little on the flat side, light bitterness in the finish. Average bitter.
Hogs Back Autumn Ale;Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Ascot Festival 2012. Pours a dark gold colour with a thin white head, aroma is malty and has some fruit, taste is bitter with fruit, with a dry finish.
Hogs Back Autumn Ale;Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;A Mes rate: cask at Baker St ’Sporks Clean gold with a slight brown tinge and a thin off white head. Aroma is malts upfront with a distinct nutty character and some slight floral notes. Flavour is even more nutty. For all the shouting about hops on the pump clip they are barely there in reality. Peanut butter finish is unusual but is never setting the world alight. Seems a little green to me but maybe that’s the idea...
Hogs Back Autumn Ale;Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask handpull at Simple Simons, Canterbury. Copper, thin off white head. Yeast/malt aroma. OK fruit in mouth, bit of polish, some almond nuttiness. Good fruit, strawberry towards the end, bit of spice. Odd mix of flavours. Bit of green apple throughout.
Hogs Back Autumn Ale;Tongham, Surrey, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hogs Back Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Crispin, Wokingham. Golden colour. Fruity sweet malts. Musty yeast. I suppose the musty almost rotting fruit could be slightly autumnal in a damp leafy way but this doesnt complement a light fruity golden ale.
Beer Valley Black Flag Imperial Stout;Ontario, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Valley Brewing Company;I avoid IPAs because they are to bitter and taste gross. This Stout is no different and I will never buy it again. Stout should be bold, rich, thick, malty....that's why a lot of us drink it, not for nasty ass hop flavors.
Beer Valley Black Flag Imperial Stout;Ontario, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Valley Brewing Company;"From Jun 2008 This pours a pitch black with a huge +2 finger head of tan foam. The smell has notes of roasted malt, coffee, and hoppy bitterness. The taste has big roasted malt, coffee, a touch of dark fruit, and a quite big hop profile. In fact, this is a *very* hoppy Imperial Stout. The roasted malt is big too. as is the coffee, but they are having a heck of a time competing with the hops. I think if the hops were calmed down to a lower presence, this would be quite the good example of the style but as is, the hops are just too much. Perhaps some aging would help but as this is my only bottle, I'll leave it to someone else to find out. ;^) It has a nice thickish mouthfeel and the carbonation is light and right for the style. And it *is* one heck of a looker in the glass. Lots of lacing and the head retention is awesome. I'm very glad I got to try it but I probably won't seek it out again."
Beer Valley Black Flag Imperial Stout;Ontario, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Valley Brewing Company;Sampled at GTBF 2006: Jet black, creamy brown head. Fairly fruity nose. Big preserved fruit notes. Medium body, chewy thick (but not nasty like the slogan claims). Fruity aftertaste. Bought the awesome T-shirt.
Beer Valley Black Flag Imperial Stout;Ontario, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Valley Brewing Company;Bottle sample at a tasting at Tom’s place. Thanks Tom. Black with a tan head. Roasty, a little coconut, a little nutty aroma. Bitter, roasty and a little dry taste. Bitter finish with a hint of cayenne pepper. full body.
Beer Valley Black Flag Imperial Stout;Ontario, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Valley Brewing Company;Bottle. Pitch black, nice light brown head.

Beer Valley Black Flag Imperial Stout;Ontario, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Valley Brewing Company;Pours dark/black With small beige head. Roasted aroma and coffee. Bitter taste of coffee, quite bitter, and dark chocolate, with bitter yet pleasent finish. Mild carbonation with a creamy texture.
Beer Valley Black Flag Imperial Stout;Ontario, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Beer Valley Brewing Company;Beautiful nougat colored foam and a delicate aroma of hard toasted / roasted malt with distinct mocha tones. The flavor is cold coffee with a slightly burnt character. Lots of heavy malt body and only a slight discrete alcohol taste held down by coffee, roasted malt and a moderate hoppy bitterness. It’s a really nice imperial, but unfortunately the little anonymous in the amount of Imperial Stouts. It lacks just a little special character to step out of the crowd, and a well-tempered Limfjords Porter from Thisted in Denmark could easily have done it as well.
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Pours a clear orange amber colour with a small loose white head. A sweet malt biscuit aroma with some caramel and ripe fruit. Moderately sweet, caramel, grainy biscuit malt taste with a citrusy hop bitterness in the finish. Nice.
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Cask @Tree Folk’s (Rome). Pours golden with a fine and creamy foam.

Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;"Cask at the Rose and Crown, Sandhurst. Straw in colour with a loose white head; citrus aroma with some grain in the background; citrusy, grainy taste - certainly rye; and a dry bisucity finish with some lingering mandarins. Pleasant and easy drinking, unlike wome rye beers I’ve tried."
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Cask at The Eagle, Battersea on 13 March 2014. Poured a clear copper colour with a dense, white head. Aroma of apricot, grassy hop and caramel. Initial flavours of rye, cereal and tropical fruit. Finish was progressively bitter, dry grains, hop resin and mild spice.
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Gravity at Battersea Beer Festival 2013. A golden coloured beer. Quite a grainy mouthfeel, some sort of unusual funky flavour which I guess came from the rye but not quite sure what it was. Reasonable bitter hop finish, decent taste but somehow nondescript. I slightly irrationally didn’t quite get this beer.
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Cask at Bree Louise. Very clear amber colour with small white bubbly head Aroma is very grainy and a bit stinky. Quite thin. Taste is grainy, malty. Finish is a more sweet and less skunky.
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Cask gravity @ Battersea BF 2012. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Has a fruity malty grainy caramel aroma. Fruity malty grainy rye and caramel flavor. Has a fruity malty caramel finish.
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Amber color with a small white head. Smells of caramel, some lemon zest, some shortbread. The taste is initially a bit sweet and acidic, a bit of butterscotch. The finish is dry, mildly bitter. Light/medium body. Subtle carbonation. Well constructed but ultimately forgettable bitter!
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Cask at the Magpie in Brentford, light copper with a fast settling white head, a little caramel and peach on the nose, crisp and peppery on the palate with sweetness and a little fruit in the mid-body then turning dryish and with a bitter tang.
Downton Rye Smile;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Casked. Pale copper coloured, bubbly head, which vanishes quite quickly. Vegetables, caramel malts as well as slight hoppyness in aroma. Grassy and hoppy flavour with some sweet caramellish malts in it. Quite wellbalanced. Rather thin.
La Motte Juillet Ambrée;Treban, France;Pale Ale - English;la Motte Juillet;33cl bottle at our holiday home in France. Somewhat pale amber brown with a medium slightly off-white head. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Medium sweet and bitter tones. Malts, hops, yeast, caramel and tropical fruits. A tasty malty brew.
La Motte Juillet Ambrée;Treban, France;Pale Ale - English;la Motte Juillet;Poured a hazy amber color with a thin off-white head. The aroma was sweet with a tartness to it. Notes of tea leaf and sweaty. Mildly tart flavor with a mild fruity malt. Light-medium body.
La Motte Juillet Ambrée;Treban, France;Pale Ale - English;la Motte Juillet;English pale ale? - What? - leave it to the French, man - anyway, thanks to JoeMcPhee for sharing this - murky amber - semi-sour, dank, earthy, basement-ish aroma - some biscuity maltiness and a light fruity character - slight sourness and a bit of funk on top of some mild malt sweetness - a little doughy in the finish, as well as some fruit skin components - tastes infected, but it’s not completely awful.
La Motte Juillet Ambrée;Treban, France;Pale Ale - English;la Motte Juillet;Bottle. Deep amber beer with a sticky tan head. Aroma is lightly sweet with a cobwebby sort of dusty aroma. Flavour is sweet and a little bit caramelly. Chewy and sweet with a soft herbal hoppiness. It’s got a bit of diacetyl and a sort of slick/greasy mouthfeel. It’s got some decent components, but it also seems like there is some sort of off-flavour as well. Meh... not all that good.
La Motte Juillet Ambrée;Treban, France;Pale Ale - English;la Motte Juillet;"Bottle from La Cave á Bulles, Paris Hazy amber color; big head; traces of yeast below the cap. It has a very nice, aggressive, aroma of English hops, earthy, grassy, tannic and a bit citrusy. It has a good flavor of caramel, with a rather dry and harsh mouthfeel; it has also a strong and quality bitterness, with a citrus touch, and some yeast. Long final. Very good."
La Motte Juillet Ambrée;Treban, France;Pale Ale - English;la Motte Juillet;"Hazy amber beer; good, thick yelllowish head as from eggcake, leaving rings of lace. Grapey hops, garden herbs, lunaria, ""citric"",... Faint malty undertones, but the hops remain sovereign. Hoppy bitterness with both a caramelly, non-sweet underslung and a sharp, metallic finish. Here, the bittering hops have taken precedence too forcifully. I think that the use of more USA or NZ-originated hops, might have made a less metallic note and better balance. Not very full bodied, refreshing, nearly tart in the end. Still, a very agreable beer, but despite its modest ABV, not really a quaffing ale."
Kalt-Loch Bräu Fränkisches Landbier Dunkel;Miltenberg, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Kalt-Loch Bräu;Tap at Kalt-Loch-Bräu in Miltenberg - seems to be the only beer left of this brewery. dark brown color, off-white head. dark malts, medium sweetness. rather dry. okay.

Geruchlich zeigt sich ein süßmalziges, würziges Aroma. Der Antrunk erfolgt malzig, leicht säuerlich, und dezent süß. Der Abgang wird karamelliger, dennoch bleibts relativ süß.

Kalt-Loch Bräu Fränkisches Landbier Dunkel;Miltenberg, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Kalt-Loch Bräu;bottle. Clear amber-golden colour, mid-sized head. Malty with hints of caramel and roasetd malts. Nice.
Kalt-Loch Bräu Fränkisches Landbier Dunkel;Miltenberg, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Kalt-Loch Bräu;The bottle looks simple, but good. The beer in the glass is dark, almost black, nice head. Starts malty and strong, not too roasty, but quite sourish from the beginning. That makes the beer interesting. Also some notes of caramel and coffee. Well balanced and very drinkable. A great beer!
Kalt-Loch Bräu Fränkisches Landbier Dunkel;Miltenberg, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Kalt-Loch Bräu;50 cL bottle. Pours golden amber with a diminished off-white head. Dried fruity aroma. Flavour is slight chemical but otherwise dried fruity with a roasted malt and chocolate flavour beneath. Ends with dominantly malty tones and not much bitterness.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;30-Jun-07 (22-oz bottle: Purchased 09-Apr-07 for $3.75 at Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) The beer is golden-amber in color and a bit hazy, but since it’s a little under-carbonated, an aggressive pour is required to yield half an inch of off-white head. A really earthy hop aroma with a hint of vegetal in the nose, but the caramely malt offers nice balance. On the palate, the beer has an earthy hop profile with a bit of resiny bitterness in the finish, and the malts are sweet and fairly caramely. It’s more balanced than the Summit Hop IPA and over time, it shows interesting progression from earthy hop and caramely malt to a more bitter and resiny hop character. Medium in body with medium-minus carbonation. Spotty lacing is tightly packed, but some curtaining effect is visible as well. Overall, nice balance here, and it shows off the hops very well. Good, but not a repeat purchase.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Pours amber with a thin white head. Smells of pine resin, pepper. Tastes bitter and dry. Not balanced at all.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Pours a translucent yellow/gold. The head is 1-2 finger creamy light yellow. The aroma has many off characters, peanut shells, band aid, some bitterness is apparent. The flavor shows peanut hulls, mild bitterness, some sweetness, off flavors. Thin mildly biter palate.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;2006. 100% Colombus hops edition. Pours a fairly dark amber with some mahogany highlights and a fairly thin head. Hop aroma was fresh and earthy but not too assertive. Straightforward hops in the flavor as well along with a lot of maltiness. A bit of toasted grain, with some light sweetness. Nice body that finishes clean. A very pleasant beer.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;bomber into tumbler. Weird light honey brown pour (not gross, but not appealing for an IPA), hazy, but with a big white head that provided great lacing. Aroma is primarily of fresh pine hops and is much more hoppy and pleasant than the flavor, which was almost sour, strangely bitter, and generally out of balance. Medium to light bodied on the palate with a quick finish. Overall: interesting and definitely unique, though not in the best of ways. Not a horrible brew though.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;22 ounce bottle at Belmont Station--Poured a gorgeous orange hue with a decent white top. Pungent wet-dog herbal nose with a biscuity resinous bite. Flavor is immediately an assault on the tongue. Thick, razor-sharp bitterness that lingers on and on. I am fine by that, but it kind of kills any other beer you might drink afterwards. Still, not too shabby.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Bottle and served in standard pint glass: Pours a clean deep golden hue with a large foamy head and outstanding lace upon the glass. The aroma has notes of resiny and herbal hop, wet biscuity grains, dusty yeast esters and a hint of pepper. The taste is bitter and resiny supported by mild pale malts. The finish displays some spice and some soapy off-tone. The mouth feel is moderate lively and refreshing enough, dry metallic finish. Not too shabby and an improvement over the normal IPA but I still think Organic hop are missing that something special.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;This one just showed up from the local BevMo - I liked it. Lits of pine and citrus. Floral, but kind of muted. As they say, a clean bitterness. Unfortunately it has no dankness - which I love in an IPA. This hop is lonely in this ale...and it really shows you how you need the full bouquet of hops to craft the perfect IPA.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;22oz bottle. Pours a cloudy brilliant orange color with a foamy white head that fades to a film on top of the brew and leaves good lace. Smells like peanuts, and like someone said previously, vegetables. Tastes a bit nutty as well. Also tastes like vegetable pulp, you know, stalks and stuff. SOme citrus in there but definitely in the background. Full bodied, nice active carbonation. Not that great. I bought it 2 days ago from BevMo but maybe its not fresh.?.
Bison IPA Single Hop Series - Columbus;Berkeley, California, United States;IPA;Bison Brewing Company;Pours amber, good clarity, with a small white head. Citrus grapefruit nose, a bit herbal, with sweet malts notes alongside. Earthy flavors tend to show up, but don’t last long enough to pay rent due to the big bittering hops that scrape the palate. The hops take on a soapy quality in the finish and show more of their pine and herbal qualities and almost a bit of a dusty flavor.
District ChopHouse Belgian Gold;Washington, Washington DC, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;ChopHouse & Brewery D.C. (Craftworks);golden color with a spice nose (nutmeg, sage). very smooth and relaxing. i can see drinking this beer during the summer months and chllaxin’ with some friends. my 2nd favorite of the day

Coors 1903 Pilsner;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);tap at falling rock. solid german style pils. a bit dry. nice wheat, grain, lemon grass. enjoyable.
Coors 1903 Pilsner;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Draught, Falling Rock. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, cookie), moderately hoppy (flowers, grass), with a strong note of urinal cake. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. The aromatic resemblance to walking up to a men’s room urinal is uncanny (there have only been a few other beers that I’ve found this in, but when it’s there, wow is it striking). Not the urine smell, mind you, but the disinfectant/deodorizer cakes. But don’t get me wrong; I’m not knocking this beer tooooo hard for that. It’s not a bad beer. Too sweet, perhaps, but it’s a huge step up from the rest of the Coors line. Huge."
Coors 1903 Pilsner;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Draft at Falling Rock. Light gold in color with a big, uneven white head. Grains on the nose, but a good variety of oat, straw, grass, and nuttiness. Light palate, not crisp or biting, but a little complicated. Very rustic all around, and natural flavors follow the outline your nose gives you at the beginning of tasting.
Coors 1903 Pilsner;Golden, Colorado, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Coors Brewing Company (Molson Coors);On tap @ Falling Rock poured a clear golden yellow with a lasting white head. Aromas of bread, straw, light citrus and slightly grassy. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of bread, light carmel and earthy hops with a lingering bitter finish. Tastiest Coors product I’ve had!
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;Bottle. Ruby red pour with ring of white bubbles. Sweet and a little fruity. Odd cardboard malt flavor. Light carbonation. Not very enjoyable.
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;This pours a clear copper colour, a finger of foam and good lacing. The smell is of apple sugar and a hint of the hops that they say on the label. Tastes better than it smells to me. Sugary, yes, but it comes across to me as similar to some malt attributes that I have noticed in other non gluten free beers. Apple taste is there and I think it contributes rather than detracts from the overall taste. Very little hint of hops but at this point, it just doesn’t matter. Decent mouthfeel for the lowish abv. Interesting. I’m not sorry that I bought it but there’s little chance of a repurchase despite my not negative review.
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;"Nice amber copper color; Light slightly creamy body; Aroma of malt, floral, & some fruit; Flavor of sweet malt, caramel/honey, fruit, and wheat/grain; Finish is slightly tangy; Not bad for what it is."
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;500 ml. bottle. Pours a clear pale amber with a small biege head. Aroma of fruit, malt(?), and grain(?). Taste is sweet fruit, sugar, and florals. Might be a good gluten free.
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;Probably the best gluten free beer that I have tried - though that is faint praise. +++ Sampled from a 16.9 oz brown bottle this beer poured an orange-caramel color with a medium sized soapy orange-white head that lingered and left decent lacing. The aroma was grainy and dryish with a bit of toffee. The flavor was bitter and tart with vague citrus, a bit of perfume and light notes of toffee and nut. Medium length dryish citrus and toffee finish. Medium body. Ok.
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;Bottle. Medium amber with a flat short lived head. Aroma is caramel, cooked apples, and light corn candy. Caramel flavour, light kirsch, breakfast tea. Medium bitter finish. A bit odd, but not terrible.
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;500ml bottle in a shaker. Pours amber with an off-white head. Aroma of floral hops, light maltiness but nothing really of substance, and tin. Flavor the same. Average texture. A weird beer, but a nice hoppiness.
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;Pours clear, light copper with a quick, soapy, white head. Aroma is nondescript hoppy, honey, sugars.... Taste is light, watery and sweet.....a hint of tea-like bitter. Oddly fruited and artificial. Almost like a canned ice-tea with some alcohol thrown in.(and precious little of that) Very disappointing....as I’m a big fan of this brewer.
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;Pours a one-finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear copper color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hints of sugary nose and flavor is sugary hops and a dry finish. Okay but needs some malt. Pricey at $8.99 for a 500ml bottle from Julio’s Liquors Westborough, Ma.
Hambleton Toleration;Ripon, North Yorkshire, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Hambleton Ales;Pint bottle. This is clear and is tea colored with a bit of copper. A decent two finger head lasts a couple of minutes. This smells like grain and brewers malt. The flavor is also grain and what tastes like rye. There is some fruit that is kind of syrupy and some bitterness that tastes kind of artificial. It is a bit sugary and sorghum is tasted. Despite all of that this isn’t terrible and I give any beer with such a low ABV some lee way.
Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;Aroma is sweet rotting vegetables, chewy candy hops mixed in. Has good clear gold body and okay foam on top. Tastes of sweet hops with white wine hints. Mouthfeel is full and has good oiliness. This is a nice iipa, alcohol is well hidden and flavours are strong but not overbearing.
Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;500ml bottle Hazy orange pour with OK sudsy head. Malty aroma with peach, orange and nectarine notes. Medium bitterness which carries through from start to finish. Along notes of honey & buttery malt. Not bad.
Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;In a night spoilt by big, boisterous IPAs, the Stuntman held his own, but did not dominate. Will have to try again in less testosterone- or hop-filled circumstances
Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;A good hoppy smooth sweet taste. Nothing to write home about but very enjoyable drinking.
Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;On tap at Brother’s Beer. Pours hazy with a mild aroma of pine. Flavour is big pine, funk and grass. Decent.
Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;Pleasant pine aroma in a golden pour. Big hop forward balance with a tasty fruit body and big sustained bitter finish. A nice clean example of the style - but maybe a little one dimensional compared to other local examples (eg. Liberty Citra).

Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;2016-05-09. Crisp dark yellow body with a small creamy beige head. 3+ Aroma is relatively alcoholic, burying the pleasant lemon and citrus hops to a certain extant. Flavour is hoppy, moderate fruit up front gives way to stronger bitterness that follows. Average plus bodied palate, good carbonation. 3+ Okay, the hops don’t quite stand up to the alcohol enough for my liking. 7/3/7/3/13-14 On tap at Hallertau Brewbar, Auckland, NZ.
Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;On tap at brewery. Golden to amber color, hazy liquid, white quickly fading head. Quite sweet, medium bitter. Boring.
Hallertau Stuntman;Riverhead, New Zealand;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;Tried on tap at Fine Wine Delivery Co. Quite a lively beer with some inviting citrus passion fruit flavours, balanced with pine needles and resin. Not over powering for a 8.5% beer, rather easy drinking leaving a pleasant tingle on the side of the tongue.
River City (CA) Brown Ale;Carmichael, California, United States;Brown Ale;River City (CA) Brewing;A nice brown ale with good roast and chocolate notes. Amber/brown color with a decent lasting head. Moderately sweet chocolate and roast make up the flavor profile. A little lingering sweetness in the finish. Nice and drinkable. One of the better brews here.
River City (CA) Brown Ale;Carmichael, California, United States;Brown Ale;River City (CA) Brewing;I wish I could have obtained my infor about this beer, but it was stealthy available only as a cask offering. No description was given or able to be obtained. Cask pint at the brewpub. Lightly malty, chocolate maltiness present in the nose. Slight sweet cocoa aromas make an appearance as well. All in all, a decent brown ale aroma. Transparent dark amber/light mahogany body with a nice, firm off-white head. Nutty, slightly bitter, floral choco-cocoa flavoring. Refreshing and drinkable. Satisfying and falvorful brown ale.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Gold Color with Orange Hue. Off White Head. Bittersweet Very Fresh Smelling Hops. Medium Bodied with a Hazed Hop Mouthfeel. Subtle Pine and Ctirus Notes...Fresh Dry Hop Flavor..with a Light Wet Hop Flavor Also...Light Sweet Malt Taste in the Background, Balancing out the Hop Dominated Flavor..Very Solid and Just Balanced Enough to Enjoy the Fresh Hop Flavors.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Winterfest. Tasty, hoppy mess of a brew! Serious, biting hops in this for sure. Nice tonuge burn! ya!

Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Winterfest 2007...Hazy colored pour. Heavy grapefruit and citrus nose, very enticing. However, for me the goodness kind of stops there. The massive bitterness detracts from this brew and is rough on the palate IMO. I think two hearted uses a lot of centennial hops, but it is much easier to enjoy. Just a little too bitter; which is surprising for a hop head like myself."
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Wow, very very hoppy. Bought a couple of growlers of this,sent one out and enjoyed one with friends. Massive bitter hops with a touch of sweetness that tasted like kiwi.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Lovely orange. Good cream head, dense. A pretty amazing sense of hoppiness, vibrant, attractive aroma. But the flavor is too intense. Incredibly long lasting bitterness. It being on cask added a great dimension that wouldn’t have been there. This pushes hops as far as I’ve seen it, which may or may not be a good thing. (cask at brewpub)
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"22 oz bottle, courtesy of footbalm. I love hops, dont get me wrong, but this one was just rediculous. They certainly aren’t kidding by saying that this beer is ""fresh"", because it actually tasted like a pine tree. Or a sprig of rosemary. I remember years ago, I made a batch of homebrew and I decided I was going to throw in tons of hops.....except, I didnt do any homework and check what would be adequate......the result was a very piney, rough beverage. This one reminded me of that beer."
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sampled draught at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis, October 7 2006. Faintly hazy gold with a thick lasting white head....just massively fresh hoppy nose, lots of citric acidic character but it settles down quickly into something like a grapefruit-creme candy with whiffs of wet spruce, ending up fairly soft, inviting and sweet....until it hits the lips which sense the strongest fresh orange/grapefruit juice texture that they’ve ever experienced, tongue-numbingly acidic and bitter, endlessly continuing through to the long, long finish....thankfully there’s just enough light pale malt to carry through and keep it readily drinkable. Pretty terrific.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;A huge thanks to footbalm for getting this beer to me. Deep golden color, lightly carbonated with tongue biting bitterness, this brew was great w/ spicy thai food. Be forewarned, it’s a bit one sided in its flavor: there isn’t anything in the way of maltiness to balance the hops.So, if you want a hop assault, this one does it nicely.
Town Hall Fresh Hop Ale 2006;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Golden shaded brew with a creamy head. Aroma is sweet, floral, and even seems to boast the ""freshness"" of the centennial hops. Some spicy sensations on the tongue are vegetal like bell pepper. Absolutely bruising in its bitterness and perfect to complement the brisk outdoor winds of fall. A campfire could have made this better as could have a bit of malt to solve its balance issues. So, it’s a good, aggressive brew, but it’s too one-dimensional and not as impressive as the Simcoe or Centennial pale ales."
Hahn Super Dry;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);330ml bottle from Beers of Europe. Pours clear gold with a tall frothy head. Aroma is corn, lemon, minerals, cardboard. Taste is watery AF, malt, cardboard, next to zero bitterness in the finish. Rather sad.
Hahn Super Dry;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Medium white body, clear yellow. Smells like the dirty industrial lubricants at an old oil change station. Flavour is bad sweetness with chemical notes. Watery on the mouth. Awful.

Hahn Super Dry;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Served on a Qantas flight from New Zealand to Australia. The blurb on the can tells of 4 mates who came together to 'Push The Boundaries' and to strive through failures and success to create 'The Best Tasting Beer'. I fear they never made it past the failures. Native North Americans have a description for this type of beer, so do I but mine is unprintable.
Hahn Super Dry;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I created an account just to share with you how woefully tasteless this beer is and how downright disgusted I am that enough people purchase it to ensure its commercial viability.

Hahn Super Dry;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Not bad for what it is if I'm after a cheap carton or schooner at the pub it doesnt let you down in comparison to others in its category. Light flavoured beer nice for a thirst quencher on a flaming hot aussie summers day.
Hahn Super Dry;Camperdown NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Hahn Brewers (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I buy this beer because I am a diabetic and it does not raise my sister level very much.the only.

Wynkoop Ba-Dunkel-Dunk;Denver, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Wynkoop Brewing Company;On tap at the Wynkoop Brewery 9/27/06. Medium brown color, cloudy, thin head. Aroma is dominated by roast--some light banana in the background, maybe a little wheat. Flavor is somewhat stale. Weiss yeast is definitely there, but dominated by roast. A little thin in the body. Overall, not a fan of this one....the recipe needs some work.
La Motte Juillet Solstice dEté;Treban, France;Flavored - Fruit;la Motte Juillet;Short-lived white head over slightly hazy bright orange beer. Fresh, fruity nose with citrus, some hops and a spicey streak, that I cannot pinpoint. I would say coriander, but restrained and more than just that - NO raspberries. Seems some licorice too, but not sweet. Very short impression of (citrussy) acid, but then an oppressive, dull-doughy, neutral taste takes over, prolonged with a dull spiciness. Definitely not their best try. As partially dried-out mandarines. I cannot taste a single raspberry. Light bodied, but oppressive. Well, for once the hops are not stereotypic and imposing - and I end up wishing they were... not to mention my raspberries!
Schnitzer Bräu German Hirse Premium;Offenburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Specialty Grain - Other;Schnitzer Bräu Offenburg;Color amarillo claro, pajizo, sin turbiedad, transparente. Espuma blanca de poco más de un dedo de espesor y escasa retención. Aroma escaso a cereal, heno y ligero limón. Sabor igual más un toque de manzana amarilla, sin amargor, alcohol bien integrado. Textura acuosa. Carbonatación media. Estoy seguro que se puede hacer mejor cerveza con mijo que esto.
Schnitzer Bräu German Hirse Premium;Offenburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Specialty Grain - Other;Schnitzer Bräu Offenburg;"Dieses Bier habe ich vor eingen Jahren in einem Bio-Laden gefunden und gekostet. Damals hat es mich nicht sehr erfreut, da es mch einfach nur ain Vollkornbrot und nicht an Bier erinnerte und mir der klassische Bier-Geschmack fehlte. Heute weiß ich welche Vielfalt ""Bier"" haben kann, weshalb ich es nicht mehr so übel finde. Den Zusatz brotig lasse ich aber stehen, was es aber wieder interessant macht -nicht nur für Allergiker."
Dugges Höststout;Landvetter, Sweden;Stout;Dugges Bryggeri;Draught (Pikkulintu, Helsinki, Svenska Dagar 2006). Very bitter aroma, and taste fills the mouth and lasts a long time. Ginger prominent. Good for any time of year.
Dugges Höststout;Landvetter, Sweden;Stout;Dugges Bryggeri;Draught at SBWF 06 as Höstbryg. I wonder if this is the one. The aroma and flavour are sour, but OK balanced out by some malt.

Dugges Höststout;Landvetter, Sweden;Stout;Dugges Bryggeri;"Draught at Bishop’s Arms Black color; creamy head. Nice and delicate aroma of roasted malt, with Digestive cookies and light hops. Medium-light body, the flavor is basically from the roasted malt, with a touch of acidity deriving. The final is bitter with too much burnt sugar. Not bad, but too monodimensional for me."
Dugges Höststout;Landvetter, Sweden;Stout;Dugges Bryggeri;Draught @ Svenska Dagar, Pikkulintu, Finland. Very sweet aroma of dough and dark... yeast? Almost completely black colour, thick head. Bitter taste of grape fruit. Medium-length finish.

Mickey Finns Miss Saison;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;"Sampler at pub. Lighter yellow than the Belgian I started with, with a thin layer of foam. Malt smell is pretty light, but in the ""refreshing"" range. Taste shows a bit of orange peel and yeast (the beer menu suggests marmalade). Warming alcohol, with just the slightest note of farmhouse funk. I still haven’t pinned down how a saison ""should"" taste, but this one is nice."
Mickey Finns Miss Saison;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;"Draught pint at the brewpub, mid-October 2006. Hazy, bright gold with a large slow-diminishing smooth white head, bit of soft lacing....delicate lemon-spicy (coriander, white pepper) dominated nose also shows touches of vanilla and is backed throughout by a pleasant sweet cookie-dough yeastiness that seems at first too soft but eventually offers a deeper earthiness....body is sweet at first but nice earthy, grainy and mineralic hints show up quickly, iron and sour wheat, sweet orange at the front slowly turning to bitter Seville orange at the dry finish....very full, smoothly and naturally carbonated, obviously unfiltered with a ""rustic"" mouthfeel full of light yeast fleck....the finish on the whole is a bit sharper, hoppier than might be truly authentic but all in all this is a fine example and easily the best beer I’ve had from this brewpub. Well done!"
Three Rivers Blockhead Bock;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Draft @ brewpub. Looks like murky sewage, awful and flat to. Strong bubblegum, funny phenols, and glue. The palate is also like glue. Remember liquid cement? This looks, smells, and tastes like that.
Three Rivers Blockhead Bock;Farmington, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Three Rivers Eatery and Brewhouse;Draft pint at the brewpub. Reddish orange with a sticky top. Yeasty aroma. Alcoholic punch with an orangey aspect. Not as overpowering as you’d expect from 8.5%!

Turtle Mountain Triple Play Pale Ale;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;"Draft pint at the brewpub, 9/19/06: Identical to the IPA, maybe a half shade lighter.

Turtle Mountain Ol Brown Eyes;Rio Rancho, New Mexico, United States;Brown Ale;Turtle Mountain Brewing Company;Draft pint at the brewpub, 9/19/06: Again, zippo for a head. Midnight red.

Capped a disappointing return to TMBC. #2471.

Decent alcohol warmth but can taste some of it as well. Hop flavor shows on the finish. Silky mouthfeel.

Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper red in colour with a thin white head. Slight malt note in the short nose. Thin watery mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt gives a weak maltloaf base with tart redcurrant fruit. Metallic tang of hop resins gives a dry spicy bite to the long aftertaste. Finish is weakly malty and quickly runs out of steam.

Specht Bockbier;Ehrenfriedersdorf, Saxony, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Privatbrauerei Specht;Flasche (MHD: 1/2015) von einem Edeka in Ehrenfriedersdorf. - Rotgold, klar, kurzlebiger Schaum. - In der Nase pappig-süßes Karamelmalz, dahinter schwacher, dumpfer, leicht käsiger Hopfen. - Im Antrunk unsauber limonadige Karamelsüße mit unappetlichen Fehlaromen, die wohl Röstmalz und Frucht darstellen sollen, aber eher an gekochten Kohl und Kindershampoo erinnern. Eher mild rezent. Im Abgang ein wenig käsiger Hopfen, immer noch überlagert von stumpfer Karamelsüße. Schwacher, matt bitterer Nachtrunk. - Scheußliche, fad süße Brühe. Habe nur mit Mühe ein paar Schlucke heruntergekriegt - man will so eine Verkostung ja standhaft durchziehen. Den Rest kriegt der Ausguß. Genug ist genug.

Specht Bockbier;Ehrenfriedersdorf, Saxony, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Privatbrauerei Specht;Frischer, aber schwerer Geruch, der ins metallerne übergeht. Sehr süßer Antrunk mit Malaromen, die Dank der Süße einfach nur störend wirken. Im Mittelteil verstärkt sich das Ganze einfach, der hinzukommende hopfige Teil wird ebenfalls von der Süße erschlagen. Der Nachgeschmack bietet kaum etwas anderes, erst wenn die Süße abflacht erkennt man, dass das Bier durchaus Potenzial hat, die würzigen Teile in Verbindung mit der nun nicht mehr störenden Hopfigkeit haben ihren Reiz. Das wars dann aber auch schon. Die Süße ist in diesem Bier überproportioniert, auch wenn sie eher durch ihre Klebrigkeit als durch ihre Stärke stört.

Medovina Elisa Hromèíkova Mandlová;Nivnice, Czech Republic;Mead;Dalibor Hromcík - Medovina Elisa;From all the different variants of this mead brand I tried, this is perhaps the one I preferred. Not many differences with the others despite the almond evidence on the bottle. You can discern it in the aftertaste but it?s really not that much present. Overall taste is maybe a bit deeper than the others but not by a lot. I had a very positive feeling with all of these, mead lovers should give these a try. Not incredible but very pleasant, beware of the alcohol level though, considering it?s a quite easy to drink mixture ! APPROVED BY TAVERNY?S BLACK METAL CREW!

Medovina Elisa Hromèíkova Mandlová;Nivnice, Czech Republic;Mead;Dalibor Hromcík - Medovina Elisa;Bottle. Smells like candy. Some marzipan and Nerds in the aroma. very sweet mouthfeel, a little sickly and sweet. Too much candy sweetness for my liking.
Medovina Elisa Hromèíkova Mandlová;Nivnice, Czech Republic;Mead;Dalibor Hromcík - Medovina Elisa;Bottle at Kookfest, September 2006. Thanks to Mungo for the bottle. Shame he didn’t take away the remaining 90% of the bottle when he left. This is marzipan city. Rather like the almond essence I remember my mother using for baking years ago. And married most inharmoniously with the underlying gloopy sweet honey. No redeeming acidity to relieve the unremitting, sickly, syrupy character. Even more unfortunately, the flavour and aftertaste lingers interminably on the palate and in the memory. Very nasty indeed. At least a dash mixed with the pint or so of mixed Fullers Vintage left over from the comparative tasting and used as a marinade for pot roast beef provided an interesting culinary use.
Medovina Elisa Hromèíkova Mandlová;Nivnice, Czech Republic;Mead;Dalibor Hromcík - Medovina Elisa;Kookfest 06. Overly sweet with nutty honey flavours and excess alcohol. Not great.

Clean honeypops soaked in skimmed milk golden cream. Hence it’s not the most sparkling nor rustic specimen, its pathos to be located so many supraregional Kellers in the cleanliness of execution, a social-democratic subjugation of ere-catholic provincial character to the benefit of the greater good of Süffigkeit.

Flying Dog Wild Dog Colorado Saison;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flying Dog Brewery;Found this gem at Stateline liquors in Elkton, MD...in late July. Poured into my Chimay chalice. My first review of a retired beer. A- Nearly opaque golden yellow body with a giant frothy white head that takes forever to settle down (which is what is prohibiting it from a 5.0...I couldn’t pour it without it overflowing). It finally settles to a 1 finger thick eggshell white head. Cloudiness is thick and dynamic. When held up to the light bubbles can be seen rising to the top. A truly beautiful beer. S-The smell good but not as potent as the rest of the brew. Mild floral hops tingle the nostril first followed by a fruity scent of pear and apples. T-Upfront is a semi-tart/semi-sweet fruity flavor of pear and apples. This is accented by minimal floral hop flavor and a big bready yeast backbone. The finish has a sudden presence of floral hop bitterness along with a touch of alcohol. What lingers is a hint of floral hops and the bready yeast. P-Medium carbonation and a mouthfeel full of yeast. Its much thicker than others I have tried of this style (which may come with age). Big silky and smooth. O- I really liked this and I wish I would have picked up more than one bottle. I know the other reviews for this are much lower than mine...but maybe all this beer needed was some aging...I’m sure it was much boozier in the beginning. This is a wonderful brew overall and the best I have tried from this brewing co. edit: when sorted high to low...all of the highest ratings are from 2008...just more suggestion that this one needed some aging.

Flying Dog Wild Dog Colorado Saison;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flying Dog Brewery;(bottle - corked & caged 750 ml) Hazy orange pour with very little head or carbonation. Mild spicy and funky aroma with some mild sweetness and spice. Flavor is very dry and earthy. Funky spice flavors move in with a very, very dry and almost damp tasting finish. I think I may have let it sit too long.
La Motte Juillet lArverne Cervoise Noire;Treban, France;Traditional Ale - Other;la Motte Juillet;Intens dark brown beer with a quick disappearing big bubbled head. The smell is like the crust of caramelized apples with hints of sour Greek Yoghurt on top. Soft touches of cinnamon, raisins, wet furniture and bee wax. The body is a bit thin and the beer tastes a little sharper than the nose . Ther are earthy aspects and touches of sour forrest berries (unripe ones), wood, nut peel and black tea. In the afthertaste fresh almonds, caramelized unripe sour apples, buttermilk (watery version) some forrest soil accents and waxed furniture. Agree with honeyed hints in the nose but the beer is to thin and watery to detect any honeyed sweetness in the taste. Is more interesting when it warms up. At a kitchintable in Ursel (East-Flanders) Thanks Joris.
La Motte Juillet lArverne Cervoise Noire;Treban, France;Traditional Ale - Other;la Motte Juillet;Off-white head, small and disparate over near-black beer with a slight red shine. Good little lactic component, as well as dark grains, but not burnt, in the nose. Maybe a bit Maillard? Slight lactic acidity over more classical light stout features (dark grains, this time some roasted barley). Like a cross between a Flemish brown and a stout. There’s some almondy, frangipane streak there too, however not sweet. Carlo talks about caramelised apple juice. Warming up, I get oxydized, warm speculoos. Quite light body, like most beer from this brewery, which does not mean empty. Nice, and a bit surprising. Less sweet than expected, but also less hoppy.

Königsbacher 1689 Traditionsbier “Haus Monreal”;Koblenz, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Koblenzer/Königsbacher (Karlsberg);Flip-top half litre brown bottle, best before 24th April 2008, drank on a wet and windy 31st Jan 2008. Poured into a straight sided Berliner Kindl half litre glass. Amber in colour,clear and very carbonated, bubbles rising swiftly up to the large white foaming head, it looks good to me. Hoppy and yeasty, a lot more aroma than your normal lager/pilsners, they obviously made the stuff with better ingrediants in 1689 than the German producers of today. The flavours are stronger too, no weak girlie tasteless blond feel, this has some umph, its colour aroma and the 5.2% ensure it is a different beast to the breweries standard pilsner (which I also like). This is bitter and unlike any mass produced German pilsner, in short, it has taste. Thicker and more wholesome, this is a truely fine beer and one I will seek it out when in the area of the Mosel and Koblenz.

Embers Grill American Red;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Embers Grill;Had this beer as a cask sample on my first visit to the Grill. hazy red amber. smooth sweet flavorwith a pleasent hop finish. Not alot of alcohol present, was just too enjoyable!
Embers Grill American Red;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Embers Grill;My first cask ale sampling ever occurred at Embers Grill in Alpharetta. The beer was served in a 20 oz. Imperial Pint glass, and looked reddish brown in color with a translucent body. As anticipated the head was small and didn’t last very long. When sniffed, this malty brew displayed an aroma with notes of chocolate, toffee, floral hops, and some orange peel. The taste was sweet with some sour citric complexity. The temperature out off the cask was nicely warm, which allowed the flavors of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and red apples to come across full and rich. Towards the middle of each sip, the hops balanced out the malt, and at the end of the sip dried up the mouth. Lusciously soft and soothing on the tongue, this beer felt quite full bodied and creamy, a lot of which was undoubted resulting from the traditional dispensing method used. The alcohol never felt as high as it was until I finished two pints. This beer felt quite similar to a Belgian Dubbel to me, and was quite easy to gulp down making my first trip to Embers a memorable one. Hope they feature more varied styles on cask soon.

Baird Munich Style Helles;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baird Brewing Co.;Hazy gold liquid. Thin aroma. Sweet flavour and nicely hopped. Light, enjoyable and drinkable. Thanks TimE.
Baird Munich Style Helles;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baird Brewing Co.;Deep golden color. Very little nose, but the German malts are very present. Deep, rich german malts tickle the back of your throat on first sip with strong bready notes. Given the lack of bitterness, I am wondering if this could actually be a Baird beer? Some apples and cherries make a brief appearance, but nothing notable. The body is incredibly smooth. Finishing rich and very mildly sweet. Excellent example of the style.
Baird Red Army Imperial Red;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Strong Ale - American;Baird Brewing Co.;An imperial red for the middle of summer is an interesting choice to say the least. I was really surprised that a lot of the fruit salad character I got with the American Dream was also in here. I didn’t think the hops stood out as much. It certainly was fuller bodied than the American Dream, but did not get me as excited about the beer. I think I would perfer in the winter, but overall it didnt do alot for me.

Sankt Gallen Imperial Chocolate Stout (until 2008);Atsugi-shi, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Sankt Gallen Brewery;On tap at GJBF, Osaka, 2008. A great, flavorful, rich stout. Strong, well roasted, rich and powerful but very well balanced. One of the best Japanese stouts I have had. Very rich and creamy.
Sankt Gallen Imperial Chocolate Stout (until 2008);Atsugi-shi, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Sankt Gallen Brewery;Tried with TimE on tap I think at Towers in Tokyo. First, I think it is wrong to use the word imperial for a 7% beer. Oh well, on the other hand freedom is a good thing. Black color. Very chocolatey in taste and aroma. Dryish (I prefer sweetish). Aroma has some malty notes.
Sankt Gallen Imperial Chocolate Stout (until 2008);Atsugi-shi, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Sankt Gallen Brewery;Bottle from grocery store. Was looking forward to trying this one as Sankt Gallen puts out some fairly good (if not somewhat predictable) beers. Poured a deep dark black with a rocky head. Smell of dark chocolate on the nose, roasted coffee..but overall subdued in the aroma dept. Taste was bitter...wow. more bitter than i was expecting. Something not quite right about this one. I was glad i tried it, but the balance seems somewhat skewed. Maybe I am just missing something. I like bitter beers, but i think that the mouthfeel doesn’t match the taste and the flavours are just not matching up. Not a bad brew by any means...just not sure if this is my idea of an ideal Imperial Stout.
Sankt Gallen Imperial Chocolate Stout (until 2008);Atsugi-shi, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Sankt Gallen Brewery;Tasted @ GJBF Yokohama: Dark black, nice light tan head and nice lacing.

Sankt Gallen Imperial Chocolate Stout (until 2008);Atsugi-shi, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Sankt Gallen Brewery;An excellent brew, but the bitterness prevalent is just a bit too overpowering. Otherwise this is an excellent example of the imperial. Rerate 2009 edition. The bitterness has been toned down and it’s smoother than previous years. very nice
Sankt Gallen Imperial Chocolate Stout (until 2008);Atsugi-shi, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Sankt Gallen Brewery;Poured black with a nice tan head. Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and a little bit of alcohol in the aroma. Flavor was chocolate and roasted malts with some whiskey hidden underneath.

Sankt Gallen Imperial Chocolate Stout (until 2008);Atsugi-shi, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Sankt Gallen Brewery;A lot of hype around this beer.

Santa Fe State Pen Porter;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Porter;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Pours opaque coffee with a thick buff head. Aroma yields roast malt, nutty, semi-sweet chocolate, and a sharp alcohol bite - surprising for something only 6.4%.

Santa Fe Freestyle Pilsner;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Santa Fe Brewing Company;This is just a plain American style rather tasteless blond beer - with perhaps more hops than most of its iik. To say it is a German-like pilsner is absurd in my opinion. It has no body at all. Basically, it tastes like water, alcohol, and hops.
Santa Fe Freestyle Pilsner;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Santa Fe Brewing Company;12floz can, BBD: 04.19.2019, $1.75 unit cost, pint glass. Smells like weeds/wildflowers. Appears a gold color with off white head taste is American, more of a green grass flavor than hay/cereal grain that is more typical for the style. Hoppiness is higher than the typical pills too, but it is mild relatively to other ales. There is a dull dirty tang that lingers. In summer, nothing great. Yet it's fairly light in body and does pass as consumable.
Santa Fe Freestyle Pilsner;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Santa Fe Brewing Company;On tap. Pours a clear light golden color with a small head.

Santa Fe Freestyle Pilsner;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Aroma of mineral and biscuit. Sparkling lace. Flavor is of mild mineral water and floral hops. Neither truly mineraly nor hoppy. Updated 6/18: Flavor notes on point. But 3.0 was too low.
Santa Fe Freestyle Pilsner;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Clear straw hue with only the smallest of white foamy caps. Biscuity german lager nose with a gentle floral grassy tone. Bright crisp flavor that’s got a good dose of Pilsen malt and grassy hops, a fair little bit of a floral tone and a clean lagered crisp finish. Exceptional Pilsner.
Santa Fe Viszolay Belgian;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Pours a clear dark amber with minor head that subsides quick.

Santa Fe Viszolay Belgian;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Santa Fe Brewing Company;On tap @ 1702 for Santa Fe Brewing night - Pours a clear amber color with a thin white head. Faint lacing. Aroma is light esters and toasted malt. Flavor is lightly sweetened malt, faint yeast, and light esters. Medium body. A good beer.
Santa Fe Viszolay Belgian;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Santa Fe Brewing Company;"Sampled at 1702; April 2009 The beer arrives from the tap a clear, dark amber color, it has a touch of brown to it and shows a brilliantly clear, amber hue to it when held up to the light. The beer is pretty light colored overall for something that the brewery describes as a Dubbel. The aroma has a light herbal hop note to it up front, but sweet fruit aromatics quickly sweep that away; notes of plum, red-grapes and a tart-sweet fruit character are easily noticed. There is a touch of malt character towards the finish that provides aromas of biscuit-malt and brown sugar crusted bread. There is a ton of fruit aromatics here, but it comes off as smelling almost more tart than sweet, which is nice. The flavor has a fruitiness to it up front but the finish has a spicy, yeast-driven finish that isn’t the same level as the fruit. The fruit flavors are actually found throughout the flavor profile, even into a lingering note in the finish. There are lots of sweet-tart plum notes, a pretty big berry flavors, some grape like flavors, and even some sweet-tart wine notes. The spicy notes provide flavors of earthy almost coriander, woody pepper and lots of clove notes (that accentuates the sweetness), and perhaps even a touch of allspice. Some toasted grain flavors seem to meld in pretty well with the spiciness here. This is a nicely done beer. It definitely has grown upon me as I work my way through it. I like that it has a light vinous quality to it, but it is definitely fruit dominated, but it does have enough complexity to it to keep interesting."
Santa Fe Viszolay Belgian;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Sampled on tap at 1702 on 4/23/2009. This abbey double pours a medium orange gold color from the tap.

Santa Fe Viszolay Belgian;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Santa Fe Brewing Company;Thanks to Tomthompson89. A funky aroma to this one, an unusual yeast play but not spoiled. The alcohol comes through also on the arma and taste. A bit of laste. A thin mouthfeel and low carbonation. Not really hitting the style, but a kind of Belgian.
Santa Fe Viszolay Belgian;Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States;Dubbel;Santa Fe Brewing Company;nice beer a little odd for a Dubbel, but a intresting beer, slightly yeasty spicy nose. amber golden color with very little head. flavor is kinda odd not really strong but kinda acidic and yeasty with a little malt in the back, drinkable but not amazing.

Rogue Monk Madness;Newport, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rogue Ales;From Mar 2007 Pours from 22oz bottle(room temp) a clear deep amber with a huge billowy head of foam that lingers throughout the session as a solid layer with lacing. A very nice looking brew in my Chimay goblet. The smell is on the light side. I can just detect some roasted and caramel malt. The taste on first sip is of roasted malt, caramel malt, and grain. It's on the sweet side but not overly so. More sips in and there's a bready flavour in there as well and a touch of nuttiness along with a hop bite that is most prevalent in the finish. An interesting tasting American Brown Ale for sure and it's hitting my taste buds in a good way. Oh, and the alcohol is pretty well hidden so this one goes down pretty easily. Bottom line: I like this example of the style and I'd say try it. PS: When I bought this bottle at Wilburs in Ft Collins, because of the name, I thought it was going to be a Belgian style ale...
Rogue Monk Madness;Newport, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rogue Ales;Old rating. Bottle from Old Town. Pours a amber brown color with a big head.

The smooth aroma was brown malt and dark malt. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a biting aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of mild hops dark malt and brown malt. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Loddon Wolf-Bine;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Take-away from cask @ Bitter Virtue, Soton. Initial fruity (sweet citrus) and mild hay hop aromas. Malt simpler than many Loddon beers. Tasty but slightly lacking in bitterness with the malty sweetness growing to dominate the finish.

DuClaw Oak Barrel Aged Berserkr Porter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Porter - Baltic;DuClaw Brewing Company;TITWPD. Brown body with a whispy, tan head. The aroma is oak, molases and chocolate. The flavor is vanilla, chocolate, light roast and caramel. Medium/light body with a slightly thin textrue and a dry finish.
DuClaw Oak Barrel Aged Berserkr Porter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Porter - Baltic;DuClaw Brewing Company;Bottle - TITW Part Deux - Deep brown, bordering black, creamy tan head. Nice tones of chocolale chip cookies, vanilla, and oak, with just the faintest hint of coconut. Flavor was soft with more of the above notes, but add a very faint maple tone to it. Was well balanced throughout, rich, with a light bitterness rounding it out. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, dark chocolate-like finish. Very good stuff, but would have been better suited to be called porter vs. baltic porter. No matter, I dig it! Thanks Jim. Keep up the great work...
DuClaw Oak Barrel Aged Berserkr Porter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Porter - Baltic;DuClaw Brewing Company;Bottle... TITW Part Deux... Maple-colored ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Notes of vanilla, chocolate and wood, but no bourbon, in the aroma. The flavor is malty and rich, but only lightly sweet with a hint of oak and gobs of chocolate chip cookie dough. Full-bodied and creamy with fizzy carbonation. Finishes crisp with a slightly bitter note of dark chocolate. Another strong offering from an already solid lineup of beers at DuClaw! Thanks, scraff & Jim for providing the bottle!
DuClaw Oak Barrel Aged Berserkr Porter;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Porter - Baltic;DuClaw Brewing Company;First sampled from the brewfest in Union Mills, MD on Sept. 30, 2006. The porter has great character in general with generous amounts of roastiness that are exentuated with the oak barrel. Alcohol is definately stronger than the non-aged draft, but is blended well with the aforementioned oak blend. Great Offering!

Pitfield Red Ale;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);500ml Bottle conditioned: a present from my son, the last of four beers from this brewery he gave me earlier this year. Gusher, all over the bloody place, still pouring it’s self all over the draining board even as I write this, some foam got into an Abbot Ale glass tankard at home on 25th Nov 2015. Murky brown with a red hue to the body, the foam a tanned fountain of bubbles. Malty and fairly sweet, a slight bittering in the finish. I might have liked this if it hadn’t erupted all over the dining room tablecloth, making me leap up and rush into the kitchen to drink what was left.
Pitfield Red Ale;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Cask, The Salmon, Leicester. Rusty copper with a cream foam. Aromas are earthy with red berries and wine barrel. Toffee with herbal notes and spices. Some background orange with pine. Flavours are toffee and grapefruit with raspberry. Pithy and dry with earthy notes. A nice fruity ESB.
Pitfield Red Ale;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);"Ruby red, not quite clear. Patchy, light, off-white head. V Light carbonation. Light roasty aroma, with brandy and winey sweetness, fruity alcohol and a bit of vanilla and coke? But the aroma is not very strong, overall. Taste is caramel sweetness, dark fruits, some slight choc and light roast. OK body, but could maybe be a little heavier/fuller. Dry, lingering bitterness; would be nice to have more of the sweet fruity flavours left on the palate. Fairly nice, malty red ale, but the hops are fairly uninteresting and understated. Bit too sweet for the amount of flavour it has."

Pitfield Red Ale;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);Bottle at home shared with Lyoli. Cloudy amber pour with a weak, white head. Strong caramel and toffee notes in the aroma. Interesting flavor, pretty sweet, bready, nutty, some prunes maybe, and leafy bitters. Medium in body with average, fizzy carbonation. Finish is kinda weird too. Not bad, but has some uncommon characteristics. More bread and nuts with some fruits and caramel. Decent.
Pitfield Red Ale;Coggeshall, Essex, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dominion Brewery (prev Pitfield);11th October 2007 Warning! Early amateur rating! Reddish brown ale. A bit monotone! Dry and crisp. Fairly bitter finish. Improved a little by pouring some of the sediment in but overall an average beer.

Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Pours copper with some stray white bubbles. Smells of sweet malt and boozy. Tastes earthy and slightly resiny.
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Lots of sweet in this IPA. Saw it on the shelf while visiting NC and thought I would take a chance. Not munch of an aroma, but overall not a bad IPA. Decent beer. Some of these bad reviews may have received bad bottles.
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;22 oz bottle poured medium orange and cloudy. Decent hop aroma, but not noticeable what was going on. Same sour flavors as in the stout.
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;22oz bottle. Pours orange/amber with a huge, crisp white head, sticky lace. Smells of vinegar and some hay with some hops as well. I smell Brett yeast? Tastes like a lambic as well. A bit of barnyard with some subdued astringent hops, a little sour. Medium body, vibrant carbonation.
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Large tan head, retention is good as is the lace. Clear, orange gold color. Funky nose of scented liquid dish soap, sorta perfumey, light honey notes. Body is med/light, prickly carbonation, astringent feel on the palate. Perumey hop flavors, soapy, metallic notes, light maltiness. Finish is lightly sweet, astringent, errrph. Bottle procured in a trade with oldstylecubfan i do believe? Thanks Todd!
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours hazy brass color with fizzy off-white head. The aroma is lime, orange, and candy apple. The flavor is unpleasantly grassy with some cotton and apple tastes. There’s a weird chemical sweetness toward the finish that’s really turning me off. Some pine bounces around too. Not a particularly tasty IPA.
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Orange copper pour with a creamy white head. Sweet caramel and butterscotch flavors. Grassy hop flavor. IMHO, not a good IPA - even when we tried to compare it to more traditional UK IPAs. Strangely enough my wife, who hates hoppy beers, liked this one.
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;"Bottle; a pretty attractive pour. Color of copper with a big off white head. Aroma was strange; oranges, bread, and caramel with a pronounced sour/tart component. Flavor; probably would never have guessed this was an IPA; probably would have guessed some form of amber ale. Not too hoppy in the finish. That being said, it didn’t really taste all that bad. A little bit of balance and some complexity. Decent beer, just not a great representation of the style."
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;22oz bottle. Golden color. Stale aged aroma. Flavor is blah. Big bitterness in the finish. That’s all this bottle had.
Azalea Coast East Coast India Pale Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Azalea Coast Brewing Company;Bomber. Pours a copper hue with a fairly see-through body. Perhaps the slightest of haze is visible. A decent white head forms and lingers for an extended period of time. The aroma has hints of sourdough, caramel, hot cinnamon candy, and peppers. This isn’t nearly as aromatic as I’d like an IPA. The mouthfeel is lighter, but not watery. All of the flavors meld together awkwardly in a combination that certainly resembles an india pale, though rough. The hops add an acceptable level of bitterness that mostly is noted in an aftersting, but never really shine through. The malt flavor has a very generic personality touted especially in an almost corny/apple-like sweet note. This is not necessarily abysmal as a beer, but does not do well to quell my craving for an IPA.

Foothills Baltic Porter;Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States;Porter - Baltic;Foothills Brewing;I brought this one to our Stout Day party. A - Pours extremely dark brown with a nice one finger tall off white head leaving small streaks of lace down the glass. S - This one is fairly roasty with hints of coffee and chocolate. It has a tiny bit of mineral flavor as well. The smokey charred wood aroma mixes well with the dark roast. T - Starts off with some slightly sweet dark roast quickly giving way to a mix of coffee grounds, dark chocolate, and charred wood. The finish is a mix of dark roast and light smoke, lingering on the pallet for some time. The smooth feel really helps this one out, helping to bring all the flavors together. M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Smooth, roasty, feel throughout. Very little booze flavor in this one. O - I really enjoyed this one. It had plenty of flavor and was easy to drink. One of the better baltic porters I have had recently. I didn’t detect a lot of alcohol in this one, I think the year in the cellar did this one some good.

Great Waters Mad Hatters IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;On tap at George’s in Wayne, PA. Served in a pint glass. Lots of very light, fluffy head. Coloring was a mild yellow-gold. Taste was of hops with a little malt flavor, but not much. Hop flavor was fairly bland, not really piny or citrusy but just the biting hop flavor. Mouthfeel was fairly light, bordering on wattery. All in all, there are a ton of other IPAs out there that are better than this one so I doubt I’d order this again.
Great Waters Mad Hatters IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Bottle. Aroma-Fruity. Appearance-Same as any other IPA. Flavor- About as boring and standard as the semi-gloss paint on a kitchen wall. Palate-Nothing big to mention. This is just an average IPA, with nothing to make it stand apart.
Great Waters Mad Hatters IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;On-tap at the brewpub: Slightly hazed gold with a nice firm capping of white foam about a finger high which keeps its present at length. Lots of sheeting lace is stretched across the glass. Aroma is quite nice of citrusy juices where orange, lemon, and grapefruit collide over a little pineyness and sweet malt backing it up. Crisp, clean, hoppy, and inviting nose. Taste is smooth and clean with a nice citric realm of lemon, orange, and grapefruit taking a nice mildly balanced flavor across the palate. Nice touches of caramel malt and sweetened, piney bitterness grab with just a touch of grassyness. It kinda reminded me a bit of Two-Hearted, but somewhat lighter and not as lengthy. Pretty solid taster though. Very smooth, lightly crisp, and enjoyably drinkable. Body is about medium, smooth and carefully hopped with a nice balance and well rounded clean crispness to its bitterness. A favorable drinking IPA. Its not flashy for an IPA, its a nice hop fix and tasty. Not to mention, super damn drnkable to boot. I had a few these in a hurry as they went down oh so nice.

McMullen IPA;Hertford, Hertfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;McMullen;Cask. Pale amber with a lovely foam head. Scent is nothing. Taste is light boring bitter without hops and hard to believe this is called an IPA. Finish is nothing. Sticky. Poor.

Buntingford Night Owl;Royston, Hertfordshire, England;Porter;Buntingford Brewery;Cask@The Magpie&Crown, Brentford, WLondon. Black colour, brown edges. Aroma is earthy and a little fishy. Don’t actually get too much out of the aroma. This doesn’t really taste that dark. Has some some light sweet caramel and then a minty menthol character, then a fishy character and then some chunder.

Let down mre than anything by the thin mouthfeel

Cest What Hazelnut Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;On nitro tap at C’est What?. Pours a clear black with a thin to medium sized beige head. Very intense aroma redolent with dark roast coffee. Tastes like coffee, only a bit thicker, with some light roast highlights and a big bitterness. Finishes with long roast bitterness.

Cest What Hazelnut Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;Draft at CW. Ruby tinged black body with thick creamy mocha head. Aroma of moch and cold coffee, moderate malt. Very muted hazelnut in aroma. Sweet, nutty coffee-mocha flavour, notes of hazelnut and chocolate round out the bitterness of the cofee and roast malts nicely. Average but quite smooth palate. This is quite tasty, and I much prefer this to the regular version since I am not a coffee lover. I expect I would enjoy this even more if I was.
Cest What Hazelnut Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;Draught at C’est What. Ruby-brown with a medium sized creamy tan head. Aroma is fantastic, like hazelnut coffee laced with some bittersweet cocoa - yum! Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, thanks to the nitro. Flavour of fresh roasted coffee, sweet toasted nuts, and chocolate milk - a little mellower than the aroma suggests, but still very nice.
Cest What Hazelnut Coffee Porter;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Cest What;Draught. Dark brown with lighter edges and a creamy yellow head. The aroma is great - nice hazelnut, vanilla, chocolate, and maple. The flavour is roast and chocolate oriented with toffee and nut flavour - though not as prominent as in the aroma. It thins out to some extent in the finish.

Alehouse Milk & Alcohol;St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England;Stout;Verulam Brewery;Cask at Craft Beer Co. Pours a thick dark brown with a slight beige head. There is a heavy roasted malt and black coffee/dark chocolate aroma to this beer which is very inviting. A touch thin but also creamy and oily on the palate. It has a rich coffee taste and a lingering bitter roast malt aftertaste. A nice beer but a little one-dimensional. Satisfying and certainly not bad it just seems to be lacking another side to its character .

AllGates Young Pretender;Wigan, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wigan Brew House (prev AllGates);Cask. Freshfield Hotel,Formby. Light golden colour with small white head. I’m struggling with both aroma and flavours. Citrus perhaps but also a vey noticeable fllavour which I am finding very hard to identify. Perhaps some grapefruit , more peach possibly but not really sure. Only to say I found it most agreeable. Subsequently drunk again last weekend @ the Freshie and decided taste was very much like Cumberland sausage!

It’s like walking down Southwark Bridge Road near Minstry of Sound on a summer night. Perhaps someone DID have a wee in it. Some people at the table had reached their expiry. Taste is miles better.

Greene King Burton Ale (Bottle);Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Greene King;275ml bottle from Shropshire. Vintage 1990. A little condition left attracting a ring of foam around the glass. A very dark beer. Quite a beefy aroma with some cardboard around the edges. Some cola flavours. More of a mild than an ale.

Amber Pale;Ripley, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Amber Ales;Cask, third pint, early on a Thursday afternoon at GBBF 08. Pours a slightly unclear amber body with a thin, bubbly tophead.

Amber Pale;Ripley, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Amber Ales;A Mes rate: gravicask at GBBF. Clean gold with a vanishing white head. Rather eggy and dull. Faint spice and yeast with some reasonable floral and citric hops in the finish.

Felsenbräu Braune Weisse;Thalmannsfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Felsenbräu Thalmannsfeld;Antrunk schön mild-hefig. Der Hauptteil ist leicht süßlich-malzig, insgesamt aber ziemlich neutral. Im Nachgeschmack kommt noch eine kleine Herbe dazu, auf der Zunge bleibt eine säuerlich-malzig-herbe Note zurück. Das Bier ist schön süffig, aber irgendwie nichts Besonderes.... Test vom 21.5.2008, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 12,11,12,9,12,10 - 10,60

Starts slightly acidic, very pleasant and drinkable. A slightly malty and sour note is noticeable. The further course shows some sweet-malty aromas, also some roasted malts. Successfull Dunkelweizen!
Felsenbräu Braune Weisse;Thalmannsfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Felsenbräu Thalmannsfeld;Screw-cap bottle. Chestnut-amber cpoloured, mid-sized, stable off-white foamy layer. First impression: dark berries in the nose, second impression - when it gets warmer - : wheaty fruitiness with a delicate maltiness underneath. Moderate sweetish-sourish flavour. Light hints of appels in the fruity and wheat-malty finish. Not bad, but tastes nearly like a Hellweizen...............
Felsenbräu Braune Weisse;Thalmannsfeld, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Felsenbräu Thalmannsfeld;Bottle, 5.1%. Sweet malt aroma. Fat banana, perhaps butter, but not bad. Muddy brown colour. Stable tan head. The flavour is sweet and malty, some butter in the good way. High carbonation, slightly citric.

Head is small, creamy, white with fair lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is sparkling clear amber. Flavor is lightly sweet and light to moderately acidic, then finishes lightly bitter. Palate is light to medium, watery and has a soft carbonation. An average tasting beer, I guess true to style for an American Pale Ale.
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;"Didn’t notice this was Gluek or I would not have bought it. I got sucked in by the packaging and price. $5.50 a 4 pack. ""OK"" and drinkable but would not buy again."
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Dark gold body with a slightly off white head. The aroma is like unrisen bread dough a little bit of dandelions. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated. the taste is slightly burnt sweet apple pancakes with some rotting grapefruit. The finish is a little bit citrus, but also earthy sweat. This is not too bad, but I would definitely not try again.
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Found a four-pack box of these on the floor at the Polish market. Pours an amber/copper color. Not much of a head unless you give it a hard pour. Husky grain malt aroma with some fruitgum and a touch of caramel and soap. Cereal/grainy malt flavor with underlying fruity esters and some mild grassy and citrusy hops at the end. Has an overall metallic tone. Medium bodied, little carbonation. Could actually work well if drunk straight from the can at a tailgate or something. Otherwise nothing special.
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Can from BevMo online. Medium golden in color upon pouring. Malty aroma with a splash of hoppiness. A little bit of yeast and root beer as well. Somewhat bready malty flavors up front. Hop character seems a little sour. Tastes more like beer than most Glueks.
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;473ml can (thanks to Joe Sixpack). Slightly hazy, golden brown body under a frothy, white head that slowly fades away. Firm malty aroma. Pale malt flavoured water with a hoppy note. Finish off with a hints of sourish vegetables. Missing tail. Smooth mouthfeel. Not a great drink, but my best n/a so far (15.01.2008).
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Corn malt and a little hops on the nose. Similar taste. By far the best Gluek product I’ve tried.
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Going out on a limb, I didn’t know what to expect with this and figured it would be pretty bad. However, it was actually moderately good. I don’t know baout the bubble blurbon the package, but this did have a very nice, thick, lasting white head that left good lacing, on an amber body. The aroma and taste were mild but definitely present and generally good, with a mild yeats, biscuit aroma. The taste is mild malt, biscuit, a hint of sweetness and a hint of biterrness, generally smooth, drinkable & refreshing if fairly bland.
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;"above average pale ale, very refreshing. very little head. creamy caramel taste with little floral hop bitterness. not sure why they make such a big deal on this being a draught style - ""open the can and millions of tiny bubbles release"" - well, that’s just beer in a can. bought at bev mo in sunnyvale, ca"
Colonial Pub Pints Pale Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Cold Spring Brewery;Poured pretty nice with a thick frothy head. The color was dull amber and opaque. The smell was very malty and sweet--it was hard to detect the hops or ID this as a pale ale. Taste was pretty dry and flat. It wasn’t nearly as malty as it smelled but definitely was primarily caramel and sweet. The palate’s actually pretty good too. This is the best beer I’ve ever had that Gluek made--which isn’t saying much. However, I would drink this again.
Roosters West Coast Pale;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Roosters Brewing;cask delivered by gravity at the Maltings 14th Annual Beer Festival, York: Yellow with a tinge of orange. Initial aroma is dusty earty hops and some toffee. Initial flavor is toffee with eathy hop backround. finished with more dusty hops then toffee. Not impressive
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;A big thanks goes out to CanIHave4Beers for the chance to taste this beer. Brownish hazy brownish orange color. Thin alabaster head. Some choco-malt inthe aromatic volatile sweetish lager aroma. Nice label on this 16 oz can. Almost heller or something in the aroma and taste. Quite beery in every aspect. Finsih is a bit sweet and perhaps not cloying nor syrupy. Not bad overall. Good beer in a can.
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;A little shocked this beer is only ranked in the 10th percentile, I even drank it head to head with Surly Bender and while it pales in comparison to that brew I would not say it is 83 percentage points worse. A little too over carbonated and a strange palate to it, but not a terrible brew all in all.
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Carmel, grape and pear nose. Creamy head dissapears in about a minute. Leaves nice natural lacing. Tastes like t smells. For 4.25 for 4 pints. This aint a bad beer. Best I have had out of the brewery. I will buy again. Nice fridge stuffer.
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"160z can: The whole ""Pub Pints"" angle seems a bit gimmicky. I cut the can open after pouring to look for some sort of ""widget"", but the can is empty. The beer does poor with an initially thick and healthy beige head, but it settles rather quickly as you begin to drink. The nose is sharp, almost tart, with alot of CO2 it seems. Eventually it settles and mild hints of caramel and esthery plum come forth. The body has a nice, creamy mouthfeel and is medium bodied. Notes of sweet caramel, honey and nuts are abound. Easy to drink and finishes just sweet enough to leave me wanting more. I kind of like this for a session brew, although the ""extreme carbing"" ruins the nose. Oh well, still a good drinker."
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"16oz can. Poured clear reddish-orange with a short cap of off-white/beige head. The aroma picked up sour fruit skins with caramel and nutty notes way in the background.. not good. The flavor was also marred by persistent fruit skin sourness and acidity.. caramel and some dark fruity sweetness come through on the back-end, and is almost decent for a split second.. this finishes very metallic, sour, and tacky. Light-bodied with higher carbonation.. sour, ugly, and lingering feel at the end. The worst part may be that being ""light-struck"" is ruled out b/c of the can, and I think this is a fresh batch."
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Can purchased at the New Pioneer Co-Op in Coralville, IA. Dark orange amber body with a light kahki coloredv head. Smells of caramel and hot cream of wheat cereal. The taste has some light toffee and iced black tea. There is just a little bit of pear core in the finish. This is drinkable but certainly not pleasurable.
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Medium head with a huge smell of chocolate and sweet malt. Nice full body and it delivers on the sweet malt and chocolate preview. There is a bit of metallic taste? I could accidently drink too many of these.
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Pours amber with lasting tan head, looks good, smells of alumminum, very sweet, malty and slightly hoppy, this is one of the worst beers i have tasted, the only reason i gave it an overall 5 and not a 1 is because it looks pretty. I had to pour it out have way through.
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;Can poured a clear brown with a small lasting light tan head. Aromas of carmel. chocolate, light fruitiness and a hint of nuts. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of carmel and light fruitiness with a crisp clean finish. A verey disapointing beer!
Colonial Pub Pints Brown Ale;Cold Spring, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Cold Spring Brewery;"22-May-07 (16 oz can: Purchased at BevMo in La Jolla, CA) I was prepared to say, ""This isn’t THAT bad,"" but after just one sip, yes, it really is that bad. When first taking each sip, the beer is lightly sweet, fairly sugary, caramely and somewhat toasty, certainly not great quality here, but its drinkable I suppose. But as soon as I swallow, those flavors disappear and the mediocrity take a hard nosedive. The palate-torturing aftertaste is metallic, papery and tart and leaves me with cottonmouth. Light-medium bodied, mostly an impression created by the sugar, finishing thin and watery. Brown sugar, acidic earth and sauerkraut in the nose. Amber-brown in color with only a slight haziness. Small, light-tan head fades to a small ring, leaving no lacing. Pretty awful stuff, especially the atrocious aftertaste which is one of the worst I can remember."
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;(Gravity) No head. Very dark brown. Roasted scent with a hint of sugar. Some fizziness. Dry finish. In the mouth, it’s mainly smoke. Not unpleasant, but there’s little sign of the raspberries, just a slight sweetness after the smoke, revealing some cherry tartness.
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;Cambridge Fest. A mildly roasty and slightly milky stout. A pleasant drink, though there is no raspberry flavour, and - indeed - very little impact all round. Rather more full bodied and creamy than a mild. Slips down nicely, but leaves little impression.
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;Cask at the Maltings, York. Deep black with ruby highlights in the light - beautiful. One finger, small-bubble brown creamy head. Aroma is a bit slight - roasted malt, slight sweetness, a bit of tartness from fruits. Taste is nice, and surprisingly so. Roasted notes mix with milk chocolate and a light, very nice fruit note that lightens things up. Not in-your-face raspberry by any means - this could be any berry, or dark fruit, perhaps. Slight hop presence, with a moderately bitter, roasted malt aftertaste. Flavors overall are subdued but meld well together. Oh, and just the slightest, nearly imperceptible band-aid off-taste to it - glad I got a pint when I did. Palate is creamy, very little carbonation but enough to tingle the tongue ever so slightly. A treat.
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;Cask at Cambridge Winter Beer Festival. Ruby,black beer. Roast flavours dominate, no detectable raspberries, but pleasant enough.
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;"Cask (handpump), Market Porter, Southwark, London, January 2007. Lets get one thing straight at the outset. I didn’t really pick up too much in the way of raspberry. Perhaps my nose was having a bad day. Elements of tart indeterminate fruit in the palate - yes. Raspberry - no. And, however, you look at it, I think that has to be regarded as a shortcoming in a beer with ""Raspberry"" in its name. Conversely, whilst this was predominantly dark brown in colour, there was a very noticeable red (dare I say raspberry?) tinge. There’s a good solid malt backbone - firm, if not heavily roasted and some bitterness propping up the finish. Certainly not a powerful stout and, no doubt, not intended to be. But, without a great depth of fruit, it ends up seeming just a little meek and slight. None of this is to suggest its a bad beer. I just think an extra punnet or twenty of raspberries would liven things up enormously."
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. Deep ruby colour with thin beige head. Nice stout. Bit thin in mouth, but the raspberry fruit is nice, bit like raspberry ripple chocolate ice cream. Dark choc on aroma, choccy ice cream in mouth. Raspberry tingle on finish. Icy. Lacks a bit of fullness, but I like the choccy/raspberry flavours.
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;"Cask Close to black but with beautiful ruby highlights; small brownish-pink head. Stout-like, liquorice nose, a bit like coaled wood. Very little fruityness or sweetness in the nose. Here we have a good balance: classical roasted stout flavours are mildered without becoming really sweet (let alone fruity). Only retronasal the raspberry starts to give an impression - as if from artisanal Italian raspberry ice cream. Medium bodied, no burning, very good balance. I’m pleasantly surprised - and a lot of other tasters were too."
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. A black coloured beer with abeige coloured bubbly head and a little pink scum around the edge. The aroma is a little roasty and a tiny bit fruity. The fruit comes through better in the taste, but it is again no more than hinted at. The base stout beer though, is very smooth and drinkable with good dark malt flavours, a little chocolate and a nice long finish. An accomplished well-balanced beer.
Fenland Raspberry Stout;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Stout;Fenland Brewery;cask delivered by gravity at the Maltings 14th annual beer festival, York: black with ruby color at the bottom. Roasted nose with some tobacco and faint bit of raspberry. Flavored is roasted but dominated by tobacco notes. Very little raspberry in the backround. Medium Palate. Nothing Great
Trailhead Octoberfest;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Sampled at Augusta Festival. This poured with some amber hues and just a little foam. Clear. There are light spices in the flavor and aroma. Soft malts that included a bit of caramel and a hint of grain. This is light fare.
Trailhead Octoberfest;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Sample from beerfest in Augusta. Going off notes. Amber pour with a tiny white head that was gone within seconds. Aroma was malts, caramel, candies and sugar. Flavor was bready, malty and caramel. Thinner and kind of weak. Stronger malty aftertaste. Average to above average at best.

Trailhead Octoberfest;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Trailhead Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewery<!-- p --> Clear amber with a thin off white head. The nose is your typical octoberfest with malts and grains. No hop character really. The taste is soft with some more malts and what I see as earthy tones with just a hint of copper. Very drinkable and enjoyable.
Front Street Stars & Stripes;Fakenham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Front Street Brewery (UK);Cask (gravity dispense) at St Albans Beer Festival, September 2006. Golden amber colour. From the name I expected some US hop influence but I can’t say I found it too much in evidence. Seemed like a fairly straightforward bitter to me, with light spicy hops and a little dry malt. Tasted more like a regular best bitter than a stronger beer.
Front Street Stars & Stripes;Fakenham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Front Street Brewery (UK);cask delivered by gravity at the Maltings 14th annual beer festival, York: Amber color, with small white head.

Empire Valour;Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Empire Brewing Co.;Bottle. Golden and bright with a small white head. Aromas are biscuit malts with lots of sweet hops. Quite lager-like with some addictive saltiness. Flavours are biscuit malts with peppery, spicy hops. Has a good fruity bitterness. Dry on the finish. A decent crisp bottle conditioned ale.
Empire Valour;Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Empire Brewing Co.;Cask at the Maltings 14th Annual Beer Festival, York: Lovely aroms of citus, earthy and dusty hops. Loads of good grapefruit and citrus flavors. Nice balance with the pale malt, but this beer definitely show off the hops more. Bitter as you finish. Beautiful lacing. Medium Palate. Yummy brew
Fernandes Golden Otter;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Fernandes Brewery (Ossett);cask at the Maltings 14th annual beer festival, York: Golden color with white cask head. Aroma is a mix of floral hops and citrus. Malt is more pronounced then most golden ales and balances nicly with the flavors of the floral and citrus hops. fruity and crisp. bitters towards finish but still remains lots of malt flavor. The most balanced golden ale I’ve ever drank. Quite nice.
Tahquamenon Falls Harvest Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Draught at the Tahquamenon Brewery, Tahquamenon Falls, MI. Cloudy golden color with a tiny off-white head. Wheat, dryness and sweet malt in the aroma. Yeast, wort, wheat and sweet malt in the flavor. Not quite ready? ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Tahquamenon Falls Harvest Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Pours a bubbly hazy golden yellow with a thin head. Aroma is light wheat malts, and so is the flavor. Light body, plenty of carbonation. Not much going on.
Tahquamenon Falls Harvest Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewpub. The appearance had a decent bronzed amber color with a fairly decent transparency about it to leave some carbonation rising in the body. The head was there and it had about a finger’s worth and ended up barely any lacing about it. The smell had some light wheat to grainy breadiness overcoating a decent apple - like substance. The taste was mainly sweet and allowed a decent apple quality in the aftertaste. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body. The sessionability is somewhat there but also has a carbonation that seemed okay for the style and to me. Overall, I say this was a fairly good beer worthy of having again.
Tahquamenon Falls Harvest Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pale yellow colour. Difficult to get a real good impression from the tiny taster provided - no sampler trays at this brewpub (with only three beers available there wouldn’t be much point anyway) and I sure wasn’t going to have a whole pint. Clean enough but lacking in flavour and body. But that’s pretty much the style I suppose. Inoffensive but uninspiring stuff. Not sure I could have distinguished this from the Lumberjack Lager in a blind tasting.
Tahquamenon Falls Harvest Wheat Ale;Newberry, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Tahquamenon Falls Brewery;Pour of pale golden, clearish, with a frothy white head and little visible carbonation. Aroma of wickingly sweet off-malt, with stinky corn sugars. Flavor was similiar with some bizarre artifical flavor of some sort, with peach pits, candied bananas and tangy bubblegum. Not real pleasing, but not too gross. Whatever. Light and kind of drinkable. Blah. Carbonation was a distant percolation. Not really there either. Ugh.
Globe Light;Glossop, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Globe Brewery;cask at the Maltings 14th annual beer festival, York: very light yellow color. Aroma is floral hops. balanced. very watery. Some citruss and eathy tastes. Nothing to brag about. Pretty Boring
Pizza Port Sticky Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);This was 2012 version, so 4-years old, on tap at Craft Heads on the occasion of their 7th anniversary. Poured nice and dark, formidable beige head. Aroma had some cocoa, bitter chocolate and also a decent cupful of roast. Wow! I think this beer has only benefitted from the age, feels like its peaking at the moment. Flavours have blended nicely but by all means have not faded - crisp roast character with shiny biter chocolate and toffee sweetness. Impressed!
Pizza Port Sticky Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"""An overlooked (given the awesomeness of Night Rider(S) right after) tasty american IS.

Pizza Port Sticky Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);On tap at Carlsblad. A good stout, though not a RIS. Way above average roast, too much roast. Dark brown, lacey. Overcarbonated. Drinkable, tasty.
Pizza Port Sticky Stout;Carlsbad, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Growler thanks to JohnnyJ. Pours a clear deep brown with a brown head that lasts throughout the beer. Aroma is full of roasted malts with some coffee and dark grains with a hint of dark chocolate.

Elmars Marzen;Henley Brook, Perth, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Elmars In The Valley;Tap at the brewery. Pretty shit aroma smells like Carlton draught. Real rough rusty aroma. Taste is malty with not much else going for it. Average ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Elmars Marzen;Henley Brook, Perth, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Elmars In The Valley;A very authentic Oktoberfest style beer. Clean, malty (toasty) and easy drinking. Only the lightest caramel sweetness which is a common fault in these beers (IMO). This place brews some real gems from time to time. Had a litre of it yesterday which led to a nice sleep on the couch when I got home.
Elmars Marzen;Henley Brook, Perth, Australia;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Elmars In The Valley;First though this was an coppery amber body but up against the bock it was yellow/dull golden colour with a short lasting head. Not a lot of aroma. Caramel in the taste at first then a small dose of resiny hops, medium body and sticky finish, not my style, probably easy enough to drink plenty of for the Octoberfest.

Mash Brewing Belgian Tripel;Perth, Australia;Tripel;Mash Brewing;"Very cloudy straw coloured body, average lasting head. This beer reminded me of the ’’Belgian Ice"" at the Indian Ocean Bar although the orange characters don’t stand out as much in this. Some aroma of mushy banana. Zesty, medium body, cloves, yeast and the alcohol is hiding waiting to get you. One of the better beers that Mash have done or was it just that I had a couple prior to this."

Bell's Melstrand;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Bell's Brewery;Draft sampler at the Eccentric, 12/2/06. The premise here is that they’re making a series of pale ales named for U.P. towns. This one’s blond in color, with a light malty nose. A ring of foam in the taster. Good malts at the start, then nicely hopped. A bit of yeast shows that it’s unfiltered, but it still looks nice and clear.

Brothers Festival Pear Cider;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Brothers Cider;50 cl bottle. Not really interesting, taste is full of alcohol, some vague fermented pear that is somewhat sour.

Its aroma is better than taste, and overall as a strong Perry, it’s still a little too light in taste and feel. Still, an okay and easy one to wash down meals."
Brothers Festival Pear Cider;Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England;Perry;Brothers Cider;50cl bottle. Perry aroma - that is already good. Earthy, cellary, oaky - tastes and feels like hand pumped cider. A bit too heavy on the sugars, but this is inevitable, otherwise there be only yeast and acid at the same time. Finish is sweet with a dash of toffee. Abv is well hidden. One of the few perries available in Estonia, and I can live with that.

Aroma has pukey medicinal bitterness, toffee and rotting apples. Taste has raw pears with some apple jam and toffee. Not really woody; a bit funky but in the wrong way.

Sierra Nevada Bigfoot (Barrel Aged);Chico, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;July 9th, 2015 - This is a big boy, and like an adolescent labrador it doesn't know it's own heft, but it settles on your gut anyway. For such a dark sounding beer, it actually let's some light through the shaker pint glass it occupies, casting a dark brown haze onto the table. But the nose is true to form, with three primary notes at play: booze, wood and whiskey. The palate is noticeably oily, with alcohol and plenty of whiskey to burn, which deserves to be shared. The flavor is neither too sweet nor too intense, and repeated sips reveal subtler notes of leather. But make no mistake - this brew is hot with ethanol.

Tractor Brewing Half-Acre Hefeweizen;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Tractor Brewing Company;GABF 2006. The beer pours to a filtered looking gold body with a lasting white head. I figure it’s not a kristallweizen because my buddy Dave’s hefe looked very similar and wasn’t filtered. The cold seemed to drop out the murkiness. The beer has a nice wheaty aroma with cloves, clover, banana. Rich and very clean and crisp. Same with the flavor. Creamy crisp refreshing palate. I’d definitely drink this again.
Tractor Brewing Inebriator;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Tractor Brewing Company;amber pour tall dense tan head some thin lace. Odd sweet aroma of strawberries, carmels, sugars, and an odd fruit and spice. Pal was pretty avg. Flavor was a wheaty grainy carmel, pretty plain.
Sacramento Oktoberfest;Sacramento, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sacramento Brewing Company;For some reason this was on at PP Carlsbad in February. Orange to caramel in color with a off white head. Aroma of fruit, caramel, and toasted nuts. Flavor of fruity caramel in the base with an earthy finish. Some bread, apple, and a faint hint of sweetness. A bit unusual for the style, if there is such a thing, but nothing great.

Sacramento Oktoberfest;Sacramento, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Sacramento Brewing Company;On tap at the Sacramento location. 4 ounce sample. Somewhat spicy hop aroma with some more toasted maltiness present. Light floral hop notes are also detected, while the aroma as a whole is somewhat faint and lacking the sweetness I expect from the style. Moderately/mostly hazy unfiltered orangey-amber body with a nice, firm off-yellowish head. Attractive. Toasty, malty, slightly smoked start, which becomes very spicy and pretty hopped to finish. Hops are too present for this style and malts are not sweet enough. Not really to style. This is different, but good.
Grand Union One Hop: Magnum;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Gravity, Turf Tavern Autumn Ale Festival. Shiny pale gold, cap of off-white.

Lovelyin mouth, right balance of pale biscuity malt with some later juicyness. Then dry hop finish. Hop is slightly astringent on aroma, but reasonably subtle on end. Utterly drinkable. Hop shows a little sherbert on finish. Another nice beer in this series
Grand Union One Hop: Magnum;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;Cask@The Magpie&Crown, Brentford, London. Quite crisp and bitter, with a definite grassy hop note. Surprisingly clean and as i mentioned before, especially for a cask beer. Some light sweet honeyed characters aswell. Not bad.
Grand Union One Hop: Magnum;Hayes, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grand Union;"Cask conditioned, gravity dispense at St. Albans BF ’06. Gold & headless with perfumey hop aroma & a bitter & perfumey-hoppy flavour. Another enjoyable ""One Hop"" beer. A quick Google reveals Magnum to be a hop usually used for ""bittering"" rather than to provide aroma or flavour so its full characteristics are probably rarely on show as they are here. The ""One Hop"" series is now well into its mid-thirties- I’ve managed eight. How many more cultivated hop varieties are there?"

Crescent City Oktoberfest;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Crescent City Brewery;Thinnish tan head. Copper color. Very thin body without the heavy malty character I associate with Oktoberfests. Drinkable, but not a beer that I would have again.
Crescent City Oktoberfest;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Crescent City Brewery;I sampled this beer on tap at the brewpub in New Orleans. The beer had a earthy hop aroma with some roasty malt notes too. It was a light brown-amber color, was clear, and had a small, tan head with low retention and cling. The flavor was earthy hop and some grain, with a bit of malt, and a bit acidic, almost vinegar-ish. It had a thinner, light body with a smooth, light finish and low carbonation. I was not impressed with this beer at all.
Crescent City Oktoberfest;New Orleans, Louisiana, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Crescent City Brewery;on tap-pours a thin light tan head and hazy copper color.

Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Hard to imagine that I would ever rate a Mich this high, but I found this to be pretty good. Might be my favorite domestic semi-swillish porter so far. I am comparing this to Yuengling Porter, but a bit more of a robust flavor.....mainly of chocolate, coffee, some slight tart flavors of fruits/raspberry with a little bit of bitterness. I am tasting the coffee more the second time around. Got this in the variety pack, so I'd say is the best out of the 4 in there. I would buy again as an economy beer.
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);My second highest rated beer out of the sampler craft case. This one was a standard porter. As with the other beers out of that case there was hardly any aroma, except some very light coffee hints. Thin mouthfeel, flavors of roasted coffee, and nuts with some chocolate, with a coffee aftertaste. It was a little thin in all areas, a decent brew, but only a little above average. Originally rated on 11/28/08.
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Pours a dark brown. Aroma of chocolate/coffere. Flavors pretty much the same as the nose.
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"""a little thin for a porter...maybe more on par with an average american brown ale. not bad, but not something worth buying again, especially with all the more robust porters out there. """
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);The body has a thick, dark brown color with deep crimson highlights. On top sits a creamy light tan head that builds up tall before fading down to a thin covering that just hangs on till the last sip. The lacing is slick and slides down the glass just behind the head. The aroma is very sweet. There is a lot of sweet roasted malt with hint of caramel and chocolate. Also there is a very slight non-descript hop presence coming though as well. There is a big roasted malt sweetness with notes of honey, dark caramel and toffee. In it there are some light coffee and dark chocolate tones as well. Hop flavor is very modest but adds some bitterness and mild piney notes. The roasted flavor and light bitterness quickly fades off the tongue in the finish. The body is about medium with a very creamy and slick on the tongue. Its carbonation is soft but still in good balance
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle from 2007 as a joke at a bottle share. Pour is reddish brown with barley noticeable tan head. Aroma and flavor include faint chocolate, coffee, and hop bitterness. Actually not too terrible.
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);December 2009. From bottle. Pours very dark brown with a short tan head. Some roasted malt characteristics, chocolate, but too watery to really be good.
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Bottle. Possibly the worst porter on earth. They get points for giving it a go though. Far too sweet.
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);355 mL bottle. Not a bad intro to the style. No head, and a little thin, but the flavour is decent, if a little one-dimensional. A little sweet up front - could use a touch of roast.
Michelob Porter;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Porter;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);12 oz bottle pours dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma is malt and a bit of sweet chocolate. Taste is the same with a hint of coffee

Kona Coffee Macadamia Coconut Porter;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Porter;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);Can TWM Sterling - I had it a while ago, but found it an average porter with an artificial coconut thing happening.

Kona Coffee Macadamia Coconut Porter;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Porter;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);The coconut flavor is subtle but present, but like most of the kona’s I have had, this beer falls flat both in palate and overall enjoyability.

Kona Coffee Macadamia Coconut Porter;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Porter;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);On tap at Lunchbox Laboratory in Seattle, WA. Pours a medium brown with minimal white head with loose bubbles. Aroma is of mildly oily toasted coconut and a touch of fruit. Tastes like a thin and generic brown ale with a subtle coconut aftertaste. Not overly malty, not overly nutty, hops exist only for bitterness. There’s a strange vegetal aftertaste and slightly slick mouthfeel that leads to a disappointing finish.
Kona Coffee Macadamia Coconut Porter;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Porter;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);This is an excellent beer to try if you can get your hands on it. I had a sampler and a full glass on a local visit to the brewery-restaurant. I’m not a huge fan of coconut in general, but this beer was tasty. Partially because I was in the mood due to the location/vibe and wanting something unique (I’m otherwise a hop head). The coconut is front and center in the aftertaste and aroma. I will have another the next time I’m there.
Kona Coffee Macadamia Coconut Porter;Kailua Kona, Hawaii, United States;Porter;Kona Brewing Company (Craft Brew Alliance - AB InBev);I’m not a big fan of Porter beer but a buddy of mine gave me one and this is a very interesting beer. The coconut takes away the stiffness and makes it easy to drink. I wouldn’t recommend this beer for much but if you want a taste of the island, then this one might be for you. Cheers!

The aroma has noble hoppiness and grassiness with mild malts and grains off in the background.

Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;Pours a muddy orange with a small head. Aroma of hops and fruit - maybe a bit perfumed. Very mild flavour of fruit and a bit watery with a dry end.
Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;Bottle. Pours a nice hazy orange with a good foamy off white head. Aroma is caramel sweet with quite some American hoppyness. A touch spritzy. Extremely watery flavour (getting slightly better as it warms up). A touch of initial sweetness and a slightly dry end.
Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;An unclear amber beer with sediment floating around in the beer under a lazing light orange head. The aroma is sweet and very hoppy, the hops giving it notes of flowers - nice aroma. The flavor is sweet malty with a strong hop presence, giving it flowery notes, before a dry bitter end sets in. Closer to a bitter Bitter, than a Mild Ale.
Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;The color is beautiful amber-golden and the head is small, but creamy. The aroma is mild with notes of caramel and hops. The flavour is round, smooth with notes of caramel and a nice, light citrussy bitterness, that grows in the finish. 1866
Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;Bottled. Light amber coloured. Unclear. Fluffy beige head. Herbal and sweet aroma. Some spicy notes. Light citric and fruity flavour. Light caramel. Mild and quite thin. Is a bit unbalanced imo. Light bitter end. Dos’t remind me too much of a mild.
Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;Bottle. Golden/orange colour with a beige head. Aroma is sour , hop. Flavour is hop, sour, apple, malt.
Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;Bottled. A clear, golden beer with a beige head. Both aroma and flavor is a bit sour and hoppy, and there is pine as well in the aroma. The flavor has a weak malty background. Medium mouthfeel. A strange beer I think. (061122)
Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;Bottle. Small white and quickly disappearing head. Hazy orange body. Spicy hoppy aroma of oranges. Flavor clearly dominated by hops bitterness and a good deal of carbonation which contributes to making it a decent beer. The taste stays in the mouth for a long time.
Dagmar Ingeborg Mild Ale;Ringsted, Denmark;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dagmar Bryggeriet;(Bottle 50 cl) Pours a hazy, amber golden with a yellowish head. Light aroma of citrus. Medium body with some malt, but otherwise completely dominated by bitter, grapefruitish notes. Appears to be simply a lighter version of the brewery’s IPA. 231106

Blue Cat Saison de Quatre Ville;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Blue Cat Brew Pub;"This was served a Witbier-hazed pale yellow, mildly sparkling, holding a creamy, white head. Light sulfurs disperse above light funk and predominant yeasts in the nose. Crisp in the mouth yet finishing soft... which tones down the tart yeasts to seem delicate rather than sharp and cheesish as first perceived. Well done, and kudos to the brewers for thinking to age some. Probably not worth mentioning (but I will): I enjoyed several moments of levity shouting ""Saison de Quatre Ville!"", in a French accent, at my cats. Draught sample at AleFest 2007, Arlington Park Racetrack"
Blue Cat Saison de Quatre Ville;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Blue Cat Brew Pub;On tap @ AleFest. Hazy yellow in appearance with a small white head. Light malt aroma, almost nothing there. There are lots of lemon and orange flavors, spice, yeast and a light sweetness. Finishes dry. Drinkable, but not that great.
Blue Cat Saison de Quatre Ville;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Blue Cat Brew Pub;I learned at AleFest Chicago that this is Blue Cat’s Illinois Craft Brewers Guild ReplicAle from 2006. Good stuff. The aging did it well. It’s a somewhat hazy pale straw ale with a good frothy head that laces nicely. The aroma has lemon, grasses, sweet malt, lively spices, and a bit of barnyard funkiness to it. It’s lightly tart, has some clove and white peppers, a splash of sweet pale malts, and a refreshing grassy bitterness. The finish is dry and mildly bitter. A job well done.

Blue Cat Saison de Quatre Ville;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Blue Cat Brew Pub;on tap, pours hazy lemon with white head. nose has lemon and mild funk to it. flavor is very odd, sweet, dms, mild peppery, and loves. alcohol was well hidden, but this is not a good saison.
Blue Cat Saison de Quatre Ville;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draught at the brewub. Slightly hazy yellow-orange color with thin white head that left some lace. Attractive aroma of white wine, clove, and fall leaves. Tastes of white wine, clove, and a touch of alcohol. Tangy, dry, and vinous. Very good Saison.
Blue Cat Mocha Madness Coffee Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Blue Cat Brew Pub;on tap at the brewpub. this was all about the coffee. dark brown on the pour with a tan and laced well. seemed more like whipped coffee and cream than beer. nicely done
Blue Cat Mocha Madness Coffee Stout;Rock Island, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Blue Cat Brew Pub;Draft at the brewpub. Poured an opaque black color with foamy khaki head that laced the glass. Smelled of coffee, vanilla, and cream. Roasty and slightly sweet on the tongue with distinct coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Pretty good.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask-conditioned at the Seven Stars, Bristol 13/1/2018. Golden in colour, with a slight, white, head. A touch of leafy hops, stone fruits, weetabix malts and a moderately bitter finish. Ok.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask at Samul Pepys, Slipton. Pours golden with an off white head. Boring, golden session bitter. Nothing much going on. Meh. Certainly not a retired beer it’s quite common in Northamptonshire.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask, gravity, at St Neots Beer Festival ’10. Gold with a small white head. Offputting sulphurous aroma and grim sour taste. Mid bitter finish. Perhaps this wasn’t quite right on the day.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask, Leicester Fest ’08 (Thurs afternoon session). Beer Of The Festival so far. Heaped lacy gold. Nose of tangy citrus, with a rub of hopleaf and green apple. Citrussy hop spike softened with oaty mellowness. Big hop finish. Still and silky. Nice.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask, Leicester Fest 07. Golden with an off-white foam. Aromas are zesty citrus with apricot and pear. Has a good level of hopping with some soda water. Flavours are soft buttery malts with some lemon. Nice and hoppy with grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Decen pine hops on the aftertaste.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask@Leicester Beer Festival 2007. Golden beer with a light head. The aroma is fruity and zesty and the flavour is lightly hopped and nicely dry. Overall a nice lightly hopped golden beer.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask conditioned at Merton Beer Festival 16-02-07. This beer poured a golden colour with just the merest hint of a haze and a white quickly dissapearing head. The aroma was really sulphery and as Glenn mentioned we felt that it compared with Pedigree some years ago. The beer had a nice hoppiness with it and a very pleasant citrusy tang and at 3.8% I felt that it had pretty good depth with a lingering finish. Overall a decent beer that was still just a tad rough around the edges.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask conditioned at Merton Beer Fest 07. Orange gold beer with thin head. Big sulphery, eggy note to the aroma, plenty of Burtonisation going on, the aroma of the old Marstons pedigree we agreed. The beer itself is a light bitter with a lemony citricity and a dry finish. I couldn’t describe this as a session beer as there is too much going on, but pleasant enough.
Digfield Fool's Nook;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Digfield Ales;Cask conditioned - handpump - OGs Wellingborough. A light golden coloured beer. The aroma is sharp lemony hoppiness. The taste also is nice sharp hops a la JHB style beer. Good flavour for its ABV and a vast improvement on the first Digfield beer I had.Score 3.6 Subsequent ratings scored 3.3 and 3.4. Average becomes 3.4
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;12oz bottle 1/13/10 (RSRIZZO’s Winter Gathering courtesy of BeerandBlues2)-Pours a hazy orangish amber with no head. Aroma of sweetness, hops, and grapefruit. Taste of the same with alcohol. This light to medium bodied brew is past its prime.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Thanks to a friend for sharing this bottle. The beer pours a hazy brown color with no real head. The aroma is very sweet, with some pine and orange notes coming through from the hops. There is also a strong molasses character in the aroma, which I can’t really explain. The flavor is also interesting. There is a lot of alcohol and sweetness, similar to an aged barleywine. I also get some molasses, leather and tobacco character. There is a strong toffee malt backbone, as well as some faint pine and orange notes from the long-faded hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. As expected, this 6-year-old Double IPA has become more of a barleywine, but I am still excited I got to try it. Now, if I could just track down a Divine Reserve No. 1 I would have tried all 12 in the series.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Bottle thanks to mar) Pour is amber with no head..Nose is caramel malts, leather, spice, alcohol..Taste is spice, toffee, malts, leather, caramel..This sitting so long turned it into a barley wine pretty much.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;9 year old bottle. props to sloth, fly, Kaggie97, via coldbrewky. same burnt orange hue with slight ruby tones. no head jsut foam on the edges. sweet caramel nose with dark fruit. bigger body than the #11. caramel still melts around the mouth. Hop flavor has fadded, but bitterness remains at the same level.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Thanks to the slob/sloth and Fly/Kaggie for getting me this brew. Consumed directly after the 11. Yes for nine years old it is a bit faded but still quite consumable. Light malty nose...some plum. Up front it is a bit bigger than the 11. It is a hop mirage at this point...bitterness is still there but not overtly detectable as hop bitterness. A light tinny finish punctuates the even and long mouthfeel that is reminiscent of an English Barley wine. Groovy.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Clearly well passed its prime. This beer still had some really nice rich malts and deep hoppy shadow of something that was likely better once.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Süßlicher Hopfengeruch, eher mild. Sehr aromatisch-hopfiger Antrunk, den ich nur in abgeschwächter Form erwartet hätte. Der Alkohol ist hier bereits erkennbar. Sehr aromatisch und wichtig auch ausgeglichen, stark, sehr malzig werdend. Cremig, der Abgang ist etwas weniger würzig aber weiterhin noch stark aromatisch. Weiter angenehm, insgesamt milder werdend, bis noch eine süßliche Note bleibt. Etwas gealtertes Auftreten. Vielen Dank an den Doppelbock! 10/12/10/13/12/12
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;Poured this 2 years after it was bottled 9/11/2008, wish I would have remembered it was a double ipa before now. Pours a cloudy murky deep amber without much of a head. The aroma has got some citrusy grapefruity hops left in it and some strong caramel malt in there as well. Taste is about the same as the smell. The hops are there, but not in your face like most big ipa’s. Taste is grapefruit, caramel, pine and resin. I’ll bet this was a monster fresh. Creamy tart mouthfeel, thick body, ample carbonation. I would have loved to try this fresher but it somehow got lost in my cellar. Good brew that I’ll bet was great a couple of years ago.
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;From the saint Arnold divine reserve vertical tasting @ the common table on Dallas. This beer pours a golden amber with little to no head. The aromas are citrus, closet aromas and dough. The mouthfeel is sticky, bitter and not as hoppy considering its age. It has q little more acidity and less hop in the mouth. I liked it. Cheers!
Saint Arnold Divine Reserve #3;Houston, Texas, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Saint Arnold Brewing Company;A: The pour is a burnt orange/copper color with a nice white head. S: Sort of what you would expect from an old DIPA...oranges, sugar, and sweet malts. There’s also some vanilla, which is sort of surprisingly. T: Still a really nice bitterness to this beer, which is surprising after such a long time. A semi-sweet malt character, oranges, orange peels, and again the hint of vanilla. M: Medium body with a fairly lively level of carbonation. D: One of the better beers of the series, actually. This is sort of along the lines of how Stone 10th is now.

Cotswold 3.8 Pils;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cotswold Brewing Co.;500ml Bottle and Cask via The Harte and Magpie in Amersham. This quite simply my favourite lager and my favourite session beer. It is exquisite. Like its sister the Cotsworld Premium, this is an unpasterised lager that is so full of flavour. Its very hoppy on the nose and that transfers well to the taste and the palate. It is low in abv but it does not lose any of the taste of its stronger sister. Conversely it isnt over hopped which is a common problem with lower alcohol beers. If it wasn’t for the fact this is almost impossible to get where I live, Id be drinking it just about every session!
Cotswold 3.8 Pils;Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, England;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Cotswold Brewing Co.;Bottled. A golden beer with a lazing beige head. The aroma has notes of butter and malt. The flavor is sweet with notes of butter and malt. Thanks yespr for sharing.

Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;"From Mar 2007 Pours from 12 oz foil wrapped bottle a very dark brown with reddish hues and a small head of foam that disappeared almost immediately. The smell is wow. Huge notes of cocoa, dark fruit, vanilla, molasses, brandy, caramel, fig... The taste on first sip is loaded with dark fruit like plum, raisin, fig, black cherry and then... there's the vanilla floating around in the background along with some toffee and maple syrup. Wow. This brew really demands your attention but at the same time says, take your time lest evil befall you... And that's no problem for me because as complex and as tasty as it is, there's *no* denying the prowess it has in the abv department. Damn, I wish it was about 20 below out...just kidding. ;^) I *will* say that I'm not getting an alcohol ""burn"" but hey, I'm taking very VERY small sips. Well, I'm going to finish the review before I finish the brew and that's quite unusual for me but, I have to say, of the really huge brews in the +15%abv range that I've tried, this one is the most ""drinkable"". Well done Bristol Brewing!!"
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;Lucked into this in Colorado Springs several years ago. this was brewed in 03 and bottled in 2006. So it aged for 10 years - I had for probably 1/2 of that. I notice not many recent reviews. this was a treat due to my luck and age. this was part of a dark beer day/weekend and this was toward the end. the 18% put me on my ass - snuck up on me. my notes are fuzzy for that reason - definitely complex - 10+ things happening here. I really enjoyed it - very little alcohol in taste. glad to have had this experience
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;Bottle shared by alexsdad06 pour cola brown with minimal tan head. Nose maple syrup and molasses, light earthy, caramel, toffee. Taste is all over the place molasses and honey first, dark cherry, progressing to light roast, then ashy and smoke. Crazy progression.
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;Bottle back in like 2007ish?? Thanks again to Skyhand! Found some old notes the other day from some tastings we did, so the next few entries will all be tagged with Skyhand and not too long as I don’t remember much. This was a doozy though. Seemed quite mellow for 18%, with all those maple and honey flavors mixing perfectly with the roasty and licorice notes from the Impy Stout. Damn good stuff!
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;Bottle at BeerDig 2011 on 03/06/2011. Dark brown/mohogany body with a thin off white head. Big roast chocolate and soy aroma. Coffee and ash flavor with roast chocolate and creosote. Medium full body with moderately low carbonation.
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;Bottle: Brewed in ’03 & bottled in ’06. Thanks, Jeff! Deep brown body with literally no head - only a few small carbonation bubbles. Looks like Utopias but thinner. Aroma has lots of brown sugar, molasses, wet oak, very faint maple syrup notes, lots of vanilla candy in the finish, & slight signs of oxidation. Taste is pretty sweet with molasses, brown sugar, & big-time toffee up front. Again, light oxidation in the form of boozy sherry, only a very mild hint of staleness. Cocoa powder, vanilla, either maple or butterscotch... Hard to pinpoint exactly. Lots of dark fruit in the finish. Guys we were with suggested it finishes like a Port, & it absolutely does... Slightly boozy with a big, dark currant & fruity sweetness. Good stuff... BIG stuff, but doesn’t seem like 18%+.
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;Bottle, courtesy of Ratman197 (Thanks!). Brewed 25/9/2003, Bottled 9/5/2006. It pours like coke with a fizzy and frothy beige head, that quickly disappears. Aroma is vinous, sherry, sweet dried fruits, bourbon, chocolate, alcohol. Taste is light cardboard, bitter chocolate, dried fruits, sweet alcohol with a warming finish.
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;Brewed 25/9/2003, Bottled 9/5/2006 Pours not as dark as expected. Foams like coke, very quick and then dissapears. Smells sweet with influence of dried fruits. Tastes good, ends with raisins and other dried fruits.
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;Bottle: Thanks Madmitch: Served in a Chouffe glass: Brewed 2003/Bottled 2006: Brown pour. Very small lively and fairly quick changing/disappearing beige foamy head on top of a black colored beer. Aromas of vinous notes with liquorice, raisin, pepper, chalk, toffee, mocha, dried prunes, figs, hints of soya, brown sugars and sticky barley roast. Flavours of spices, roast, wood, chalk, ginger bread, port, toffee, raisin, dried prunes, coal, liquor, pepper, liquorice wood, some yeast, sweet barley malt roast, some bitters, some malts, some chocolate, some berries, light sticky sweet tar tones and hints of honey roast... Complex! Aftertaste is quite lingering mix of spices/pepper, raisin, toffee, wood, light sticky, some coal and chalk. Very interesting peppery tone! Low carbo, soft creamy yet spicy mouthfeel, full body and a creamy texture. Alcohol is well hidden! Nice beer for sure! Spicy but not alcoholic, tasty but nothing unbalanced. Interesting, strong, complex and some new flavours to discover.
Bristol XXX Warlock;Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bristol Brewing Company;"2003 brew date with a 2006 bottling date; this has gone past it's prime. Aroma has quite a bit of alcohol still, but behind that alcohol is notes of soy sauce, cardboard and sherry. There is also a teriyaki beef jerky note to the aroma. There is a hint of a fruity, dark berry note. Lots of alcohol. Pours a very still dark brown, not quite black with no head. Huge legs to this one. Flavor has quite a bit of alcohol, but also huge smoked, barbecue meat notes. Low to moderate bitterness. Some chocolate and coffee notes, but secondary to the alcohol and meat. Obviously no hop flavor. A bit of soy sauce, but the oxidation isn't as bad as in the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium full bodied; it's not as thick as one would expect a beer this large to be. Absolutely no carbonation. Lots of alcohol warmth. Overall this beer is well past it's prime, but has held up better than many other beers would have. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"
Rocky River Ancho Mama;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Had on draft at GABF. A special offering by Rocky River Brewing Company based on their award winning Smokestack Porter. The same, but with chipotle and 4 other chilies added for addtional flavor. I’ve tried a few chipotle-smoked porters before, but this had the best balance of chile, smoke, and porter to date. Wonderful smoky nose with a kick. Medium bodied, roasty/smoky/chile/nutty/coffee flavors open up on the tongue. Just enough chile kick to let you know it’s there without being overwhelming. Really an excellent beer, I hope I come across this again.

Clear golden with some small bubbles in the glass, medium size frothy head that leaves good lacing. Weak grassy aroma. Mouthfeel is watery and aggessivt carbonated which makes it pretty hard. Thin taste bread and grass, neither bitter nor sweet, just too watery.
Carlsberg (Sverige) 2.8%;Falkenberg, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Carlsberg Sverige;*Can from Hemköp in Stockholm. Sweetish strange beginning. The malty body is too sweetish, the water is refreshing but the beer is unround. No bitterness there, refreshing but lots of grain in the body. Strange.

Löwenbräu 3.5%;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);I remember drinking this on tap in Ind Coope pubs in the late 70s early 80s. Used to be one of my favourites. This canned beer seems to had list its alcoholic content dropping from 5.2 to 3.5. It appears to have become a budget beer...not what it used to be. If you can get hold of any of the original in bottles go for it. This canned version is nothing to write home about. Cheap and plain
Löwenbräu 3.5%;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Löwenbräu Munich (AB InBev);I used to enjoy Lowenbrau and saw it on sale in Lidl. I should have checked, it was too cheap and only 3.5%. It is now a budget lager and to be avoided!
The Cambridge House Oktoberale;Granby, Connecticut, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;The Cambridge House;Draught @ Cambridge House: This one pours a mostly orangish dark amber color. There was a very small off white head on mine. The nose is quite nice. There is some nuttiness, fall spices and malts in there. The taste is equally good. The body is good, and there is a very good blend of the spices, malts and hops to make a very drinkable beer. There is a slight sweetness and roastiness in there also. Another winner for Steve and Dave. Hopefully ther will take this one to the GABF next year!
San Juan Starboard Porter;Friday Harbor, Washington, United States;Porter;San Juan Brewing Company;Pacific Northwest Vacation 2007 8/26/2007: San Juan Starboard Porter is dark mahogany brown with a lasting thin beige crown. Only a faint trace of chocolate can be found in the aroma. The aroma and flavor are also VERY yeasty to the point that all other flavors are suffocated. The finish is dry with a slightly roasted flavor. This beer has a medium body and moderate carbonation but somehow is not very smooth! Overall this porter was a disappointment. 4 oz draught sample (4.2% Alc By Wt, #1039, OG 1.051, Brewed 7/19/2007) at the Front Street Ale House in Friday Harbor, Washington. Rating #2 for this beer...

Loddon Mumbojumbo;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Loddon Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Hazed gold with no head. Sweet, honeyed and perfumey to me, quite flowery and apple like, possibly too young. Not very keen on this one.

Ramsgate Gadds Escape;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Stout - Imperial;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Bottle. Now, this was an unfortunate experience. I was quite looking forward to trying this. Black, with ever so slightly brown edges. Quite dry, yet felt quite sugary and also metallic. Something about it reminded me of lead pencils and asphalt. Some slight old socks and light soggy woody flavours. Probably the most dissapointed i have been with a beer in a long time.
Ramsgate Gadds Escape;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Stout - Imperial;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);A Mes rate: 50cl bottle at Chris O’s extravaganza. This followed the Dark Lord so it had to be really impressive to not seem dull and lifeless. Thankfully this did the job very well. Black with a cream head. Malty stouty nose with an edge of alcohol. Lovely liquorice flavour with perhaps just a little too much alcohol. Wonderfully thick and creamy soft palate. Very enjoyable stuff.
Ramsgate Gadds Escape;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Stout - Imperial;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);ChrisFestSoft and dreamy, then seems to fold in on itself and go on for ever. Awesome beer. Very yummy mummy indeed.
Ramsgate Gadds Escape;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Stout - Imperial;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Bottled at Chris_O Fest March 2007. A black coloured beer with a decent whitish head. The aroma is slightly fruity with some oily notes. The taste is stouty and oily. Some fishy notes. Highly carbonated. Ok but misses a few tricks.
Ramsgate Gadds Escape;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Stout - Imperial;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);33cl bottle care of Phil_L. Thanks Phil. Black with brown edges. Lasting tan head. I had this with dessert on Boxing Day (chocolate torte with raspberries) and it went pretty well with it. Good carbonation on opening. Pours well with lasting head. Slight charcoal on aroma along with the expected roasted malts. Dark choc and blackberry/black cherry aromas. A little over carbonated in mouth. Stunning chocolate flavours in the mouth. Great balance, not too oily or powdery. Quite juicy, but with good depth. Very choccy throughout. Really rather nice. Can’t say the alcohol threw it out of balance either. Good English Impy stout.
Ramsgate Gadds Escape;Broadstairs, Kent, England;Stout - Imperial;Ramsgate Brewery (Gadds);Impressive Dark Ale, to celebrate the brewery’s departure from the Brewhouse in the Harbour. Light roast on the nose, not in yer face, warm and dry the same on the sip. immediate alcohol. Dry on the finish. BREW THIS AGAIN!

Szot Amber Ale;Santiago, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Szot Microbrewery;Dark amber body white head nice lacing. Sweet biscuit and dried fruit aroma. Sweeter snd more flavor than most amber ales. Quite nice.
Szot Amber Ale;Santiago, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Szot Microbrewery;330ml bottle. Super hoppy smell, IPA like. Deep amber color with white head. Sweet sticky taste, completely fills your mouth and kind of stick to the walls of the head. Meh, it’s good.
Szot Amber Ale;Santiago, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Szot Microbrewery;Dark ruby with very low head retention, it has a very strong caramel and berry aroma and flavor, bitterness is more in the low end. It has a dry aftertaste. Just not amber for me, I don’t like the fruity berry flavor, seems like artificial.
Szot Amber Ale;Santiago, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle from Kyoto Isetan. It pours an opaque amber brown with a sugary caramel aroma that is like a candied toffee. The taste is malty sweet caramel with a bit of a bitter bite. Not bad it has a nice nuttiness to it.
Szot Amber Ale;Santiago, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Szot Microbrewery;Aroma: Grassy hops, vinuous, herb, earthy Appearance: Slightly hazy amber body. Medium off-white head.

Szot Amber Ale;Santiago, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Szot Microbrewery;330ml bottle. A very hazy amber on the pour with a fizzy, rapidly fading white head. Like an unintentional though gentle sour. Orange, pith, lemon, some funk and toast. Confused. Quite tart on both nose and palate. Light to medium body, medium carbonation and a lingering mid-fruit dry tartness. If I thought it was supposed to be like this I might have scored it higher so sue me.
Szot Amber Ale;Santiago, Chile;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Szot Microbrewery;(330ml bottle) Pours a cloudy golden amber body with a medium off-white head. Aroma of pineapple, red apple, grapes, kiwi, and grass. Flavor of grain, orange, caramel, and grass with a moderately dry finish.
Szot Negra Stout;Santiago, Chile;Stout;Szot Microbrewery;Botella, en Jumbo Los Ángeles. Color negro oscuro con cabeza de espuma muy leve. Aroma a chocolate y café. En boca se presenta sedosa, con un amargor moderado, equilibrado con el dulzor de las maltas. Se perciben notas a chocolate, frutos secos y café. El sabor a tostado de las maltas especiales es muy potente. El calor en boca recuerda un buen brandy. Baja carbonatación, acorde con el estilo. Una buena Stout, pero me esperaba un poquito más.
Szot Negra Stout;Santiago, Chile;Stout;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle courtesy of Mick. Szot Negra stout 5.8% a dark black pour with a big foamy light beige head. The nose is rich umami, sweet chocolate & berries. Medium bodied, very smooth with w round carbonation. The taste is a reach sweet malty fruit dark malts. Light roastiness, sweet tangy fruits & dark chocolate - damn good stuff.
Szot Negra Stout;Santiago, Chile;Stout;Szot Microbrewery;330ml bottle. A deep, opaque brown in colour with a fine though lasting fizzy light tan head on the pour. Surprise, surprise and so my disappointing run with this brewery continues. In a vein similar to my experience with the Szot Amber and Strong this is dominated by a tart acetic character. There’s nothing other than tart fruit on the nose and the roasty component you’d expect and hope for in a stout is barely discernible beneath the apply dryness on the palate. So frustrating particularly given the majority of positive reviews this one’s garnered. Light to medium body, medium carbonation and a touch of coffee on the back end but it’s otherwise controlled by a sour fruit tang.
Szot Negra Stout;Santiago, Chile;Stout;Szot Microbrewery;33cl bottle from Arve_Christian - thanks a lot! Pours clear dark brown with a reddish hue and a small but lasting beige head. Aroma of roasted malt, dark fruits and licorice with hints of coffee and wood. Medium sweet and roasty with some fruity and wooden notes and a quite balanced bitterness. Medium body with fairly average carbonation. Well balanced and easy to drink. Nice stout, fits perfectly on a hot summer day like today.

Szot Negra Stout;Santiago, Chile;Stout;Szot Microbrewery;Darkish brown. Very thick head - too much, really. The aroma has some tartness, which is unfortunate. Mostly chocolate, but again with a little tartness.

Szot Negra Stout;Santiago, Chile;Stout;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle, 5%. Fruity aroma, a bit of roasted tar. Almost black colour, clear red shine. Small tan head. The flavour is nicely roasted, good coffee note, slightly acidic to balance. Good for ABV.

Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;18/12/2018. Bottle from Jumbo Costanera Centre, Santiago. Pours pale amber with a huge foamy off-white head from a bottle that kept giving. Aroma of sweet malt, toffee, grain, light fruit and a little milky chocolate. Medium plus sweetness, light bitterness. Medium body, oily texture, average carbonation.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;I really enjoyed this beer, thick and tasty but still refreshing. A nice unfiltered beer for agreat price that keep its bubbles. Would drink again, would buy again.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;Appearance and taste are the best qualities of this beer. It’s pretty light and thick, sweet and refreshing.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle. Thanks Will. Interesting, grassy hops, little bit of maltiness. Nice enough but unsurprisingly underwhelming.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle shared, thanks Will. Big piney hop bite and bitter caramel, not too sure what style that is though but it may be an interesting pairing with spicy chili. Pretty average and unbalanced overall.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;Super old bottle bought from the final days of Masuyo (now closed). Drank one week before best buy date. Heineken-like skunky nose with some light grain and pepper. Taste is well-balanced and rather light-bodied, but refreshing. Good bitterness on the finish with some white pepper. Not bad for being almost a year and a half old.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle, 33cl. Murky wheat golden colour with a minimal offwhite head. Sweet, spicy aroma with hints of caramel, citrus zest, green grapes. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Sweet and quite bitter. Very refreshing and drinkable, with great herbal and malt character.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle from Isetan Kyoto. Amber-orange color, quite cloudy, with a tall, fine head and evident carbonation. Very rich, malty nose, caramel, a bit of fudge. Almost more like a dunkel in the nose. Sweet malt, minerals, caramel, peaches, something a bit astringent, light hop flavor, then decent bitterness. Rather dirty in the malt area, yeasty, seems like they used extract. Not convincing. Heavy and cloying.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;Rubia al Vapor, quite a nice looking pour - a deep cloudy honey amber with a thick beige creamy head with no lacing but a creamy film floating atop the beer. Malty and fruity aroma, not bad. Medium bodied with a spritzy carbonation. The taste is surprisingly bitter, malts, nuts, some fruitiness maybe occasional subtle hints of fusel. Not too surprising as this beer seems to have been made in February - the height of the Chilean summer. Overall not too shabby. My general impression is a bit more boozy than the 5.8%, nice malts, bitter caramel, a bit of fruits, reminds me of some Mikkeller beers I had ages ago... decent but california common doesn’t spring to mind. Actually as it warmed up it grew on me and became more appetizing.
Szot Rubia Al Vapor;Santiago, Chile;California Common / Steam Beer;Szot Microbrewery;Aroma: Resin, bready, spice, alcohol, toasty, Appearance: Hazy amber body. Medium white head.

Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;Gran cerveza muy buena relacion precio calidad. Resulta un poco dificil encontrarla. Pero vale la pena probarla cuando esta disponible.
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;A truly great beer. Flavourful with the right carbonation and a very ’alive!’ feeling to it. Alcohol is well integrated to the natural beer flavours. I normally pour the yeast remains in with the beer, but I’m glad I didn’t do it with this one, as there was just too much of it! I’m sure it made it great, though!
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;Pours copper/gold with a thin ring of bubbles. Smells of sweet fruit, some tarte hints, earthy, tea, some boozy elements, toffee, molasses, peppery. Tastes of tarte fruit, some oaky hints, vanilla, dry, some spicy hints, some hints of sweet citrus, earthy finish. Full bodied. 2007 bottle. One of the best South American beers I’ve had to date.
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;"500mL Bottle at Bar Irlandés. Bottle said it was made in Dec06 and bottled in Feb 07. Aroma-right away you can tell it’s a been aged a few years-dank, cigary, flat flavored old beerness-I would say it’s about 6 months past it’s prime, but still drinking very well nonetheless. Hops have all faded from the nose, but they are still very much in the flavor and palate. This beer has an aggressive bitterness in the finish-like a chinook/colombus combo if I had to guess-piny and rough with some earthy herbalness. The finish was definitely the stand out moment in this beer, particularly the hops. Dried out nicely, not much for residual sweetness, but tons of deep caramel flavors. No alcohol heat, smooth as can be. Flavor has quite a bit of cherry that is borderline cough syrupy (a mixed bag), some wood, old ale ""flavors"", chocolate, caramel (but doesn’t come through as much till the finish). Carbonation was right where it should be. A very solid 4.1."
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;Very complex aroma an flavor. Some nuts, toffee and liqcuor touches. Same in palate, plus some citrus touches, even though I expected a little more sweetness. Carbonation was very low, but probably that was a defect on this particular bottle.
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;Powerfull and long lasting taste.. Szots best beer. Shows some notes of malt, oak and still fresh tropical, peaches, pears.
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;iBottle at Sicosis/i A Barley wine / Strong ale sold in a 500ml bottle seemed a bit strange but none the less it was one of the better beers I tried whilst in Chile. Prominent though not overpowering caramel aroma, really smooth taste, hidden alcohol and also a touch of honey on the aroma.
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;Appearance: dark amber color. Medium head, ivory color, dense and persistent. Good adherence at glass. Aroma: sweet malty, toffee, candy, butterscotch, vanilla, oak and cream. Evidently complex. Fruitiness of peaches, ripe pears and plums. Floral hoppy, some aniseed. Nutty, cherries and cinnamon touches. Flavor: syrupy malty, toffee, butterscotch, cream and vanilla notes in start. Sweet-fruity of syrup plums, red raisin, apricot and cherry. Too nutty, almonds, cinnamon and humid wood touches. Persistent hoppy finish, with aniseed and mentholated notes. Hidden liquory, reminiscences of camomile and amaretto liquors. Complex and self-personality. Palate: medium body, syrup texture. Little and medium carbonation. A Chilean nicety, complex, power and balanced.
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle. Color amber, very dark. The cloudy and cremy head. The Aroma is to strawberries and caramel. In paladar is very malty, with toasted seeds and wood. Some alcohol signs appear, in a penetrating sweet flavor. Very good finish, unexpected. A beer to recommend single to that they know to drink, because the alcohol well is camouflaged (Hidden).
Szot Strong Ale 12%;Santiago, Chile;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Szot Microbrewery;Bottle, april 07. Thanks to Lilith, Nigredo and Panzerfaust!. Shinny, clear, deep copper/ burgundy color with light red hues and a creamy, dense, light beige head. Aroma is fruity, some dates, fruit cake and some brandy. Flavor is nutty, sherry brandy rich maltiness, complex, layered with some dried fruits. Excellent. Full MF, packs a flavor punch, deep, complex, satisfying and not heavy. Highly refined, nutty BW, which may be the finest south american brew.

The mild aroma was malty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt hops astringent and was slightly grassy. Not one that I would buy again.

Black Forest Brau Keller Sullys Irish Stout;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Black Forest Brau Keller;This stout poured the usual black colour with a nice creamy brown head. To the nose was a light coffee scent with chocolate and some earthy notes. First sip was smooth with flavours of chocolate and burnt ash. A little coffee flavour added.

Interesting aroma of chocolate and roasted malt. Mild flavor of chocolate and roasted malt with a bitter finish. The body is light with a dry texture and lively carbonation.

Poured pitch black with creamy light brown Guinness type head. Excellent aroma of sweet caramel, roasted malts, molasses, and chocolate malts. Rich and inviting. The mouth feel is a tad thin but not too bad for the style. There are lots of sweet caramel malts, roasted to burnt malts and chocolate malts. Very tasty brew that left nice lacing behind.
Black Forest Brau Keller Sullys Irish Stout;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;Black Forest Brau Keller;Draft from the brewery. A burnt black beer. A bit grainy taste that makes it quite different. A very good beer, if not very stouty.

Market Street Octoberfest;Corning, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Market Street Brewing Company;Deep amber, light tan creamy head. Nose held soft notes of toasted florals, earth, caramel, and milk chocolate. Flavor was well toasted with more touches of caramel, chocolate, and just a hint of citrus. Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, dry bittersweet finish. Not bad by any means...
Market Street Octoberfest;Corning, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Market Street Brewing Company;Growler brought back by my brother-in-law. Nice ruddy copper body. Nose is peanutty malt, a little caramel, slight alcohol burn, perhaps a bit of light fruitiness. Flavor is caramel, more bitterness than I expected, a bit of fruit and a peanut-brittle finish. A bit odd.
Capitol City Double Barrel IPA;Arlington, Virginia, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Capitol City Brewing Company;Baltimore Location - 17.9 OG - Deep hazy amber, thick creamy white head. Intense hop bitter nose of evergreen, pine, and grapefruit rind, with a softer underlying wave of peach, apricot, and sweet gooey caramel.

Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;had two of these with dinner tonight. Pours copper, minimal head, translucent. Slight bitterness on top of crackers and malt. Slight floral finish. medium body.
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;Pour from a brown growler that I bought at the brew pub while passing through Ludington. Cloudy amber orange brew with decent head, ample delicate lacing in the glass. Moderate aroma blending citrus (orange), floral hops, a little each of wood, resin and spice. taste is moderately sweet caramel at the start, modest hops at mid swallow - woody, bitter, resinous, a little earth and fruit - a modest citrus flourish at the finish building on the mid swallow hop profile. Has the restraint and malt of an English IPA and half of the hops profile seems English (reminds me of fuggles hopped ales) but some of the citrus punch of an American IPA. Kind of straddles the styles but to my taste does so very successfully. I could easily kick back much more than this one growler!
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;Hazy gold draft as part of a flight in Ludington. Sweet citrus aroma like mandarin oranges. Green hops with some resin in the flavor. Nice.
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Caramel color with minimal head. Malt and hop aromas and flavors. Citrus too.
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;5 oz. sample on 5-20-12 (Flight 2)-served a murky light copper color, great nose of pine, citrus, and lake perch (yeah, even I didn’t get that one). Hits the mouth with a medium body, very fine malt laced with caramel up front, small hop wave in the middle, finish is mildly acidic. zzzz...
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear orange with a small white head. Aroma of light fruits, jam, and malt. Flavor of toasted wheaty malt, floral hops, and bitter hops in the finish. More of a pale ale than an IPA but a pretty decent drinker. 6/4/7/3/13 [3.3/5]
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;Growler straight from the brewery about a week old, courtesy of my girlfriend :) . Pours a decent light golden color with a beautiful thick creamy off white head. Aroma is a delicious blend of fresh piney hops with a nice sweet caramel malt backbone. Very fresh and delicious. Slightly citric with some sweet fruitiness. Flavor starts with a nice hop burst that isn’t too overly pressing, allowing the pale and caramel maltiness to come through. Kind of fades towards the finish and becomes a bit bland before a final medium bitterness that lingers for a bit. Medium creamy body and a weak carbonation from sitting in the growler. Not a bad IPA, not as bad as some other people seem to think. I think its easy drinking and not overly bitter
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;Tap: Clean golden hue, small ring of foam and good lace. The aroma has muted piney hops, apple and apricot esters, bready malt and a hint of diacetyl. The taste has an initial sharp hop bitterness and acidity but fades quickly, some pale malts but not much depth. The mouth feel is watery, soft and with a touch of mineral. A underwhelming beer that lacks any character.
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;Part of a sampler at the restaurant. I note that I had a cold when I visited and could not get a great sample of the aroma of the beers that I sampled. Very strong aroma (noted even with my cold). Strong citrus aroma and flavor (almost too strong).
Jamesport IPA;Ludington, Michigan, United States;IPA;Jamesport Brewing Company;Had this one on draught as part of the sampler at the brewpub in Ludington, Michigan. Clear, medium orange pour with lots of rosiness in the nose, very tannic and bitter with black tea, strong finish. A decent IPA.
Sherwood Abbey Normal Ale;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Dubbel;Sherwood Brewing Company;Picked up a growler of this. poured a cloudy honey with a small off white head. aroma when I was pouring this got a big hit of malt but once in the glass it mellowed a bit, sour fruits, yeast, brown sugar, and alcohol as it warmed. flavor, spicey hints of cinnamon, malt and than the yeast. nice dry mouth feel on this one
Outer Banks Sorghum Molasses Brown;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;On draft at the brewpub 11-10-06. Mahogany brown with a medium beige head. Sweet aroma of brown sugar and caramel. Medium body, lightly carbonated. Some hop flavors complement the brown sugary sweetness, but it still finishes a little sweet.
Outer Banks Sorghum Molasses Brown;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;Outer Banks Brewing Station;Medium brown, little head. Little aroma, faintly sweet. This was a light brown ale, a hint of coffee and chocolate, and a gentle but undefined hop bitterness to dry things out at the end. A fairly standard brown in all aspects, but not a bad one. Wish the exotic ingredients had made their presence felt a bit more.
Onder de Linden Hefe Weissbier;Wageningen, Netherlands;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Bierbrouwerij Onder de Linden;75 cl bottle with simple paper label. Pale blonde. Coreander, citrus and banana in the aroma. Sweetish, wheaty flavor with citrus and touches of coreander. Label says hefe weissbier, but it has style marks of both Belgian and German wheat beers. Nevertheless a nice beer.
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler at JJPM’s palce summer 07. Pours a hazy light orange and a thin lasting head- good lace. Aroma is initially orangey andpine hops whcih are nice but you also get some DMS and vegetal components. Light resins and citrus flavors, pine sap, orange peel, and a light caramel sweeetness- light toast- good bitter finish with more herbal notes in the end. Finishes clean as well.
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Clear gold with a big white head. A solid sweet caramel is bludgeoned with grapefruit, pepper. Intensely bitter, but not overly sharp - the bitterness builds on you. Very good!
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler shared by jjpm74. Golden hazy in color with a nice white head. Hoppy citrusy malty aroma. Piny, orange notes. Malty and hoppy flavor. Orange and grapefruit citrus notes. Nice. Sweet tasting. Finish is bitter. Medium bodied. Nice beer. Drinkable.
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler generously shared by jjpm74 at his gathering. Poured a cloudy golden with a creamy white head. Rich hoppy aroma of pine, grass, and a bit of orange. Really nice. Flavor is somewhat yeasty with notes of grapefruit rind, orange, and some grass. Nice bitterness, yet not overflowing with hop flavor. Although the taste did not live up to the aroma, it was still a tasty double IPA.
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Sampled from a growler on 9/20/06: Pours a clear copper orange with a nicely-lacing white head. Has a sweet caramel and fresh piny grapefruity hoppy aroma. Body starts lightly sweet but very bitter without much flavoring hops. Finishes pretty dry and bittersweet. Could use less bittering hops and more flavoring hops.
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Slightly cloudy copper body with a medium long-lasting off-white head. Typical strong american ale aroma of alcohol, slightly roasted malts and a hint of hops. Rather strong alcohol presence made for a taste that felt more malty than hoppy. Taste was mainly warm malt caramel with some light wooden hops flavours. Mild-medium bitterness. Alcohol felt at least 8.8%, maybe more. Solid beer but not very flavourful. While I was at the brewpub I had three excellent IPAs. It’s ironic that the double IPA was half as good as a regular IPA (it mathematically evens out I guess).
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;"Any first impressions? -Creamy lacing is painted atop the glowing pale amber. -Sandy, wooden hoppiness, and light biscuity maltiness fail to attract the nostrils. -A rough flavor profile still hits efficiently, as oranges, sand, and toast ferociously tango with their targeted tastebuds. -Well-malted and properly carbonated, this mouthfeel has a severity to it which some might tiring. What if you dig deeper? -Soaring sandy, piney hop bitterness has little malt support to ease its fierce approach. -A more constructive malt apport would have been soothing here. -This is a surprisingly average Double IPA from Willimantic; maybe this hop experiment is just not of the right lineage to please my tastebuds. On tap at the brewpub."
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Sampler size sample. An odd take on the dIPA style, this poured with the usual head and with decent lacing. The aroma was of citrus and light pine. The flavor, while it had citrus and pine elements, was lacking a malty rich base that many a dIPA is known to have. The flavor offerred by the malts was also minimal, yet some sort of an odd character was underneat the hops, some funny candy-like aspect? The alcohol was well hidden, hard to believe a dIPA. A decent brew by a brewery that doesn’t confine itself to style guides.
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Growler thanks to mkgrenwel. Poured a golden color with a small off-white head. Sweet malty aroma with a good amount of citrus, sweaty and earthy hops. I thought it was fairly balanced with the sweetness. For me with an IIPA I like unbalance with a huge forward hop profile. But still very good. Nice mixture of malt and hops. Moderate bitterness on the finish. Pretty drinkable.
Willimantic II IPA;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pours gold with a white head. Smells hoppy with some basic underlying malt. Taste is on the bitter side with some floral elements. Not as balanced as other IIPAs I’ve tried from them.
Willimantic Summerfest;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Draught sample at the brewpub. Pours amber with a thin tan head. Smells of perfume, toasted malt, some citrus. Tastes of toast, some earth, a hint of bitterness, some wildflowers. Well rounded and full bodied.
Willimantic Summerfest;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Pours light coppery orange with a nice thin white head and great lace. Aroma is floral and lightly citrus hops and a great bready malt backbone. Great bready doughy light toasted malts int eh flavor cut with a fresh herbal and floral german hops - slight grassiness, perfect moderate bitternesss for the malt used and just insanely drinkable.
Willimantic Summerfest;Willimantic, Connecticut, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Willimantic Brewing Company;Sampler size sample. Poured a pale golden yellow, nice initial head, pretty good lacing. The aroma was malty, some honey and bread. The flavor was comparable to that, rather refreshing with some fruity esters adding to the profile. The mouthfeel was dead on for a summer beer, full enough of flavor yet not thick or heavy. In the big scheme of life, a boring style (and beer), but done quite well within the category.
Ballast Point Anniversary Rocktoberfest Lager;San Diego, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Very dark amber color. Lots of chocolate, bready, a caramelly touch, a bit of cherries. Malty, a bit unbalanced, but not as great as expected, but still not bad. A touch on the sour side. A touch of bread in the finish.

Pours an amber copper with an ok head. Slight butter in the aroma (tons in the flavor), caramel malts, toast, a bit sweet with grassy light hops.

Pours a light ruby-brown with a firm, off-white head. Pretty malty nose, some fruits. Very sweet flavor, plenty of caramel and deep maltiness. Medium in body with nice carbonation. Finishes sugary, a little sticky. A bit sweeter than the Oktoberfest brews I’m used to, and this is an OK thing.
Ballast Point Anniversary Rocktoberfest Lager;San Diego, California, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Location: On tap at the Brewery, Linda Vista Location, 1/7/10 Overall Impression: This was a pretty solid Oktoberfest style beer.

Clear copper orange with a small beige head, fair retention. Light caramel and toasted malts dominate with some lager yeast behind in the nose. I pick up a little ethanol in the flavor and lightly spicy hops. Bitterness peaks @ a 3, semi-dry. Moderate carbonation with a medium body. Not too bad.

Stadin Pullmans D Stout;Helsinki, Finland;Stout;Stadin Panimo;"Draught (""fake"" hand-pump)@Pullmans, Helsinki. Almost opaque black, small but firm tan head. Crisp, menthol like aroma mixed with grass and vegetables. Slightly toasted, a bit sweet porter with chocolaty, roasted aftertaste. Quite boring."
Stadin Pullmans D Stout;Helsinki, Finland;Stout;Stadin Panimo;(Draught, fake-hand-pumped@Pullman, Helsinki) Very dark color with a creamy, beige head. Bitter and roasty, mildly acidic aroma with licorice hints. Ashy-roasty, licoricey flavor with some sweetish maltiness and vegetable hints. Almost medium-bodied, smooth-carbonated palate. A decent stout, but lacks that special something, and is a bit thin.
Sarah Hughes Imperial Stout;Dudley, West Midlands, England;Stout - Imperial;Sarah Hughes Brewery;Cask Stillage from the festival bar at the Brunswick, Derby 29/09/2006 Strong and slightly fruity aroma. Black rich on the palate and very strong in alcohol. A slightly nutty and fruity bitter finish.

A black beer with some loose beige bubbles and a little lacing. The aroma is rich with coffee notes and sour fruits and berries. The taste is very intense with licquorice, coffee and fruit. A little sweet and bitter on the end like a camp coffee. Highly flavourful but not all together wonderfully balanced. Ultimately rich though.
Black Forest Brau Keller Czech Pilsner;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Forest Brau Keller;Draft at the brewery - labeled Proto-Pils: Lemony yellow pour with a spritzy cap that settles into a thin ring. The Hallertau hops own the nose with grassy and piney influences. The body is light and lagery, with subtle hops playing off the bready, nutty malts. A simple beer that works ok - but it lacks that clean, zippy hoppiness that the really great pilsners display. A nice attempt at a tough style.
Black Forest Brau Keller Czech Pilsner;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Forest Brau Keller;Pours a bright clear gold with half an inch of white head. Minimal head retention and just a bit of lacing. Mild lemony-hoppy aroma. Clean crisp and smooth beer that starts out with a hint of sweetness and then is topped by grassy spicy hops.

The mild aroma was malty. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start mediumly tingly at the finish. The flavor contained notes of mild hops. Not one that I would buy again.

Black Forest Brau Keller Czech Pilsner;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Forest Brau Keller;Sample at the brewpub: Clear yellow/gold color with a thin white head that fizzes away pretty quickly. Thin, spotty lacing as well. Saaz hops aroma with a touch of spice. Light-bodied and crisp with low amounts of hops and malt flavor. The finish comes through a little better with a nice hops presence. Overall though this is pretty forgettable.

Coast Range Farmhouse Fresh Hop Ale;Gilroy, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Coast Range Brewing Company;Tap @ Toronado. A wet hop IPA. Golden color with a white head. A citrus aroma, light on the malts but very smooth. A slight mint touch in the flavor. Not as bitter as I would have expected.

Grassy, earthy, slight malt flavor with some spice. Lingering muddled spice and more. It’s a wet hop IPA, but it just comes across as muddled english hops.
Black Forest Brau Keller Oktoberfest;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brau Keller;Reviewed from notes. Is this place still open? I don’t know, but here’s my take on this beer. This was poured into a mug. The appearance was a fairly decent golden yellow to bronzed orange color. There was a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. Lacing, well, there was some, but it wasn’t much. The smell had some openly sweet German malts invading my nose at a fairly decent pace and then lets in a light hellartau (spice) that comes across fairly nice. The taste was mainly sweet and added a fair graininess to it. The hops take a back seat the more it warms, spice - what spice. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. Overall, where’s the Bavarian pretzels, ’cause that’s what I want with this beer - if this place is still open.
Black Forest Brau Keller Oktoberfest;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Black Forest Brau Keller;hazy gold, respectable fluffy off white head. nose of musty malt. flavor is malty with a trace of caramel. medium bodied, dry finish. a touch too mild for me.

Bear Republic Masta Blasta;Healdsburg, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;Rich amber beer with a slight red color and off-white head. Slight lemon citrus aroma with some caramel. Lemony citrus flavor with some grass and malt. Light, drinkable, but too much lemon.
Black Forest Brau Keller American Brown;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Black Forest Brau Keller;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pint glass at the brewery. The appearance was a fairly decent hazy brown color with a bar pour’s kind of slim white film of a head. The smell had a fairly decent earthy to sweet to bitter to somewhat rolling roasty nutty to even just a tad of vanilla in there. Yeah, its there, super slightly, but its there. The taste took those previously stated flavors and combined to taste. Mmmm....it ended up coming across pretty good as it combined. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. The carbonation left a bit to be desired, but no worries as it came across super smooth rolling over my tongue in a super smooth sort of way. Overall, just an absolute wonderful Brown Ale. This is the kind of brown ale that brown ale fans could get behind!
Black Forest Brau Keller American Brown;Frankenmuth, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Black Forest Brau Keller;On draft at brewery.

Atomic Bomb;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Tried at the Great Central Railway beer festival 2018. Aroma of hop fruits and pale malts. Pours golden with diminishing white lace. Taste is medium bitter to lightly sour. Palate is medium bodied, oily texture, average carbonation and a soft sour finish. Not as pungent as promised and the well hopped finish drifts from bitter to sour.
Atomic Bomb;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask conditioned at Harbury Beer Festival ’16, Harbury, Warks. Beautiful, clear amber with white head.

Atomic Bomb;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Clear golden pour wearing an initial white head that rapidly diminishes. Brightly, strongly hopped ale trying to live up to its name. Very dry, floral, orangey and even grapefruity aromas. The light grassiness feels more English already, so does the growing sunflower seed and sesame, cerealic sweet maltiness that we find in mouth. Mostly an aromatic hop bill. Well-balanced and with a grip. Light-bodied, fitting carbonation.
Atomic Bomb;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask at GBBF. Dark golden few head. Hoppy and citric aroma with notes of pine-needles. Flavour of green hops, citric fruit and subtle pale malts. Long bitter finish of grapefruit and resin.

Trondhjem Oktoberfest;Trondheim, Norway;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Trondhjem Mikrobryggeri;Firm white head, amber color. Fruity and refreshing beer, quite complex. It is almost there, but a little too thin, brewing this at a little extra strength would possibly have done the trick. Still, this is a micro to look out for.
Sterling Pur Malt;Villeneuve d’Ascq, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Moulins d'Ascq;Simplistic and clean, both in looks, taste and body. Hopless, disappointing even with my low expectations. Ugly grey head gives rise to a too carbonated body. Yuck. (25cl bottle from Auchan)

Clear pale yellow colour, large and very persistent white head. Sweet malty nose. Light-bodied, yet quite malty. Sweet malt falvours with some rather shy hops.

Amherst Dark Harvest;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Amherst Brewing Company;8 oz draught glass at the brewpub. Opaque, dirty caramel hue, fairly still with no real head....banana-clovey typical German wheat aromas, a bit of dry grass and sweetish chocolate....sweet banana-shake and a bit of sourdough in the body, grassy bitterness towards the end, good caramelized malt backdrop, fairly low carbonation.....a bit of lemon-lime/7Up sorta feeling to the finish though the carbonation isn’t sodalike....mineralic qualities a bit strong. Ehh.
Amherst Dark Harvest;Amherst, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Amherst Brewing Company;A bomb of a beer, poured a light brown color (filtered?), almost non-existent head. Aroma was initially bananas and cloves under some roasted character. The flavor seemed to take on that aspect, but at the same time it hammered each sip with a chemical type off-taste, really off. The chemical taste got disgusting after a few sips, quite sad. Don’t know what happened to this one, but something wasn’t done right.
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;"Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a finger’s worth of eggshell white foamy head that dissipated at a mild pace. Some stringy lace. The aroma had some char/ash, rugged coffee grounds, burnt toast, dried earthy hops and lets in a nice expected smokiness. The flavor lead with the smoke and brought in touches of sweetness melding with the coffee grounds somewhat. Aftertaste is ""char-like"" with some hints of dark chocolate and earthiness. Not much finish, but was somewhat dry. The feel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Sly smoky smoothness strolled along my tongue. Carbonation felt nice. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, pretty nice smoked porter worthy of more pours, but not at the same level as Alaskan’s."
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;A unique flavored beer... as you might guess it tastes smokey. Something to drink by the camp fire on a cold night
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours black with a beige head. Slightly smoky roasty aromas. Roasted slightly bitter charred malts. Finishes dry and roasty. Nothing too special, but decent.
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;Growler- Thanks Mike- Dark deep brown, some head. Growler is about 2 weeks old. Nose is gentle, some smoke and some roast malts. Drinking is easy, great breakfast beer, some smoke in the backround, sweet roasted flavors up front.
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;Tap: Deep brown with some head and okay lace. The aroma has notes of smoke and roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, herbal and citric hops, and some toast. The taste starts with a nice chocolate and toasted malt character supported by some ripe plum and coffee bitterness. The finish is smoky and earthy with a touch of resiny hop. The mouth feel is smooth and dry, chalky and a tad thin. With better mouth feel and depth this would be very good, still quite drinkable and worth a try.
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;Growler courtesy of Pailhead. Very dark brown almost black, minimal head. Big choclate aroma up front, fades to smoke and pine resin. No coffee detectable whatsoever, (this is a good thing for me)! Flavor much the same. Choclate up front, not quite as strong as aroma suggests. Some roasted/burnt grain and just enough smoke to register. Lingering pine aftertaste. Silky smooth palate and mouthfeel. Very well done.
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;Courtesy of my friend Sean Growler: Aroma of moderate smoke, chocolate, and faint roasted coffee. It pours a dark brown with no transparency and a small beige/brown head that quickly fades to a ring around the edges of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate and roasted malt. There is some faint coffee in the background. It finishes with moderate bitter burnt, smoke, and pine flavors with a hint of wood. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. A solid smoked porter.
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Opaque medium brown body, medium cream head. Light chocolatey, roasty aroma (but served too cold). Light sweet body, lactic, with notes of milk chocolate, coffee, and dry roast. Light peaty notes add a salty, leathery characteristic to the beer. Good complexity, but slightly astringent and a bit rough on the palate.
Jamesport Smoky Porter;Ludington, Michigan, United States;Porter - Smoked;Jamesport Brewing Company;Draft at brewpub. Poured dark brown color with an average brown frothy head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate roasted sweet malty with a light smoke aroma. Medium body with a creamy texture.

The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Love this beer! Suggestion- if you start with this beer, you will need to finish with this beer. All of the other beers will not taste normal to you.
The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Bottle pours amber color with off white head. Aroma was bitter hops. Not the best nose I’ve had for this style. Just average. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor was very bitter, has a somewhat nice malt backbone. Again, just average. Finishes dry and bitter. So this was an average brew all around.
The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;22 oz bottle via homebrew Mys Swap 1.0 (thanks crizay!). Ok, so this one comes out as an almost clear amber with an average size beige head. Nose is mellow and i am not picking up a whole lot for an IIPA...just some muted hops..cannot make out much on profile..perhaps some orange and pineapple. Taste starts and ends with the malts....this is more like a wannabe yet thin barleywine than an IIPA. Lots of fruity esters, a bit of fusel alc, some toasted grains, and some subdued earthy/spicy hops. Body is light/medium, carbonation is adequate. THis seems like a beer that has not found it’s identity. Is it a light-bodied barleywine that needs more time? It is certainly closer to that than it is a fresh hoppy IIPA...

The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Bottle...Clear amber ale with a small, creamy, white head. Rich aroma of toffee and caramel with an earthy note of juniper and fruity jolts of peach and orange. Crystal malt flavors of caramel and toffee are beaten down by heavily bitter, earthy hops. Medium-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and prickly carbonation. Lengthy, bitter finish with a topical anesthetic effect on and around my tongue. Thanks, crizay, for sending the bottle!
The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Bottle courtesy of crizay. Pours copper with a nice white head. Smells of citrus, roses, sweet malt, some tangy hints, hints of earthiness. Tastes of tea, pepper, some dry malt, some resiny hop notes. Mouthfeel is full bodied. Finish is bitter and lasting. Not as over the top as many IIPAs I’ve sampled. This one has some depth to it and reminds me more of a ramped up English Pale Ale. Either way, kudos to the brewer!
The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Bottle sampled on 3/12/07: Pours a transparent bright bronze with a large, frothy well-lacing white head. Aroma of sweet biscuity pale malt with some earthy piny hoppy notes. Body starts fairly sweet and pale malty with some toasty toffee notes and some bittering piny hops with a touch of citrusy notes. A decent IIPA.
The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Poured a clear yellow color with a medium sized creamy off-white head. The aroma was of light lemon and citrus. It kind of reminded me of an American Wheat with the lemony notes. The flavor was light and semi-sweet. Lemons but without the tartness. Moderately dry and bitter finish. Light to medium body.
The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;Thanks to the Atlanta crew for sharing. Light gold, white head. Nose is lemon, mango, fruit, light caramel. Flavor is light caramel, bitter catty lemon, slight malty toffee.
The Brew Kettle Dead Poets Imperial IPA;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Brew Kettle;22 oz bottle, bottle conditioned (surprisingly): Light medium amber w/ a lasting off white head. This beer, according to Jeff the bartender is the Olde 21’s little brother! Citrusy grapefruit hops with a heaping helping of piney hops. Younger sibling diacetyl also shows up to annoy his bigger brothers. Lightly toasty and malt presence a bit overshadowed by the hops, but we do the hokey pokey and we turn ourselves about, that’s what it’s all about! Flavor is pretty well balanced, but a bit on the sweet side from start to finish. A good bit of grapefruity and floral hop flavor, but does not quite overshadow the malts like it does in the aroma. Malts are mostly toasty with some caramel with the diacetyl a bit lighter in the flavor than the aroma. Finish is on the slightly sweet side and the aftertaste is a bit hop flavored, but it sort of fizzles in the aftertaste a little bit. Smooth fuller medium body, well hidden alcohol (whatever it might be, Jeff was unsure). A pretty good drinkable beer, save for the diacetyl, which isn’t overbearing, but there.
Hop Back Hop Scotch;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hop Back Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Guide Dog, Soton. Amber colour. Restrained malts with some caramel and fruity sweetness. Dominant factor here are the orangey leafy hops. There is a slight problem with this, in as far as the fresh hop character on occasion comes across as bearing a similarity to the ’freshness’ of some cleaning products. Apart from that its quite pleasant and ends on a tasty mouthfilling bitter finish. Light and enjoyable but doesnt stand up to closer inspection.

Otter Lodge Wet Whiskers Ale;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;IPA;Custom Brewcrafters;Growler from the brewery. Dark amber with a light tan head. Big citric and floral hop aroma with just a hint of caramel.

The head was small, slightly off white in color and faded to a thin, slick ring of lace on top. The aroma had a deep burnt caramel and toasted malt presence with a somewhat spicy and leafy hop aroma. The flavor had a deep muddled malty sweetness. There are notes of burnt caramel, dark molasses and brown sugar that mix with slightly spicy and leafy hops. Overall this gives it a dark and murky character. The finish has more of a hops bitterness popping the deep maltiness as well as some grainy alcohol notes. It has a full body with a heavy, smooth and slightly slick texture and light to average carbonation.

Custom Brewcrafters Oktoberfest Lager;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Custom Brewcrafters;(Growler from Hegedorn’s) CB Oktoberfest is a hazy amber beer with a foamy off-white head with pretty good retention and lacing. The aroma is of pretzels and malt. It’s a simple and soft smell. The are hardly any hops in the nose. When detected, they seem wooden and minty. It is smooth and medium-bodied-- a bit syrupy. The carbonation is prickly and it feels a bit silty. It’s well-balanced. The malt is like a sourdough pretzel. The hops are firm but smooth and quite medicinal. There is almost a quinine aftertaste. This growler made for good drinking in the back yard on a picture-perfect autumn day. Eins, zei, drei, zuffa!
Custom Brewcrafters Oktoberfest Lager;Honeoye Falls, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Custom Brewcrafters;Ah hah! They did it again! Fabulous brew. I was happy. For once in my measly miserable life I was happy. Then it was gone and I could resume my regular status.

Very sweet at first, fading slowly to bittersweet in the finish with gooey plummy notes all the way down. Aftertaste has a bit too much acidity.

Nailsworth The Town Crier;Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Keep Brewing (prev Nailsworth Brewery);Cask conditioned at Stratford upon Avon Beer fest ’07. Brown beer with white head. Expecting a great deal and delivering not very much really, flavour and aroma wise hardly anything, there is a touch of dry tea in the body, it is dryly bitter on the finish with a deeper roasted malt. Unexiting.

Franklins Smokey the Beer;Hyattsville, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Franklins Restaurant, Brewery & General Store;I’ll say it up front, I do not enjoy smoked beers. This came in the sampler glass with an orange color with a frothy white head. Slightly wheaty/grainy aroma just a hint of smoke. Slightly grainy, slightly yeasty flavor but the initial flavor has little smoke. The light smoke flavor comes in at the end which coats the back of the tongue and palate. Not much else here other than the smoke flavor, which I don’t care for to begin with.

Nethergate Portrait (John Constable);Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;"Tasted by half-pint at the Black Bull, a freehouse nr. Whitechapel, East End London, on 13/09/2006. The beer seems to commemorate the famous English painter around late 18th to early 19th century, John Constable, who used to hang out in Essex and Suffolk and painted quite a few landscapes there. Appearance: chesnut red hue, with a fluffy and thin off-white beer head; low carbonation, great clarity. Smell: medium-bodied, mildly sour-sweet apple-ish and pear-ish fruitiness, plus dried-grassy and earthy note of hops. Smooth and simplistic. Taste: lightly roasty bitter-sweetness with a malty tinge of toffee, roast nuts and black tea-leafy hops on a par with the mild entry of peary fruits; the second part of the palate sees an increasingly tangy and dryish bitterness lingering at the back, with a slightly citric-zesty kick to go with the bitter finish, where lots of hops hover in the end. Mouthfeel: softly carbonated, fresh, with fruity malts balanced with a superb length of earthy and roasted hops with a 3D-textured bitterness... A brilliant autumny bitter, aptly named after a lengendary English painter, as this is a true landscape in a glass."
Shady Grove Sparkling Blackberry Thistle Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;Bottle. Pours hazy green-yellow with light carbonation and a small white head that quickly fades. The aroma is sweet honey and some fruit notes, with a distant hint of vanilla. In the mouth, the blackberry hits first giving it a slightly tart beginning, but it smooths into honey flavors in the middle. Lots of vanilla flavor suddenly emerges, almost startlingly so. The finish has touches of sulfur and alcohol. Decent, but not superior.
Shady Grove Sparkling Blackberry Thistle Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;Bottle sampled with Tronraner and cohorts. Pours a light bronze, I was expecting maybe some purplish hues, but no, it’s not there. The nose on this is very tame with light hints of fruits, honey, alcohol. Upon taking a sip, I discover that the vanilla is right up front. I was surprised to find such an easily discerned flavor in a mead from Shady Grove, who usually makes very light, subtles meads. The blackberry comes out faintly in the finish. The whole thing is quite delicate and tart, probably not as enjoyable to me as their standard dry mead.
Shady Grove Poplar/Clover Sparkling Dry Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;Bottle. Pours a very pale hue, almost clear, with light effervescence and high legs. The nose is floral with hints of honey sweetness, alcohol, and some woody notes. The flavor is tart up front and rather floral. The middle is a bit vinous, with a decent honey quality. The finish, though, is weird to me. It reminds me way too much of this wintergreen-scented rubbing alcohol I have. It might not be so offputting if I didn’t make that association, but it’s a bit strange. Ok mead, but not outstanding.
Shady Grove Poplar/Clover Sparkling Dry Mead;Lake City, Tennessee, United States;Mead;Shady Grove Meadery;Bottle, sampled with Tronraner and co. Effervescent, very light pour. The aroma is thin with suggestions of honey comb. This has a light, spritzy mouthfeel with an even, though thin, distribution of honey over the palate. The finish reminds me of sarsaparilla. This is a tasteful drink, but not big enough to sate a true mead craving.
Issaquah Jittery Frog;Issaquah, Washington, United States;Stout;Issaquah Brew House (Rogue Ales);Same as the Eugene City Coffee Stout. This was a really nice, big coffee stout. Pours black with a medium tan head. Tons of rich coffee in the aroma, not overly roasty, but a nice sweet ground coffee smell. Taste had a big blast of fresh coffee. It was nice because it didn’t have the overly roasty, big bitterness that many coffee stouts had, this one relied on more of a sweeter, smoother taste. Medium body, with a nice trailing coffee ground taste. Oh yah, and try this mixed with the rogue chocolate stout for an amazing after-dinner beer.

Desis Tupelo Jubilee Mead;Rougemont, North Carolina, United States;Mead;Desis Dew Meadery;"Bottle. Pours neon yellow with falling legs. It has an interesting molasses-like aroma, kind of ""dark,"" for lack of a better word, with deep wildflower, honey, and cork. The flavor is very floral with some profound honey tones and some syrupy grain notes. Pretty smooth."
Desis Tupelo Jubilee Mead;Rougemont, North Carolina, United States;Mead;Desis Dew Meadery;Bottle consumed alongside Tronraner and crew. This mead pours semi-thick with plenty of tiny little white floaties disperesed throughout the liquid. Even, slowly descending legs are left on the sides of the snifter after a good swirl. This has a very floral, ala hibiscus, nose with not subtle-at-all honey. Oh, and a weird scent of cheese or, less pleasantly, sneakers. Mouth feel is fairly coating and has assertive, though not overdone, honey throughout. Tons of flowers and soft-wood notes refresh my palate. This is decent mead, the one strange thing in the smell is the only real downside in my opinion.

Barbarossa Landbier Dunkel;Schöllkrippen, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Brauhaus Barbarossa;"Draught at the brauhaus Hazy dark amber color. Light caramel aroma; as it often happens for these beers, the hop must not be too aromatic, while the brewer didn’t make the caramel show up more clearly. Good body structure; the caramel flavor is good, maybe very god, round enough, with a limited complementary residual sweetness; correct bitterness. Balanced, and very good."

Elysian Poison Dwarf Scottish-style Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Kind of like a dark aber or red. Not real malty as I would think. Lean on body, easy drinking beer but nothing to it as a Scottish should. .

Elysian Poison Dwarf Scottish-style Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);"Draft @ brewpub. Gorgeous lace! Dark red. Sweetish, brown cakey malts and raisin bread. Balanced by the ""I can’t help myself!"" hops. and alcoholic heat. Alcohol coming out a little too much! Unfortunately. But the hops are powerful. A slow sip allows for a careful study of the beer, which starts with the raisin flavor but that is quickly overshadowed by the hops. Seriously not a Scottish ale, the hops are out of control, but as a seattle parody of a Scottish it works fine. Dates. Ultimately the hops win the battle, although the malts Put up a good fight at first. Won’t be winning awards in its category tho! Very interesting even if more like a hoppy brown"
Elysian Poison Dwarf Scottish-style Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Ruddy amber color, clingy head. Big nose with grassy and piny aromas. Crisp texture ontop a medium malt body. Big hop taste in the middle and end, lingering peppery character. Just a little heavier than an IIPA, but not quite as heavy as something like Bigfoot.

Elysian Poison Dwarf Scottish-style Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);"Draft at Tangletown. Pours a crystal clear rubied garnet. Should have known right away with would not be a typical scottish. Big sudsy light tan head up top. You almost expect to see flecks of milled grain in it, ’cause it looks so much liek bread dough. Big sticky sweet smelling nose, lots of caramel and brown bread, with some floral and light piney hops poking through. Creamy medium body. It’s not quite literally sticky, but, man, is it close. What a malt monster. Brown bread, caramel, maybe a little bit of honey underneath a truly notably hopped flavor profile; there’s earth, some peppery pine, and a nice little resiny bite at the end. The malt bill needs some serious diversification if this beer is to attain greatness, though. It’s a great concept, but right now it’s a super-hopped sticky-sweet brown ale. It needs more peat, smoke, molasses, maybe some leafy bite to the malt. Maybe some roast. I don’t know, but some differentiation has to be there. Still, the pint was easy to put down with gusto. Seeing such obvious room for improvement with simple changes (who doesn’t love buffing out a specialty grain bill?) bodes well for the future."
Elysian Poison Dwarf Scottish-style Ale;Seattle, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);For me this was a nice scotch with not much smoke and moderate bitterness. Very nice smooth malt sweetness. Some wood almost enhances the richness.
Fort Street Eleven!;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fort Street Brewery;Tap: brilliant copper, nice off-white head. Great lacing. Nice malt character up front, caramel and toffee, little subdues but there. Citrus and grass background. Again, caramel and toffee dominate the flavor, just enough hop presence to clean the palate. Amazingly clean brew, very easy drink.

Fort Street Eleven Angry Men;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fort Street Brewery;Cask: dirty amber/mahogany with minimal head.

Hazy amber with a small white head that leaves sporadic lacing behind. Starts with some light caramel and a hint of citrus flavors. Finishes with a moderate ginger and a hint of grassiness.

Aromas include hops, malts, grains, wet socks and some berries. Palate is thin watery, with medium lively carbonation and mouth-feel. Aftertaste is sweet and malty, with some grainy rough notes and medium short hops finish. Overall pretty edgy Pilsener. Not utterly bad , but somewhat unbalanced, the dry bitter edge was enjoyable, however that sweet mash flavor was not.

Taste is relatively dry and extremely grainy, just a really rough mash. A little more alcohol showing than is proper for 4.8%, though there are some occasional floral flutters in the not entirely clean medium body. Drinkable.

Hoppers Bruce's 80 Schilling;Midvale, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Hoppers Grill & Brewery;When we lived in Salt Lake City my wife and I went here all the time. The beers are all excellent. The wings are the best in the state.
Hoppers Bruce's 80 Schilling;Midvale, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Hoppers Grill & Brewery;"On tap at the brewpub. Listed as Bruce’s 80 Shilling, hopefully this doesn’t necessitate an alternative listing, it is the same beer. Pours a amber/red/brown color with a small white head. A light malty nose, some dark fruit notes also. The flavor is very nice; lots of rich fruity malts, somewhat dry, like a huckleberry or boysenberry. Some light bitter hops also. Very full flavored. A nice brew for sure."
Hoppers Bruce's 80 Schilling;Midvale, Utah, United States;Scottish Ale;Hoppers Grill & Brewery;[GABF, Denver Co - 2006] A deep amber color brew. This had a very nice intense Scottish flavor and the smoked peat was very good addition. Te hops and the malts where very good. I liked this brew. I would almost say this is a 90 schilling style.

Taps Istanbul Strong Ale;Istanbul, Turkey;Strong Ale - English;Taps Istanbul Brewery & Restaurant;Süßlich-malziger Geruch, bananig. Malziger Antrunk, etwas wässrig, im Hintergrund findet sich die erschnüffelte hefig-bananige Note. Im Mittelteil wenig kräftiger, die einzelnen vermischen sich, so wirkt das Bier frisch und verwaschen. Im Abgang malziger, der Alkohol ist in angenehmer Weise erkennbar. Die anfängliche Hintergrundnote ist nun im Vordergrund und wirkt deutlich würziger und vollmundig. Das Malz wird im Abgang würziger und rückt mehr und mehr in den Vordergrund, angenehm und aromatisch. So kennt man türkische Biere eher weniger.

Taps Istanbul Strong Ale;Istanbul, Turkey;Strong Ale - English;Taps Istanbul Brewery & Restaurant;Bottle from Migros Supermarket in Bursa: No suitable glass available so drank straight from the bottle. Virtually no fruitiness or much taste at all. The only thing that made me think that this was anything other than a standard light beer (which is the norm in Turkey) was the taste of the Belgian yeast strain. Very dissappointing. This is not a good representation of a Belgian Strong Ale. Granted, the bottle could have been sitting in the cooler for god-only-knows how long.

Ninkasi Fresh Hop Ale (2006);Eugene, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Tasted at 2006 Portland fresh hop fest--Not a very hoppy tasting fresh hopped beer, but very smooth and well balanced. Comes across more like an exemplary pale ale.
Ninkasi Fresh Hop Ale (2006);Eugene, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);On tap at Horse Brass Pub, Portland. Hazy gold, no head. Raspberries.

Ninkasi Fresh Hop Ale (2006);Eugene, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Yah, i’m with steve on this one, this was one funky brew, just tasted like sweet wort. The finish tasted sweet and cloudy with got in the way of any good fresh hop tastes. I’m hoping when i have this next week at the fresh hop fest in portland its better, cause this is the first bad brew i’ve had from Ninkasi.
Ninkasi Fresh Hop Ale (2006);Eugene, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Tap at Hood River Hops Fest. This dog should have been put down long before it reached the public. Pours a medium amber color and fairly clear, scant white head that fades quickly and little lacing. Aroma is freshly boiled wort. Thick and syrupy, plenty of IBU’s. Taste is far too sugary to even have gotten half way through fermentation. Seriously, this beer tastes like wort would if it were carbonated. A true shame that this was served...
Leatherbritches Ready 4 It;Ashby De La Zouch, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Leatherbritches Brewery;A light straw gold coloured beer with a thickish white head. The nose is light, with a distinc citrusy hop aroma, lemony and a touch of grapefruit. The taste is dry, slightly sharp, with the citrus fruit elements from the smell coming through, again lemon and grapefruit. The finish is dry and fruity. (Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heachan, Norfolk).
Alandale Pilsner;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Pour is a golden with a nice whie head. Aroma is a nice crips pils malt with a decent amount of clean hops. Flavor is in the decnt category with a nice biscuit and grain. Hops do show up which is where many pils fall short. A pretty decent offering.
Alandale Pilsner;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;On tap at the Heritage Brew Festival 2008.

Alandale Pilsner;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;This was their best beer by far. It had a nice hop aroma and bitterness. The malting was light, but not overly light like BMC-type pilsners. It was overall just a decent beer.
Alandale Pilsner;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;tap at Augusta bottoms beerfest-Pours light yellow with a small soapy white head. nose is very grassy, kind of like the trampled grass that we are standing on during this beerfest (the fest was in 2 tents out in the middle of the Missouri River valley). Nice flavor profile here-nice grassy/spicy hops with a malt structure that is definately not like most of the ilk-not soggy or boring. very tasty, classic and true to style. Nice body with medium carbonation. doesnt feel flimsy at all. very dry and spicy hoppy finish. I totally dig this beer from this new brewery! I actually voted this beer best in show due to its solidness and how true to style it is.
Alandale Pilsner;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Sampled at Augusta Bottoms Beer Festival 2006. Pours clear yellow with light carbonation and small white head. Aroma was quite grassy and husky with a hint of hops. Light / medium body with some sharp carbonation that was great for the style. The taste had the husky graininess that works well with pilsners and a big spicy hop finish. On one hand it is nothing earthshattering, but it is a very well done solid pilsner that doesn’t have the negative characteristics that mar so many others. My first beer from this new brewery & I look forward to many more.

Alandale American Wheat Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Draft sample at Alandale. Very light and hazy, still can see bubbles rising through the glass. A fine wheat smell. Has the standard zest of an American wheat with no out of place esters. Just a nice light drink.
Alandale American Wheat Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Wow, this is a bad beer. There was almost no noticeable aroma, a poor, soapy head with large bubbles, and almost no flavor profile that I could detect. It tasted like an even lighter Bud Light, if that is possible. I want to like this brewpub, I really do! I live not 2 miles from the place, and I want to see it do well because I want a good, local watering hole, but I just cannot stand these bad beers.
Alandale American Wheat Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;tap sampled with vyvvy at the Augusta Bottoms Beerfest. Poured very cloudy yellow, especially for an american wheat, with a small soapy head. fruity nose with light husky notes. somewhat estery as well (nice yeast tone). lightly fruity flavors with some spicy hops on the finish. body is light, but its not watery. This would be an awesome session beer on a hot august day here in STL. One of the best AW i have ever had.

Lake Superior Puddingstone Light;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;tap at the brewpub - Pours very pale, hazy yellow-green with a small, lingering white head. It has a light, citrus accented aroma. The flavor is light and sweet. Unfortunately it’s also a thin, watery beer with some off bandage like flavor. Not good.
Lake Superior Puddingstone Light;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Rating these in the order sampled… Watery brew with virtually no head and not much aroma. Light bodied and light amber in color. At first I thought I detected a nice lemony citrus sensation when I sniffed it, but that was just the lemon hunk in it. Flavor dominated by a clean bitter wheat and yeast combo at the end of the swallow. My sample was a bit warm and the weak, watery, and warm combo didn’t work well for me. Not much else there. For a light beer – it is good. Had I known this was a light beer, I would have passed it by – the sign aobe the bar just said “Puddingstone Wheat.” In a way, I’m relieved to discover (here on ratebeer) that is a light and so the taste merely reflects on the compromises inherent in brewing something like that, and not on the brewer’s skill. (Yeah – I know – I should reign in the fawning compliments.)
Lake Superior Puddingstone Light;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Thin lightly hazed yellow pour. Rim of white. Light skunky waft of malt. Distant corn tinged sugars of faint malt. Carboard and coarse grain. Palate has a smack of toast and weak plants. Body isn’t bad, but why beat up an American Wheat as your entry level blonde? This comes across as a Broberon Bud Light.
Uncle Stuarts Strumpshaw Fen;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Strong Ale - English;Uncle Stuarts;Bottle. (Brief tasting notes and rating from old records) - BCA – Strong, citrus-fruity, malty, slightly sweet golden ale. Dry malty finish. (Backlog)

Pours hazy brown, autumn leaves aroma, tickling bitter biscuit with a slight hint of whisky for some reason. Not that bad despite being 5 months out of date.
Uncle Stuarts Strumpshaw Fen;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Strong Ale - English;Uncle Stuarts;Jan 2009: Brown 500ml bottle conditioned beer, poured into a straight Uk pint glass with 6 months life left according to the bottle. I wanted to pour it slowly and leave the sediment in the bottle, I failed. The beer looked clear and a pleasant amber/brown until I got excited and the glass became the home of a murky brown liquid with a wispy white head on top. It looked like a beer your mate has brewed, but couldn’t wait for it to clear before offering you a pint. My appearance score reflects my stupidity. Hops and yeast, yeast and hops, sorry, reminds me again of a mates good homebrew. Hold on thought. There is a richness in the aroma that carries on into the taste and mouthfeel too. The taste is bitter and hoppy (English Goldings and Progress hops), I found it a very good blend of flavours with a tangy, spritzy feel to the whole experience. As I mentioned above, the beer has a richness, there is a depth of body too, which I can only assume comes from the high alcohol content. The alcohol is well hidden because of the complexity of the brew. I have mentioned homebrew in this review a couple of times, but this beer is well above any homebrewers products I have ever had.

Woody aroma with hints of cardboardy oxidation. Some sharp fruit and sweet malt underneath. Fruity on the palate. Finishes quite tart, maybe a touch sour.

Sweet and sour, also fruity with the strength noticeable. All things considered this is really a fairly poor bottled beer, its a lazy sludgy mess that barely deserves the mark I’ve given it.

Kirkwood Station Amber Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Sampled at the Highlands Brewery. Not a bad amber ale. It had a medium, caramel body with a slight citrus. It was a normal Amber Ale, different, but not bad as many other Ambers Ales.

First beer I’ve had here that shows American hops; not at APA strength, bit a bit of citrus and pine to make it interesting."

Kirkwood Station American IPA;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;IPA;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Medium Amber. There’s a big malt component to this, with just a light flourish of hop ... I’d call it British more than American. (#6264, 8/7/2016)
Kirkwood Station American IPA;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;IPA;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Part of a sampler flight at the brewpub, on draft. It poured a pale orange amber colour, slight chill haze, with white foam, short-lived but left behind lace. Crisp grains, slight caramel sweetness dominated by intense US hops: grapefruit, tangerine, black currant, cedar, dank resin. Light body, strong carbonation, dry finish with lasting hoppy bitterness and flavour. A very familiar flagship A- IPA overall, but well-crafted and tasty. Cascade and Chinook get the job done every time.
Kirkwood Station American IPA;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;IPA;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Bottle. This was a mess. Smelled ok but had buttery notes really killed this one
Kirkwood Station American IPA;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;IPA;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Shared 16 oz. cans poured to snifters, displaying a coppery gold color, with a presentable, off white head, and spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was dank, with a little cattiness, dryness, and esters as grapefruit. Medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the hop presence was also medium intensity, citrusy, earthy, and lingering, as the taste was basically dry, with no discernible sweetness, and suitable malt to temper the hops. A standard IPA, but the drier impression agreed with me as a nice change from the usual fruity or malt sweetness of most IPAs.
Kirkwood Station American IPA;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;IPA;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Can @ home. Hazy amber pour with a fluffy khaki head. Nose is heavy on lemon and pine. A fair amount of grass. Lightly floral. Lots of caramel maltiness and some toast. The flavor has a rather intense caramel quality. A big toffee note, too. Some bitter pine and grass. Orange peel and candied lemon peels.

Kirkwood Station American IPA;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;IPA;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Flight pour on tap at the brewery (Kirkwood, MO). Pours a deeper amber copper hue, well hazed with frothy offwhite head atop. A nice layer, good ring and mellow lacing overall. Aromas are gentle citrus hops, a touch of florals, faint fruit and bready malts, bit of caramel and biscuit. Sweeter, muted. Touch of grapefruit as it settles more. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, some decent bittering hops show some grapefruit, touches of florals and gentle fruit. Some biscuit, gentle sweeter malts into thje middle show caramel, gentle biscuit and bready malts. A touch sweeter but not overwhelming. The knock here Is that the hops are a little overdone when they could do more. Backend is a bit bitter, earthy with gentle bready and carmelized malt elements. A touch sweet, underdone. The hop elements do show some nice jabs at tomes and the maltbill is efficient.. It just needs some more hop oomph. At times, it’s nice, at others it’s a bit sweet. Meh. It’s ok. I’d drink it.
Kirkwood Station American IPA;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;IPA;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Pours a hazy light amber with a white head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has notes of light citrus and grass backed by earthy grains.

Schell Stout;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;August Schell Brewing Company;This is a backlog rating from 2011 from a bottle shared by Tmoney99, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time.

A well made stout that compares well to Guiness. Try it with with smoked cheese and crackers.
Schell Stout;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;August Schell Brewing Company;Dark brown pour, large tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Start is malty with caramel overtones, then reveals the chocolate & coffee flavors. Finish is smooth with no surprises. Not much bitterness, not an emphasis on hops. Pleasant, a brew for the summer months: light for a stout.
Schell Stout;New Ulm, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;August Schell Brewing Company;This is the best of Schell´s lineup. That being said, it is still quite thin and unremarkable.

Morgan Street Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Morgan Street Brewery;Shaker pint draft at the Morgan Street Brewery in St. Louis, Missouri. The pour is a mostly clear copper golden with a small light tan head. The aroma is nut, caramel and a bit of toasty malt.

Morgan Street Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Morgan Street Brewery;12 oz. can via in-person STL trade. Pours a clear orange-amber color with an inch of khaki head that dissipates quickly into a lasting uneven film. Notes of toast, caramel, tobacco and other dried leaves, subtle spice, and a little fruit. Light-bodied, with medium carbonation and a crisp, toasty mouthfeel. Solid Oktoberfest.
Morgan Street Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Morgan Street Brewery;The color of this brew is a dark orange color with a large white head, and the aroma blends the scents of dough yeast and caramel malts. The taste is mildly sour and a touch sweet although this blend is quite nice, and the palate combines a medium body, thick texture, average carbonation, and a sour yet fairly abrupt finish.
Morgan Street Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Morgan Street Brewery;Pour is a brown with a large white head. Aroma is a nice rich caramel malt. Flavor is the same. Decent maltyness but a little watery around the edges. Leaves a little breadyness on the tongue after the swallow. It’s decent but again a bit to watery to give it a higher score.

The aroma was of some caramel, malts and a hint of fruit. The taste was of spices, some clover and notes of caramel. A decent Oktoberfest.
Morgan Street Oktoberfest;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Morgan Street Brewery;Tasted at the 1st annual Urban Chestnut - Wolpertinger beer festival in St. Louis, MO, USA from tap into sampler beer boot. Labelled as Märzen, but I assume it’s the same brew. Poured a nice clear orange-amber color with decent white foam. Aromas and flavors true-to-style. Rich malt sweetness, mildly caramelly, noticeable Munich malt. Light body, strong carbonation, crisp lager finish.

Aroma was caramel, malts and banana. Flavor was spices, clover, and caramel. Some malty, candy finish to it. Kind of weak, and watery. Not a very good beer, but still very drinkable.

The beer is clear and golden with amber. A lightly spicy aroma with malt. The flavor is grassy for an oktoberfest. It has light spices. This is not a great beer.
Power Plant 8-8-8 Imperial IPA;Parkville, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Does indeed seem to be a different recipe than their 6th Anniversary IIPA. Suitably hoppy aroma, tinged with tangerine, orange, grapefruit and berry accents, some faint pine and flowers here as well along with some faint background honeyish malt sweetness. Mostly clear medium-dark golden amber color with a slight head. Flavor is a bit different than aroma would indicate, with some bubblegum sweetness up front, more pine and citrus dominating the middle and finishing with a good amount of bitterness and hop flavor, accompanied by a relatively gentle alcohol presence. Some cidery and cereal malt notes amidst the hops here. Body is a bit lighter than anticipated, the palate oily and smooth. Pretty basic interpretation of the style but not bad.
Power Plant 8-8-8 Imperial IPA;Parkville, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled at the Augusta bottoms beerfest alongside vyvvy. Read his description about how this beer was poured-you will get a laugh. pours turbid brown (yes, brown) with a very small white head. tons of hop floaties from the dry hopped cask, which stick to the sides of the glass. If drug tests looked for alpha acids, then i would fail badly! nose here is chalk full of a tub of hops-everything you can imagine-pine, resin, citric, grapefruit, wood. however, the flavors are very resinous with some earthy/piney character. Also, the hops were fresh, so the green hop character is there as well, malt? what malt-this is liquid hops. For what it is, its definately not great for the style. however, this beer was novel, unique and definately had to experience this one first hand. the 9% was nowhere to be found, until after the 3rd sample.
Power Plant 8-8-8 Imperial IPA;Parkville, Missouri, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled at Augusta Bottoms Beer Festival 2006. Poured somewhat from the cask. There was some much hop residue this was not able to come out of the cask in the normal fashion. It was periodically drained into a pitcher and poured from there. It is probably needless to say, but this is very hoppy. Pours brownish orange with lots and lots of sediment and very little head. The aroma has a multitude of hop qualities - grapefruit, wood, pine, spice, etc with lots of resin. Medium body that is light for the style and the aroma. Almost no carbonation in the beer. The initial taste is fairly light with some hops and fruity-like malt. The finish however is a hop bomb having woody and piney hops in the forefront. Lots of resin is in there. Very very dry finish that is a little harsh. Quite interesting take on the style.
Power Plant Espresso Stout;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Stout;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Full black pour, smallish head. Aroma is all coffee, with maybe a twinge of roast malt. Taste is medium bodied with the espresso taste right up front, though nicely blended and balanced. Overall a decent beer.
Power Plant Espresso Stout;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Stout;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;tap at Augusta Bottoms Beerfest alongside vyvvy. pours pretty much black with a light brown tinge around the glass even when held up to the sun. aroma screams expresso beans-fresh ones! flavors are all expresso with some nice chared bean notes. really not much beer here, but this could pass for coffee in a mug-seriously! i could drink this at work and nobody woud know. body is somewhat thin, but really not detracting. cool and novel beer here.
Power Plant Espresso Stout;Parkville, Missouri, United States;Stout;The Power Plant Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled at Augusta Bottoms Beer Festival 2006. Poured blacker than night - I couldn’t get anything but black even when held to the sun. There is also a good looking brownish orange head. The aroma is all dark expresso with beer not being detectable. Medium / light body with little carbonation. Much lighter than you would think for something this dark and aroma so bold. The taste is all expresso with not much of a beer taste. This is great if you are a big coffee fan.
Golden City Hefeweizen;Golden, Colorado, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Golden City Brewery;tap. hazy golden thin head. big yeast and banana aroma. tastes the same. way too much banana. one dimensional. bogus.
Seabright West Coast Wheat;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Seabright Brewery;Sampled at the brewpub. I requested that they not include a lemon slice on the rim. Pours a cloudy pale straw color with a decent white head. Aroma is faint, and predictably consists of phenols from the wheat. Taste is watery, of faint banana and clove, with a hint of floral hoppiness. Thin bodied, well-carbonated. This makes a good beer for a scorching hot day if it’s served cold. Maybe that lemon would have helped the lackluster flavor out.
Seabright West Coast Wheat;Santa Cruz, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Seabright Brewery;Standard American Wheat. The description claims to have lots of hops... don’t get your hopes up. This is your standard bland wheat beer with not much aroma, flavor, or body.
Genuine Western Draft (GWD);Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Big Rock Brewery;"This beer is not to be confused with Pacific Western Genuine Draft that is brewed in Prince George B.C. This beer is a ""house brand"" marketed by the Sobeys grocery store chain, and available only in their proprietary liquor stores. It is very cheap-- I paid $4.14 for a sixpack! And considering the price, the beer is actually not bad at all. Standard pale lager fair, but there is none of the bad stuff that makes the cheap ones so nasty. Fresh grainy and bready aroma, clean palate with noticable pale malt, and a slightly bitter finish make this a decent beer. I would choose it over Canadian any day!"
Tugboat Nut Brown;Portland, Oregon, United States;Brown Ale;Tugboat Brewing Co.;On tap at the Tugboat Oct. 6, Pours very dark. Despite being very dark it smells insanely hoppy and does not have a strong malt smell. Taste is too hoppy also with a little hint of malt but not nearly enough. No nut taste at all, and doesn’t coat the mouth very well. Disapointing.
Stensbogaard English Dark Stout;Ringe, Denmark;Stout;Stensbogaard Bryghus;Close to black body with a small, frothy, short-lived, tan head. Sweet, strong aroma of dark caramel, dark chocolate, sweet liquorice, dark roasted malt, and coffee in the back. Fairly strong flavour of dark roasted malt, sweet liquorice, alcohol, and coffee, and faint dark caramel. Light to moderate sweet taste with a moderate to light bitter finish. Mid-bodied, watery texture, close to flat carbonation. Fairly decent. [50 cl bottle, enjoyed 9 months before BB date, from Dagli' Brugsen Blokhus, Jylland, Denmark]
Stensbogaard English Dark Stout;Ringe, Denmark;Stout;Stensbogaard Bryghus;A danish, black oatmeal stout with low, brown head. Aroma is heavy liqourice, light coffee, light prune. Taste is bitter.
Stensbogaard American Brown Ale;Ringe, Denmark;Brown Ale;Stensbogaard Bryghus;Copenhagen 24/8 2018. 50 cl bottle from Meny. Stensbogaards usual design with a black label with a orange stripe. Pours clear dark brown with small white head. Settles as thin patchy layer of foam crawling of the side of the glass. No lacing. Aroma is sweet, Glue, brown sugar, nuts and metallic alcohol (impressive for a beer with an ABV of around 5). Light carbonation and thin, watery texture. Flavor has fairly strong sweetness followed by moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is bitter. Lingering. Not a wholehearted take on a Brown Ale. Disappointing.
Hoggleys New Brewery Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hoggleys;Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. A copper coloured beer with a dry aroma featuring a little grass. The taste is malty and dry. Ordinary really.
Hoggleys New Brewery Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hoggleys;Cask conditioned at The Turf Tavern, Oxford. Amber with white head. Reasonable enough session bitter, crisp, refreshing, easy going malts, a little sweet with a touch of caramel, then a dose of bittering hops. Good enough.
Hoggleys New Brewery Bitter;Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hoggleys;Cask at Bedford BF ’06. Dark amber. Peppery hop aroma. Enjoyable malty flavour with some sourness and a mid bitter finish. Decent, tasty beer.
Castle Rock Nottingham Pale Ale;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;From cask. Pours dark brown with no lasting head. Roasted malt and breadish. Roasted malt, mild fruity and with a light bitterness coming through. Crisp fruity bitterness into the finish.
Castle Rock Nottingham Pale Ale;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Smells like a basket of fruit. Pours a dull golden color. I really enjoyed it right off the top, the hops hit you like a brickwall. I will definitely be smuggling some back.
Castle Rock Nottingham Pale Ale;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Pale straw colour, small white head. Sweet, soapy floral aroma, slightly artificial and not very promising. Taste begins similarly, but soon delivers a grape and apple fruitiness with a pleasant strawy aftertaste. A long, intense bitter finish. This is one of those beers that you don’t like at first, but ends up being rather appealing.
Shed Miel Devient;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Draught samples at Kennett 06 and Boston’s Belgian Beer Fest 06 Lightly hazy golden beer, very saison like in appearance, with tiny bubbles apparent in the liquid and a medium amount of well-retained white head that provides plenty of lacing. Light honey fermentation notes in the nose (pepper, flowers, light medicinal notes and some vanilla) immediately complement the delicate B. Brux fruitiness. Some more residual sugar than Substance D seems to give the beer more an Orval-like note, with a moderate hoppiness, lots of perfume, lilacs and fresh grass. Very strong aroma, growing very tart, lemony and lightly herbal-astringent on the end. Honey dabbled over biscuits, with some very soft suggestions of light caramel are the extent of the malt notes. Not lactic or acetic, but just very dry fruit skin notes from the brett. Both sour and tart at once, in the flavor, from the honey (which lends a light bittersweetness) and the very tart, and very prominent brett. Meanwhile, plenty of spicy notes form all over the palate, not being anywhere overdone. Engaging carbonation, and a moderate level of it help keep things very bright and crisp. Some sharp esters grow apparent with warming, as well as just a touch of alcohol warmth, and definitely some spicy phenols, but some (hops?) are noted on the end, adding some hay and grass notes and bringing the beer back down to earth. Touch of sweet honey on the finish and plenty of light dough and vanilla. The Kennett version had a very large amount of diacetyl, nearly ruining the beer for me. Shaun thought it was an infected keg with pediococcus adding the diacetyl, and I believe it, it reminds me of the diacetyl issues with RR’s supplication. The keg at BBF was flawless, however. Score is for the BBF version
Shed Miel Devient;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;First sample at the KSBF 06. Pours a cloudy gold and acloudy fluffy white head- and great lace. Aroma is brett upfront wiht some fresh cut hay, light herbal spiciness and phenolic- sour as well. More lemony tarteness in the flavor- full bready malt with lots of farmhouse funk and stinky wild yeast and cheese. Full body despite an obviously low OG and finishes off very tart and sour- almost lambic-like. Great brett-laced saison.
Shed Miel Devient;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;KSBF 2006. Hazy deep lemon body with a modest white head. Ultra-bretty aroma with elements of grapefruit, barnyard, organic honey, nuts and wheat. Very dry, moderately tart and wild flavor with an oaky bitterness. Some nice, unexpected texture. Very enjoyable beer.
Shed Miel Devient;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;KSBF 2006. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma of brett, funk, citrus, barnyard, honey and some yeast/spice. Flavor of the same kind of a bready/honey tinged spicy Saison. Good stuff!
Shed Miel Devient;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at KSBF ’06... Appears a hazy light gold with a fluffy white head that doesn’t fade out. Lots of spotty lacing is left around the glass. Smell is of honey infused lemon with some yeasty spiciness followed up with a subtle brett aroma that doesn’t overpower. Taste is of the same aromas with a balanced amount of brett that compliments the zesty, smooth honey flavors with a wild flare. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fluffy, like a chardonnay that has been aged and opened at the right time. Well done, Shaun!
Shed Miel Devient;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the KSBF ’06. Poured a deep and cloudy golden color with an averaged sized white head. Aromas of honey, lemons, brett, and some spices. Tastes of honey, brett, citrus and spices. I’m usually not crazy about honey, but found that I really enjoyed this beer. Refreshing and one of my favorites of the connoisseur tasting.

Victory Harvest Ale;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Pours a burnt orange color. In tulip glass. Has a good cream color head, about one finger, but thick. Good retention. Very thick, clumpy lacing. Looks great. Aroma is peach! Grapefruit! Wow! Biscuity. Floral. Taste is citrusy, orange peel. It’s sweet, but quickly turns bitter. Well balanced. Taste isn’t as good as the aroma, but breathing it in as you drink it, sort of makes up for that. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Crisp, dry. Juicy. Overall, this is really good. Very enjoyable. I would recommend it, and I would buy it again.

Victory Harvest Ale;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"Copper and toffee coloured body with a smallish, single centimetre tall off-white head and a bit of an amber glow as well. Aroma of fresh grassy, floral and perfumey hops with a nice malt and toffee scent as well. Medium-bodied; Strong biting floral and grassy hoppy flavours up front with a smooth and sweet caramely and biscuity malt presence along with some dry herbal flavours and a touch of sugar at the end - very well balanced. Aftertaste shows some grain, a bit of caramel, a good deal of dryness and a lot of floral, grassy and very perfumey hop characteristics along with a great balance of malt throughout. Overall, a very nice fresh hopped APA with some good dry elements and a very well struck balance between the hops and the malt. Definitely worth trying (especially fresh) if you can find this! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Total Wine in Alexandria, Virginia on 15-November-2016 for US$3,24 sampled at home on the Eastern Shore of Virginia on 14-January-2017."

Arran Milestone;Isle of Arran, Strathclyde, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Arran;Bottle in a pub on Arran. Hazy blond with a thin off white head. The taste is lightly sour with some toasty notes in the finish. Quite pleasant as a sour ale, but I strongly suspect that this bottle is infected.

Arran Milestone;Isle of Arran, Strathclyde, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Arran;500ml Bottle as a gift from Arran, Scotland: Strong fruity notes with some orange, lemon and a slightly tropical aroma with some passion fruit in the mix. Some acidity followed by a sweetness and hops but overall it is the blend of fruits that dominates. The smell isn’t particularly well balanced and is overly strong sadly. Copper with a thumb-sized, creamy white head on top that holds remarkably well over. Fruity orange & tropical fruit flavors with some hops & some spice too. Strong citrus with some hints of caramel interspersed with various of hints of fruit. Medium bodied and very fruity throughout with a slight citrus tang and hints of alcohol too. The carbonation is medium to high and the finish is a sweet one. Not a beer I was particularly impressed with poor balance. Orange & tropical fruits dominate from the offset and neither being particularly enjoyable. The beer also seemed over-carbonated and just didn’t sit well with me for one reason or another.
Arran Milestone;Isle of Arran, Strathclyde, Scotland;Strong Ale - English;Arran;Tried the Arran range while visiting and brought a crate back. Lovely amber ale, citrusy and with a dry finish.

Lake Superior Pumkin Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;Only beer I’ve ever had by this brewpub. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color. Bar pour yields no head. The smell had some cinnamon and pumpkin. Light ginger is inviting. The taste was mainly sweet but carried a nice spicy connotation about it. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there but was standard for the style, nothing bothersome. Overall, good pumpkin ale worthy of having again.
Lake Superior Pumkin Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;I had this one over two years ago, but it has left an undying memory in my mind as one of the finest seasonal beers ever brewed and drank.
Lake Superior Pumkin Ale;Grand Marais, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Lake Superior Brewing at the Dunes Saloon;On tap at the brewpub. A cloudy thin yellow whitish tinged pour, with a rim of white. Distant aroma of cinnamon grease. A very saccharin pumpkin pie spice flavor, with a far away maly dingyness. Not enough body or nice maltiness to carry the pumpkin spice. The palate has a real dry cinnamon pithyness. Overall, weak.
Asahi Gubinama!;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;Can: Pale gold color, drank from a can so I’m not sure on the waveformation on the head retention. The nose is lightly grassy with some light husk and sweet malt. A bit sharp in the malt department, with very little adjuncts in the finish. Clean, a bit acidic on the palate. Decent product.
Asahi Gubinama!;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;slighty lemony, seltzer water... weird. tastes more like a bad wine cooler? or perhaps, a weird chu-hi? i’d rather have chu-hi!!!
Asahi Gubinama!;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;"The second of three new brews for ""Japanese Swill Night"". This one looks like the last, another horrid offering from Asahi called ""Style Free"". This one has a bit more gold to it and the head flat out disappeared in record time. Not much of an aroma, what is there reminds me of a damp mop that was used yesterday to clean up spilled lemonade. Doesn’t taste much better. Not sure which was more a pathetic excuse of beer between this and the last one. Basically, both suck."
Asahi Gubinama!;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;"My wife informed me that this is not beer at all but a substitute that is supposed to be ""Healthy"" for people who want to drink beer but have stomach problems, organic. ""Gubinama"" means ""Gulp Drink"" , Japanese love onomatopoeias. Little watery and hoppy. Lots of carbonation, dont drink too much of this stuff please."
Asahi Gubinama!;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;Light yellow colred, fastly vanishing white head. Lively carbonation. Lemon dominates in aroma, some fruity honey in there too. Thin to medium bodied. Flavor is very thin and watery, some unclean corn with sweet touch. Mildly dry aftertaste with some lemon. Carbonated palate.
Asahi Gubinama!;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;Can. Clear deep golden color, no head. Sweet malty and grainy nose. Watery, cardboardish, very thin (especially for 5% beer). Some sour notes in the finish. Very plain and watery. Much worse than eg. Asahi Super Dry.
Asahi Gubinama!;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Asahi Breweries;Canned. Pale golden colour, no head. Aroma is quite non-existant, some slight malts and rice. Flavour is not much either, slightly hoppy. Easy to drink, but I almost drink water rather than this if I am thirsty. Alcohol also shows up a bit, as there’s not much else to cover it...
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;Thanks to whoever game me a pour from their growler at DLD. I haven’t had the normal bender so I really can’t compare. Poured a light brown color. Aroma was bready, nutty with a bit of bourbon. Taste was much the same, distant bourbon, light nuttines, I thought it was sort of watery overall and a little thin. I have had some great surly brews, and this just didn’t quite do it for me. Not hard to drink, but not outstanding.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;poured from a growler on DLD. thanks for the person who shared this with our table..... poured a dark caramel brown with a bubbly edge of barely noticeable head.... aroma was of light bourbon and somewhat nutty..... flavors of a small amount of bourbon and lightly toasted. mouthfeel was a bit watery and thin.... must try this fresh of the tap one of these days.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;on tap at DLD 08. thanks to whoever walked about with a growler of this. pours brownw ith tan head. a bourbon and nutty aroma. flavors are nutty, bourbon, caramel. and a real smooth finish. a solid beer and it actually works. bender shows he can be used well in many ways.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;(Draft) Pours an amber-brown body with medium beige head. Aroma of toastiness, rye bread, vanilla, fig, and chocolate. Flavor of oak, vanilla, toasted/caramel malts, rye, and light chocolate with a dry finish.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;FOBAB 07.Surly’s not living up to its reputation so far! Dark cola with beigeish head on the pour. Nose of bourbon caramel, vanilla, chocolate malts. Flavor is just off it seems, very blah. Sweet with small bitterness and bigtime alcohol.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;On tap at FoBAB 5. Poured clear, deep reddish-brown with a light cap of beige head. The aroma picked up sweet caramel and chocolates with lesser oak and vanilla.. not much bourbon was perceptible.. lighter and quite complex (especially from a brown ale!). The flavor had vanilla, sweeter chocolates, toasted oak, and marshmallows throughout.. very tasty.. drier and a touch light right at the finish. Sweet and very enjoyable on the palate.. lighter-bodied, complex, and a great feel throughout.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;FoBAB 2007: Dark brown with a fading head. The nose detects vanilla, walnut, fig, plum, caramel and bready vapours. The taste starts twangy and lactic like with a rich bready layer of malt under in all. The finish is oaky, nutty, and quite dry for a brown ale. The mouth feel is sticky and soft and as mentioned quite dry upon the finish. Not too shabby but I would have liked to see a bit more malt driven character.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;ABR 2007. Funky oak and bourbon of the malty nose. Vanilla, oaks and a faint sourness in the body. Some hops survived. Not bad.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;Draft at ABR 07. Poured a nice medium to dark brown with a tan head. Nice roasteed sweet malt on the nose, but the bourbon shines a little more on this than the darkness, and I am a little over that character in beers. Still very nice, but not as good as I had hoped.
Surly Bourbon Bender;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Brown Ale;Surly Brewing Company;First beer sampled on draught at the ABR 07 in Minneapolis, MN. Pours a semi-clear dark brown brew with a fast dissolving tan head that leaves behind an off-white head and some film on the brew top. Aroma of distinct bourbon and aged oak wood with a touch of dark caramel malt. Taste is creamy, smooth, slightly syrupy with more coconut and bourbon flavors than hops and malt. Finish has a slight hop bitterness that quickly disappears to a light bourbon aftertaste.
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;Half stein pour. Copper pour with a slight white head. Metallic, roasted malt, sugar. Taste is roasted malts, caramel, candi sugar. Bit of a bitter bite. Not bad. easy drinking.
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;"Reviewed from notes. Pours a medium reddish brown with a a bit of an off white head. Nose brings forward some caramel as well as slightly-toasted bread. The taste is definitely a malt bomb, with no hops at all to speak of. Some slightly-sweet caramel along with a bit of roasted toast. Mouthfeel is medium; a bit heavy for the style, and it works alright. Decent depth of flavor. I’d say it’s a pretty decent American version of the style. Serving type: growler Reviewed on: 10-15-2010"
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;(Sample Date: 9/19/2009 Source:Other) Courtesy of Madison. Accentuated malt aroma with light spicy hop notes. Mostly clear amber brown. Spicy upfront bitterness over caramelized malts. Finish is dry and moderately bitter.
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;Enjoyed this one from 7.5 gallon keg purchased at the brewery in Fredericksburg, VA. Pours to a beautiful, bright, deep chestnut color, with a thick, and creamy off white head, and a soft to moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting ,with lots of good toasty and nutty malt aromas paired with good herbal/grassy hop aroma. The palate is very polished and clean with excellent, deep malty flavors of toast, nuts, light hints of caramel. This beer finishes with more great malty, toasty/nutty flavors, then ends with a nice grassy hop bite that balances the malt sweetness of this beer. So fresh and flavorful from the draught, we drained a keg of this beer in record time. So flavorful yet, so, so drinkiable. This beer is an excellent local example of Oktoberfestbier/marzen that was the perfect match for bratwurst hot of the grill.
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;"Nice deep amber coloured body with ruby highlights and tints of orange. Aroma of malt, a bit of hops and a good amount of mild spices. Medium-bodied; Large malt backbone with a good yeastie and fresh hop flavour going strong. Aftertaste shows some caramel, a bit of coriander seed and a fair amount of floral hops. Overall, a good beer - not amazing, but definitely nice for the style and to try in general. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Whole Foods in Clarendon, Virginia on 18-September-2008, sampled on 26-November-2008."
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;22 oz. bottle from Whole Foods in Richmond, VA. Pours a reddish brown with a thin white head. Grainy taste with caramel and corn notes. Very big taste of butterscotch, breadiness and caramel. Medium bodied.
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;Clear dark amber body with a small off-white head. Sweet malty aroma. Slight hints of fruit punch. Sweet malty flavor with light breadiness and some toastiness.
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;"Courtesy of maniac who dropped by with this and a couple of other ""beers"" for an impromptu tasting. Darmk amber, reddish highlights, slight head. Aroma faintly malty with a slight odd twang of cheddar. Sort of full, slightly burnt malt, but thin at the same time. Better than I’m making it sound, this wasn’t bad. But not great."
Blue & Gray Baron von Steuben Oktoberfest;Fredericksburg, Virginia, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Blue & Gray Brewing Co.;From a 25 oz bottle ... poured with a big poofy head over an amber brew. Light malty aroma. The beer drinks with the smoothness of milk, with a big bready maltiness with a sharp cheesy bitter twist at the end. Quite good.
Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;Pour was a dirty blonde with a large white head. Aroma was nice a fruity with some vanilla and yeast. Flavoir was also above par with a touch of pepper and citrus fruit along with some corriander and spice. Nice example of the style.
Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;Beerfest in Chilton. Fruit aroma, sweet and hops, honey color. Nice start.
Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;"Small pour (approximately 3 oz.), on tap at Gitchee Gumee Brewfest in Superior, WI on 4-5-08. This was the fifth of 12 beers that I rated (out of about 20 total beers that I tried). It was listed as simply ""Muskie Capital Saison"" at the festival. This was my favorite beer of the Brewfest. Pours a clear, dark brass / medium brown, quite dark for a saison. Small amount of beige head. Very nice, Belgian-style, sweet aroma with some dusty dryness. The taste has a very sweet start with a lightly dry finish. Medium body. Crisp, smooth, and lively in the palate. I was highly impressed by this offering and will seek out Muskie Capital if I am ever in its area."
Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;A growler courtesy of Skyview. Cloudy, dark copper color with a large head. Nice farmhouse, banana and yeasty aroma. Big bread, yeast, cloves and malt taste. Excellent.

Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;"Poured from a growler; rustic, cloudy orange appearance. Slightly old bananas in the aroma, with lots of pure cinnamon and clove spiciness; hints of toasted vanilla, almond, and caramel. A generous powdering of nuance settling on a delicately balanced body of calm sweetness; very pleasant. Flavor is flowery and sweet; quite delicate with light tones of pistachio, lavender, white pepper, banana, and ginger. Very creamy, soft, and well arranged in the mouth; balanced and interesting. Finishes with a soft milky sweetness. A fantastic domestic saison. Thanks for sharing, Bob!"
Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;On draught at the brewpub in Hayward, Wisconsin. Pours a clear copper amber amber with a thick, creamy and lumpy off-white head that has some excellent retention and thick lacing. Aroma of clean crystal grain malt, some grassy hops, a touch of banana esters and cloves. Taste is light to medium bodied, some carbonation with flavors of light multi-grain malt, banana esters, a touch of white pepper and herbal spices. Finish is semi-dry, a mild bitterness with some aftertaste of light banana, cloves and cereal grain malt. There was no sediment in this saison but still quite drinkable.
Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;Gold Color with Cream Head. Coriander and Belgian Yeast Aroma. Follows Through on Flavor...Sweet, Yeasty with Spices..Lightly Bready and a Bit Earthy. Very Solid American Saison
Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;Sampled draught at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis, October 7 2006. Dark hazy amber with a smallish but persistent head....nose at first very sweet, herbal (cardamom, ginger) character showing up quickly as the sugary notes die, dry grassy notes start to dominate....body rather tart, earthy, low-to-moderate sweetness, lots of doughy yeastiness in the mouthfeel....finish is borderline sour with some interesting mineral qualities. Not bad.
Muskie Capital Belgian Saison;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Muskie Capital Brewery;One of the highlights of the 2006 Autumn Beer Review. This nanobrewer did this Saison right (and did a much better job than Town Hall’s half-hearted effort a few months ago). The aroma makes this beer immediately recognizable as a saison. There is yeast and barnyard weirdness. More yeast in the flavor, a little sour and some weird spices as well. Touch of citrus and lightly hopped. A cloudy yellow beer, looks like it might not be filtered. -------taste from growler March, 2007. Score raised by 2 points.
Great Waters Pflugenpflagen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Waters Brewing;Autumn Brew Review 2008. Copper color with a thin head. Barley any aroma, just very light grain. The taste seems to be a bit of rye and oatmeal.
Great Waters Pflugenpflagen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Waters Brewing;On-tap the Brewpub: Coppery toned color with a finger high capping of fluffy, firm, light tanned foam. Keeps a good bubbley skim and a solid collar present. Laces in teathered rings around the glass. Aroma is of toasted berries, pale malt, and dried breads. Taste has nice rounded flavors that balance well with a mild berry tone within a semi sweet toffee sweetenss pinched with vanilla and dried fig. The Vienna malt is lightly placed in a sweeter, fresher, bready tone then toasty and finishes with a feathery burntness under the sweet berry malt. Feel is about medium, mildly sweet and snappy with a nice rounded, soft, malty smoothness. Quite drinkable and refreshing. A nice Vienna. The berry fruityness is nicely played along a toffee breaded sweetness.
Great Waters Pflugenpflagen;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Great Waters Brewing;ABR 2006. This is a solid Vienna. Lots of malt. some light hops. Well balanced and a good session beer. Red color.
Mount Tallac Summer Blonde;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mount Tallac Brewing Company;[Tap] Called ’Back Country Blonde’ at Lake Tahoe Pizza Company. I am guessing it is the same beer as the ’Summer Blonde’ based on the ABV and other ratings. Pours a light brown color with a ton of foamy white head. Nice lacing on the glass. Nose is of mild spices, light hops, cereal grains and caramel malts. Distinct malt profile is unlike most blonde ales. Caramel, some toffee, hints of smoke and a decent hop kick. An interesting beer, but a little out of whack for the style.
Mount Tallac Summer Blonde;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mount Tallac Brewing Company;Draft. Amber beer with a cream colored head. Light malt and light spice aroma. malt and spice flavor with light grass. Medium bodied. Malt and spice lingers with light hops.
Mount Tallac Summer Blonde;South Lake Tahoe, California, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mount Tallac Brewing Company;(10/2006. Draft.) Very light malty aromas evident, but by and large very neutral. Ever-so-slightly-hazy golden with a white head that dissipates relatively quickly into a lasting, medium-thick, white film with decent lace. Very smooth flavors. Malty sweetness balanced by a subtle hop spiciness imparted, no doubt, from a noble variety (Hallertau, I’m guessing!). Pleasantly bitter on the back end, medium-bodied with a nice, warming sensation imparted from the relatively high alcohol that remains very tame. Lingering, spicy aftertaste from the hops. Medium-low carbonation.
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Really wish I could remember where and when I had this, but I remember it being such a disappointment that I know I’ve had a few sips. Way too much bourbon with not enough body to back it up. Hints of cherry mucked up by weird sours flavors. A great idea gone weirdly wrong...not to say I’m giving an A for effort to FS for trying something a bit more out of the normal realm!
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Hot boozy nose overwhelming with bourbon and cherries. Would not recommend lighting a match near this beer for fear of the fumes igniting. Slight ethanol-paint thinner-nail polish remover nose. Funky as all hell. The pinot and wood flavors come to life later with each sip. Quite memorable and for this I give it merit, but I would not frequent this beer, even if I could.
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Complex beer, but does suffer a bit from the phenolic nailpolish bite. The aroma is overwhelmed by sharp nail polish smells, but the flavor remains a jungle of flavors. Tart cherry, dry wood, pinot flavors, moldy cheese, and other interesting flavors that make you think. I really enjoyed the sourness and the depth of flavors, it would be very hard to nail them all down. My only problem was the aroma, the flavor was excellent.
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle from J. Harris: Golden color with some bubbles but no head. Aroma is sweet, fruity, woody and wine like. A light body that is swet and fruity at first, then slightly tart and acidic, a little alcohol warmth, you also get a slight bourbon flavor and definitely some pinot noir flavor. A dry wine and wood finish. Very very unique, i gather this is a love it or hate it beer. It is amazingly complex and one of those beers where you can easily pick out 6 different flavors that are all unique. I wouldnt drink a pint of this but very much enjoyed the glass.
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Everyone who tried this at GABF should try and get a hold of another sample. I shared this bottle with John Harris, and while it didn’t affect my perception of the beer I think it gave me a better understanding of what he was shooting for. Once you get past the opening notes of acetone there’s a wonderful funky/sour/tart beer lurking underneath. No head to speak of. Flavors of bourbon and acetone give way to a heady mixture of brett/lacto funk and a vinous finish. Not something I could drink every day, but I’m sure glad I had the chance to taste this abberation :) Thanks again John!
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Rating this one from memory...tasted at GABF. Worst beer that I have ever tried. So bad I had to try it twice to make sure it really was that awful. What’s not to like? How about the taste of gasoline mixed with a bit of paint thinner? No no no no no no no. I’d rather drink non-alcoholic beer.
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;"Draft at Falling Rock. Amber bodied. Nose is very ""unique"". It’s quite liqueur like. Maybe melon liqueur. Very alcoholic nose and over ripened fruits. Taste is sour fruits, oak barrel, alcohol and paint thinner/nail polish. Some malt in there as well. Body is medium with a sour astringency and lots of dry notes. Finishes with more paint thinner, sour fruits and alcohol. I appreciate the attempt, but in the end, I couldn’t finish the glass."
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Draft @ Falling Rock: Dark golden color. It is love it or hate I see. I thought it was pretty tasty. Nice and sour. Vinous notes that was a little odd mixed with bourbon but I didn’t think that was a problem. Grapes, cherries, vanilla and sour. Whats not to like.
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;sampled at GABF 2006. This beer is by far the worst beer I’ve ever tried. I spit it out almost instantly. Besides being extremely combustable it will also peal the paint off your walls. I love Full Sail but this was AWEFUL.
Full Sail Manhattan Project;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Full Sail Brewing Company;Tap @ Falling Rock and again @ GABF. Had to try it again to insure the first one wasn’t just horribly infected. This was by far the worst beer of the 100+ I sampled during the GABF week. I love barrel aged beers, but this was pure finger nail polish remover. Enough said.
Deschutes Phils Trail Pale Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;"""not bad. a little light for my taste, but that is made up for by the incredible freshness of the beer. quite satisfying. it has a lighter hop profile than mirror pond, but equally as good."""
Deschutes Phils Trail Pale Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;"On tap at the Bend brew pub. I found this to have an odd fruit tone along with a dank, musty flavor. It’s clearly a pale ale, but it;s grass and hay instead of citrus and pine. Not even remotely what I expected, and although I have yet to ride Phil’s trails (perhaps this Summer), I would have thought he would expect more. I would not drink this one again and find this sub-par for Deschutes. Nothing more than Mirror Pond, if that."
Deschutes Phils Trail Pale Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;On CASK at Brewpub Pours out amber topped with a small head. A little malt and grass on this one. just so so.

Deschutes Phils Trail Pale Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;Tap @ Brewpub: Gold, nice head and lacing. Nose of husk and funky, musky malts. The flavor is musky, lightly bitter and grassy. The finish is thin, forgetful, light malt. Dry. Not as good as the Painted hills I had right before this one.
Deschutes Phils Trail Pale Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;On Tap at the BrewPub. Oeange amber with a sandy head. Nice balance of rich malts and citrusy hops. Tazte is more bitter hops tham the otjer pale. Nice strong late nitter trail. Nice Pale. Deschutes shows guts having 2 PAs on at the same time.
Deschutes Phils Trail Pale Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;Amber-tangerine orange color w. faded head. Bubble gum and pleasant floral hop bouquet with a moderate sweet malt background. Malty, bubble-gummy flavor with some floral character.
Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale - French Oak;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;Dense orange appearance with short lasting white head. Light fruits and hops with background hops. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale - French Oak;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;this is like the fresh hop version that was bottled, which is already quite nice...then throw in some oak flavor and aroma...pretty dang good!
Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale - French Oak;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;Pretty damn tasty offering from a pretty damn tasty brewery. A bit mjore complexity than the standard mirror pond as well.
Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale - French Oak;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;One of my favorite American Ales. Much better on tap than in a bottle. Just had one last night at a local sports bar after a softball game with a bacon cheeseburger. Nothing could be better! Medium color, I’m guessing 15 SRM. Nice cascade aroma from dry-hopping, yet overall bitterness is subdued. Good head retention, and a nice dry, crisp finish.
Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale - French Oak;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;On tap at the brewpub (and subsequently on growler at home!). Pours an almost clear orange-brown with a medium, cream-colored head like ocean foam. Leaves decent lacing. This is a wonderfully aromatic pale ale, with more than just the usual suspects. To be sure, there’s a healthy amount of lemon-lime citrus and some caramel (not really very pronounced before warming). But these combine in such a way, and undoubtedly with help from the oaking, to convey rose-petal perfumes and a bright fruity character you might find in a dry white wine. The beer is on the light-bodied side with very mild bittering. The body is sweet in a perfumy sort of way and there’s some lemony acidity. Finish is medium in length and light caramel lingers. This is a very nice twist on a pale.
Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale - French Oak;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;On tap at the Deschutes pub. This was really nice, the pale was dried out a lot by the oak. Sweet caramel hint of front blended nicely with the oak and the finish was crisp and very dry from the citrus hops. Pours a clear amber with a tall white head. This beer didn’t stand out much before, but the oak adds a subtle character that makes it much more interesting.
Deschutes Mirror Pond Pale Ale - French Oak;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;Nice light amber, but a soothing cascade hops and honey-suckle aroma. Medium body w.th just enough cascade hops to keep it from being bland. Simple, but crisply hopped beer and a pleasant finish.

Cerveja Super Bock Cool (2006);Balio, Portugal;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Unicer Bebidas (SBG Super Bock Group - Carlsberg);Let me firts make an introduction: this is not the same beer as Super Bock Cool Beer, that existed some 3 years ago. This new product is a weak copy of that beer, launched only for the 2006 Summer. Super Bock Cool Beer was an Ice Beer that demanded special refrigeration and therefore had big distributions costs. So Unicer dropped that particular beer. This year, Sagres, the main rival of Unicer, launched a beer called Sagres Chopp that is intended to please the large brazilian comunity that lives in Portugal. The reply of Unicer was this Super Bock Cool. But this is not an Ice Beer. In fact, it’s a very weak pale lager. With an easy to remove cap, Cool is very pale (straw colour) and has a small white head, mostly diminishing. Not much lively this one!! It has also a strange aroma: very few hops but a strange presence of apple reminding a cider. Flavour has nothing: weak and watery. Nevertheless, this beer can be very refreshing although more bitterness could help. A very bad product and another desillusion from Unicer.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Trois;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;Just called Saison and listed at 6.4% abv. The body was medium gold with a bright white head. The aroma was sweet bubblegum and banana with some cinnamon. The taste was bananas and clove. There was also some hay. Just a big bowl of ok.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Trois;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;"Had one tonight in the mug club vessel, though I heard one server say it is officially served in ""the gay glass""...and here I pour into a pint glass for this assessment. Looks nice, chalk white foam stands tall in the glass, leaving lace, very hazed, pale orange appearance...very nice. Citrus, spice, straw, and a stick of bubblegum mark the nose. Lively and delightful. Again, I find myself liking it. Soft on the palate, then sweet and mellow, revealing slices of lemon and whiffs of orange, with a tangy yeasty kick. Citrus feels sharp later on, with a peppery twist. Lays long, but lightly, on the tongue. Loaded with character, brimming with fine flavor. A very agreeable saison, tasty, well-made, not lacking in any way that I can consider. A must-try treat at the pub right now. Well done!"
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Trois;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;aka Saison Deux Trois. Pours a hazy straw color, topped by a short-lived head of sudsy white foam. A ring provides scant lacing. Wet hay, dog-blanket (as opposed to horse blanket), and lemongrass in the aroma. The malt is sweet and dry at the same time - sweet honeymalt, dry wheat. Lemongrass and a bit of orange behind these. Lighter body, mild carbonation. I don’t think lemongrass is an actual ingredient, but I detect a lemongrass-like flavor and aroma. I am not a fan of lemongrass.
Rock Bottom Minneapolis Saison Trois;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Minneapolis;For three years in a row, Rock Bottom has done a respectable Saison for the Autumn Beer Review. This beer is bitter and spicy, some wheat. Cloudy yellow with a white head. Light barnyard aroma, some yeast, and a little bit sour.

Cloudy straw colour with a huge white head. Yeasty aroma and taste. Dry with a little citrus and bread. Some sourness. Not great.
Spinning Dog Herefordshire Owd Bull;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hereford Brewery;Tasted this at the Crystal Palace, Glasgow (JDW) in September 2008. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale amber in colour with a thin creamy white head. Subtle note of citrus fruit in the short aroma. Thin but zesty mouthfeel. Pale malt complex gives a digestive biscuit base with a grapefruit note evident. Dusty hop resins give a bitter bite to the dry, floral aftertaste. Finish is again slightly bitter with hop resins giving a grapefruit pith note in the palate. An ok session bitter.
Spinning Dog Herefordshire Owd Bull;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hereford Brewery;Cask (JDW, Uxbridge, RBESG2011) Picked onion aroma. Yucky sour sulfurous taste.

A dark amber colour with a few whisps of head. Aroma is dominated by caramel with some hops and malt. Taste is strong caramel with a lot of malt and a little hoppiness.

Chateau Kamiya Ocktoberfest;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);This was called New Years Fest but it seems to be the same. 2007 version. Medium to dark amber color, tall head. Rich malt aroma, slightly nutty, a bit sweet, also a bit buttery. Rich malt flavor. Nutty, bready, a bit sweet. Round and mellow, a bit too buttery, but with good hops as well, better than usual for the style. A little too much carbonation. Almost gassy. Strong, dry, amber malt and hop finish. Lingering bitterness. Very different to a Munich festbier.
Chateau Kamiya Ocktoberfest;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);Cloudy light amber color. Some hops are noticable at first, but as beer warms up bready and caramel notes become more present. Kicks off with a deep bready malty and caramel mouth, but balanced with some hop bitterness in mouth. Very light bodied. Dry bready caramel finish. Beer definetely got better as time went on.
Chateau Kamiya Marzen;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);Tap @ Oedo beer festival, Shinagawa Intercity (as Aki Agari). Pours amber, some white foam on top. Malty nose, light bitterness. Tastes malty, sweetish-malty, linger has some herbs.Overall still mainly sweetish and malty.

Chateau Kamiya Marzen;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);It was odd that they have an Ocktoberfest and a Marzen. The Ocktoberfest was clearly a seasonal, this one I am not so sure. I found this clear deep amber brew was similar to the Ocktoberfest, but better malty flavors and the finish was not so dry. Went excellent with caramelized onions!

Rich malt aroma, biscuity and grainy, with a decent hop character as well. Rather fragrant indeed somewhat sweet and very rich. Rich malt flavor, biscuits, cereals. Round and smooth. Hops are in the background but always evident. Medium or better bitterness. Moderate sweetness. A nice, rich lager in the Helles style, but with a much stronger hop character—I guess a Dortmunder Export type. Very interesting and pleasant. Good hop bitterness, and a great hoppy finish. Probably their best beer I have had so far.
Chateau Kamiya Braumeister;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);Sampled @ GJBF Yokohama: Gold, yellow, light white head, nice lacing. Nose of light fruit and yeast, light malt and a balanced nutty finish. Decent.
Chateau Kamiya Braumeister;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);@ GJBF 2007. Golden color. Tosted malts, some fruit, and hops. Flavor is just and extension of the mediocre aroma. It’s not a bad brew, but just sorta there.
Chateau Kamiya Braumeister;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);Deep golden color. Toasted barely nose. Soft fruity nose of bananas and peaches, which was a bit odd I thought. Soft mouthfeel, slightly winey with bananas and toasted malt and a nice toasted malt finish. I think it was aiming for a Dort, but it seem to have some odd, though not unpleasent, other characteristics.

Red Rock Red Rock;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Red Rock Brewery (UK);"[31/3/13, 500ml bottle rebadged for National Trust ""A La Ronde Best"" that my Dad shared with me - cheers!] A slightly hazy effervescent amber bitter with a large cream head. Good mouthfeel - a bottle conditioned ale that actually achieves the mouthfeel of cask ale. Orange and lots of bread yeast up front, with some herbs. Rather astringent in the finish, with a spicy, earthy bitterness afterwards. I liked it initially but swiftly went off it and struggled to finish it. 7/3/4/4/9. [Re-rate, 1/8/14, cask at the Cherub Inn, Dartmouth rebadged as ""Tolchards Devon Coast""> Stupid, stupid cheating fecky rebadges. Though this was a new brewery. Bastards. It’s not even like it was a decent beer that I particularly wanted to re-rate. This time it’s dull amber with a thin white head. Very bland - just a slight floral and citrus hint as if someone wavd a hop pellet vaguely in the brewery once upon a time. That said, there’s no off notes, and the beer has a reasonable enough body and is quite thirst quenching; it’s just completely dull, as if a competent brewer was asked to make a beer on such a low budget that he couldn’t afford enough hops. 5/3/5/3/10"

Aroma is wheat, bananas, bit of white pepper and some creamy sweetness. Taste is not as full-on as some weizens, but still has banana sweetness, more creaminess than in the aroma, just a touch of bitterness, and bready malt. Small prickle in mouth. Very nice solid weizen.
Chateau Kamiya Weizen;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);Draught at the Brewery. Deep darkish gold, cloudy, with orange tints and lots of bubbles. Aroma of crackers, cookies, banana and citrus, cloves. Relatively fruity, with good citrus. Sweet and creamy, with lots of banana and wheat malt and a good sour tang. Too much carbonation, though--prickly, actually. Also way too cold. Nice taste overall, with good balance, but too gassy.
Chateau Kamiya Weizen;Ushiku-shi, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Chateau Kamiya (Ushiku Beer);Hazy golden color. Fragerant banana bubblegum nose. Clovey, banana loaded mouth.

A sweet souirish aroma showing beginning of infection, phenolic. In mouth, a big sweet malt with some nutty notes, but very harsh and astringent, with loads of tannins. This one went in the bushes. On tap at brewery, Oct. 8, 2006.
Brewer's Art 10th Anniversary Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Brewer's Art;Kennett 06. Pours a cloudy golden body with a fluffy almost pure white head and some nice lacing. Spicy peppery yeast aromas- which seem like they are becoming a trend in thier beers- almsot like a house belgian character- slightly citrus with a bit of lemon essence. Hay, grain and spice in the flavor, light pils malts, some other spicy notes like cinnamon, and some other yeasty phenols like clove. Pretty good and smooth mouthfeel. Nice overall belgian ale.
Brewer's Art 10th Anniversary Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Brewer's Art;Draught samples at Kennett Fest on 10/7/06 Lovely, soft, hay-yellow body shows medium-low clarity and boasts an immaculate white head, dense and creamy with very high retention, modest lacing. Reminds me almost exactly of Unibroue 10’s appearance, though more hazy than that one. Lemongrass, saffron, coriander, white pepper and very modest ginger are all things that come to mind, not sure which one(s) of those are actually in there. But it’s done with delightful moderation, allowing very dry honey and baked white biscuits to emerge, providing a strong balance to the spices. Dry, creamy wheat seems apparent, giving that smooth, nutty, almost vanilla-like note. Yeast apparency is not heavy, but it is noticeably Belgian, contributing light pears, peaches and a hint of clove. No alcohol noted in the aroma and a medium strength to it overall. Spicy flower petals, muted ginger and fresh, somewhat acidic herbal notes dot the palate, upon the first sip. Light baguette-like malt notes creep in slowly, but are kept minimized by a brisk carbonation. Snappy finish shows light fruit esters (more peach/nectarine and some light apple) and plenty of coriander and white pepper-like dryness. Great level of attenuation, possibly even too dry for my tastes, so that’s saying a lot. Honey atop biscuits is about the extent of the malt. Just a dry, sort of grainy/biscuity flavor and texture with moderate touches of sweetness. Spices linger on, but the usual spice astringency in beers like this does not seem to build up. No alcohol apparent. Very clean and refreshing. No wateriness or alcohol noted. VERY drinkable for its size. Toning down the carbonation a touch and maybe even stepping back on the spices, while getting a little more succulent honey notes from pils malt would be my reccomendations.
Brewer's Art 10th Anniversary Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Brewer's Art;Wonderful mix of friuty and piney spiciness. A bit of an alcohol kick, but normal for the type. Fruity upfront, tasty all the way.
Brewer's Art 10th Anniversary Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Brewer's Art;"KSBF 2006. Pours a hazy golden amber with a large foamy off white head. Aroma of Belgian spices, yeast, pilsner malt, bready and some ""holiday"" spices. Flavor was spicy, cinnamon, bready and more of the holiday spices along with some citrus and pine from the hops."
Brewer's Art 10th Anniversary Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Brewer's Art;On tap at KSBF ’06... Appears a hazy gold with a small off-white head that slowly fades away. Spots of lacing are left around the glass. The smell is of cinnamon, coriander, saffron, cardamom, and a spicy apple and citrus aroma that feeds off the doughy, Belgian yeast. Taste is of the given aromas with a nod to the Belgian yeast, which sets the style up for being a spiced Belgian Ale. Mouthfeel is smooth with gentle spicing flicking the tongue during the swallow.
Brewer's Art 10th Anniversary Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;The Brewer's Art;On tap at the KSBF ’06. Poured a deeper orange / amber color with large sized off white head. Fruity aroma (apples) with spices and some citrus. Tastes of spices, fruity and citric.
Legacy Bourbon Barrel Hedonism Red;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - American;Legacy Brewing Co.;Kennett 06. Pours a hazy bright orange with a thin diminishing head. Straigh up sharp and hot bourbon aroma and sweet sticky caramel malts- pretty hot though. Sweet sharp malt flavor with lgith vanilla and solventy esters, somewhat fruity and dominated again by a hot bourbon burn in the end. Citrusy hops in the flavor as well and the bitterness competes with the alcohol burn. Too much bourbon.
Legacy Bourbon Barrel Hedonism Red;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - American;Legacy Brewing Co.;Flat pour, roused up a small offwhite head that faded quickly. Fairly hazy amber hued brew. Nose of whisky and wood, faint citrus notes if huffed hard. Thin bodied, flat, sorta watery. Thin oak and whisky flavors, grainy malts, hops? A hint malty. Finish is dry, thin and fast.
Legacy Bourbon Barrel Hedonism Red;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - American;Legacy Brewing Co.;KSBF 2006. Pours a lightly hazy brownish amber with a small bubbly off white head. Aroma of light bourbon, hops some caramel malts. Flavor of caramel, vanilla, light bourbon and more of the hops. Very toned down compared to the regular version. Not sure I liked what the bourbon aging did to this one.
Legacy Bourbon Barrel Hedonism Red;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - American;Legacy Brewing Co.;On tap at KSBF ’06... Appears a hazy brown, caramelized, cola color with a small, soapy, off-white head that slowly fades out. Little spots of lacing are left around the glass. Smell is of bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, and subdued hops. Taste is of the aromas with a bit of a bitey harshness that’s either from the oak tannins, or the residual hoppiness that is trying to crawl through the bourbon oak aging. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, bitter, with oaky wood lingering in the swallow. Overall, not a bad experiment.
Legacy Bourbon Barrel Hedonism Red;Reading, Pennsylvania, United States;Strong Ale - American;Legacy Brewing Co.;On tap at the KSBF ’06 [Cask]. Poured a deep amber color with small sized off white head. Aromas of wood, vanilla, light bourbon and a trace of citrus. Tastes of stronger bourbon, wood, and citrus. The bourbon tastes were too strong and overpowered the other tastes. I’m usually a fan of BA beers, but the bourbon tastes (and I like bourbon) really didn’t add anything - actually took away from the hoppiness I liked in the regular Hedonism.
Braumanufaktur Honig;Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Braumanufaktur Forsthaus Templin;Draught: Poured a orange brown with an off white creamy head. The aroma is sweet honey. The taste follows that up with a nice sweet malt and honey. Very interesting beer on a hot weekend.

Braumanufaktur Honig;Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany;Flavored - Other;Braumanufaktur Forsthaus Templin;Draught. Cloudy red/bown colour. Nice, creamy, stable light brown head. Quite sweet, very sweet flavour. Also malty and a bit roasted. The sweetness seems to come from malt sugars rather than the honey. OK, but I could not drink much of this.
Baird Holiday Joy Spiced Beer;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Flavored - Other;Baird Brewing Co.;This is for the 2004 batch. He makes this is a similar context to OSA. Dark amber color, nutmeg, cloves, cardamon and cinammon in the nose. Full mouth, creamy. Reminds me of apple pie. Smooth sweet malty finish with a caramel, nutmeg and cinnamon after taste. Drank in August 06. Aged very nice.
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;750 ml corked and caged bottle poured a clear reddish brown with a lingering ring of tan bubbles. Aromas of cherries, barnyard, oak, plum and raisins. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a dry tart finish. Flavors of cherry, grape, oak, barnyard and light carmel with a crisp dry tart lingering fruity finish.
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;750 bomber - thanks to Ratman for this. Pours a clear wine-reddish color with very little head or lacing into a New Belgium globe. Aromas of zinfandel and oak, with hints of cherries and zest. Flavor was more tart than expected for a Heller bock, with a sweet,funky palate and a sour cherry fruitiness.. Finished with a tart, vinous note. Quite the crackerjacks box.
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;Bottle shared with Doodler and Ratman. Awesome choice Don! Cloudy dark red brown appearance with no head. Tart, red fruity, Bretty, vinous nose. Tart, acidic, Bretty, horseblanket, red fruity flavor. Tart, red fruity, sour, oaky, Bretty aftertaste. Nice beer but shows no characteristics of a Heller Bock. I probably rate this higher for a sour ale style.
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;Pours copper with a thin tan head. Smells of caramel, fruity, some floreal hints. Tastes oaky and dry with a lot of sweetness. Barrel aging did not do this beer justice.
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;Bottle shared by MIBRomeo on 12/16/06: Pours a hazy copper mahogany with a thin ring of tan bubbles. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, light oak, and tart fruity cherries. Body has a nice balance of sweet caramel malt and tart fruity notes. An interesting and enjoyable brew.
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;Bottle. Pours a hazy copper with a ring of white foam. Malty lemon aroma with some brett. Medium body and carbonation. The taste has some wood, tea, nuts, apricot. I pick up a bit of oak in the finish.
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;Hazed dark copper color with only a few bubbles adrift atop. Light oak and pale malts filter through the nose. Hint of sourdough in the backdrop along with some mild fruits. Smooth and full in feel. Flavors of Door County cherries, with a linger of sourmash. I like it.
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;"750ml thanks to MIBRomeo and ""Magic Fridge 2006"". Hazed vitamin B12 goodness having the sediment end of this rare treat. Much lighter brett character when compared to the Extra Special Gonzo. I’m not getting much of the heller bock aspect at all as the brett is still stealing the show. Light malts evident, 2-row coming through just barely. A little hint of oak and smoked character to round out the palate, but the wild yeast is definately the show in this one although not as well done as with its brother."
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;Bottled at the Magic Porch... thanks to MIBRomeo for scoring this brew! Poured a lightly hazy reddish/iced tea brown with only a few loose bubbles around the edges. Nose was of tart cherry and dust funkiness with underlying smoky caramel, toffee, and a hint of lemon... odd concept for a beer, but worked very well. Flavor was heavily laced with funky brett fruitiness.. really liked how it complimented the sweet toffee and smoked wood beneath. Sour on the palate with a light and somewhat grainy body.. felt good. This was a very unique beer that I am glad to have tried! Thanks Chuck!
Flying Dog Extra Special Heller Hound;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Flying Dog Brewery;Hazed and caramel-amber in color with only a few dust speckles on the surface. Pencil erasures, almond shell shavings, muskrit, cumin and maple sourdough take the nose for a ride. Apple candied toffee, sandalwood and dried cider vinegar discourage the tastebuds early on. Sweet granny smith apples are ripe from the picking, imparting a near citric-shine on the brittle bark. Brown sugar gets liquefied with some tart, accentuated oxidation. Barely a body, and no carbonation, leaving no room for the soured caramel and golden raisins to hide. Dry, waxy tongue and apple butter jam the exits. Thanks for sharing, Chuck!

Legend Beer Weizen;Hanoi, Vietnam;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Legend Beer;Draught at Legends, HoanKiem location. Cloudy golden, creamy head. Fruity phenolic nose. Rather sweet and light bodied. Wheat malt and phenols are evident, esters are nor. A bit mushy but still refreshing. A reasonable weizen, and the only one I could find in Hanoi.
Legend Beer Weizen;Hanoi, Vietnam;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Legend Beer;Draught at Legends Beer restaurant. My general thinking that pretty much any wheat beer will usually be at least ok appears to hold up even in Vietnam. Pours a darkish orange with a nice looking foamy head that disappears quickly. Tastes of orange peel and wheat. Flavour is fairly rich and satisfying, but does suffer a tad from a slightly garbagey finish.
Ikiiki Brown Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Brown Ale;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;Sweet malty toffee, caramel, butterscoth nose. Very rich. Malty mouth with lots of butterscotch flavors, but not as full bodied as I would like and a disappointly dry finish.
Hidatakayama Dark Ale;Takayama-shi, Gifu-ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Hida Takayama Beer;5% can in Takayama. Lovely looking amber-bronze with a light beige finger of foam. Very nutty aroma, caramel and raspberry. Toasted grain malt flavour, nut and berry flourishes. Sherbet-type fizziness with a bit of chew to the body and plenty of bitterness to finish. A bit underrated on here, I thought this was a great English ale.

Hidatakayama Dark Ale;Takayama-shi, Gifu-ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Hida Takayama Beer;Half in Good Beer Faucets, Shibuya. For a dark ale it’s surprisingly clear light and reddish coloured with a medium white foam head. Nose is touch fruity ale-ish. Taste is fruity like an ale but with a bit of raspberry and strawberry sweetness. Crisp and with a dryish lager like hop bite.
Hidatakayama Dark Ale;Takayama-shi, Gifu-ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Hida Takayama Beer;Draft (at Bagpipe Cafe in Takayama). A chestnut brown with a large frothy head. A fruity, caramel nose. Quite a light palate, but toffee and orange softly mingle in the mouth.

Hidatakayama Dark Ale;Takayama-shi, Gifu-ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Hida Takayama Beer;"Bottle from Yamaoka in Kyoto. This beer is 5%, and so really is not so much an English Strong Ale as an English brown ale, I would say. Rich dark malt aroma, with caramel, nuts, grains, and detactable but light hops. Medium reddish/amber color, a bit too light for the name “dark ale,"" but attractive nonetheless. Very thin head that went straight to lace. Rich, malt-centered flavor, nutty, with lots of cereal malts, caramel, a touch of chocolate, and a slightly roasted flavor. Quite complex. A bit of dark fruit, with a slight citrus touch. Lightly hops, but they come in near the end to provide a rather bitter finish. Well balanced and tasty. Good stuff."
Hidatakayama Dark Ale;Takayama-shi, Gifu-ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Hida Takayama Beer;Bottle. Clear amber with a small head. Caramel aroma. Well-balanced caramel flavours and hoppy flavours, as well as some toffee. Decent, but not overexciting.

Perfect balance, light but flavorful smoking, rich,, sweet, and cakey yet never cloying. Perfectly rich, smooth mouth. Best Japanese wheat beer to date? 2008 ""Mori no Weizen"" Oktoberfest, a weizen rauch. Bottle from Yamaoka in Kyoto. 8/4/8/4/16. Very cloudy medium brown color with orange—almost a dunkel. Enormous, frothy head that lasts forever. Aroma of wheat malt, bananas, spices, smoke. Rich, somewhat sweet but balanced by the lightish smoke. Nose is subtle but very appealing. Light smoke in the flavor balances the wheat malt very well. The wheat, banana, and spice still come through rich and strong, but less sweet and cakelike than their regular weizen. Very well balanced, with the smoke lasting through to the finish and longer. Very nicely done."

Bia Festival;Hue City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Hue Brewery (Carlsberg);Another Central-Vietnamese beer this time served on tap. This particular offering is brewed with malt instead of rice. What I would term as being a ‘light’ beer with a rather grainy element but a rather sharp, sour, synthetic, citrus flavoured after taste. Slightly oily texture when swallowing. Not as bad as some of the cheaper Vietnamese beers, but certainly not on the same par as Huda.

Marzoni's Smoked Porter;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Smoked;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Bottle via Bill. The beer pours to a dark brown body with ruby highlights. A nice light brown/tan head sits on top with spotty lacing. The aroma is lightly charred malt and smoke. Reminds me of a Scotch or Scottish ale. Chocolate. The flavor is smoky chocolate and also Scottish like. The palate is sweet, moderately bodied, and nicely textured.
Marzoni's Smoked Porter;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Smoked;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Dark opaque pour w/ a nice tan head and some decent lacing.

Marzoni's Smoked Porter;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Smoked;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Dark reddish brown body, normal-looking light tan head. Lightly smoked sweet malt aroma. Not overly sweet, but it is more of a generic sweetness. Peppery chipotle-like smoke on a roasty (maybe that’s the chipotle) malt body. Smokey chocolate towards the finish. Okay, well-rounded beer.

Mild fruity hops with a nice sweet hint of chocolate and cafe creme. Dark black brown clear with a thin creamy off-white head. Medium-heavy watery body with medium carbonation. Starts sweet with caramel and sugary sweetness. Big smoky taste from start to finish. Chocolate and a bit of fizziness leads to a carbonic tang. A bit watery but finishes with a nice nutty bitterness and a dry roasted grainy after. A bit sweeter than other porters, but the smokiness helps smooth it out to a drier finish that is fairly clean.

Marzoni's Smoked Porter;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Smoked;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;On tap at KSBF ’06... Appears black with brown edges and a small, light beige head that slowly fades out. Spots of lacing are left behind. Smell is chocolatey, with malt balls, roasty grain, creamy with just a touch of smoke. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a chocolate malt presence that tastes enjoyable but not quite as enticing as the aromas. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with hints of the roasty, baker’s chocolate coming through in the form of bitterness. The finish was slightly thin but not terrible considering the amount of bitters that are trying to engulf this beer. The smoke was just an afterthought but it wasn’t bad with all things aside.

Bivina;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Vietnam Brewery Company;Poured from a 330 ml can. Aroma is malt forward with grain, white bread and hints of adjuncts. Faint hop notes and esters with no phenolics. Pours a very clear, pale, yellow gold with a medium large, pillowy,white head that exhibits decent retention as it recedes to a thin film that lingers for a bit. Light lacing and no legs. Flavor is slightly sweet with light grain notes and hints of adjuncts. Light floral esters and hop notes with faint grassy note. Low bitterness and no phenolics. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, this is a very bland beer. Malt profile is very light and everything else is even lighter.

Bivina;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Vietnam Brewery Company;I drank this one on my vacation in Hoi An. To keep it simple - it was disgusting. The beer’s color was a very bright yellow - it looks like apple juice mixed with very poor carbonated water. And it tasted nearly the same. The grain, the hops, the malt - everything was close to be tasteless. The only good thing about this is that the aftertaste won’t last too long. Bottle 450ml
Bivina;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Vietnam Brewery Company;"bottle, in hoi an. very pale shade of yellow with a disinterested head; aroma of raw grain and industrial cleaning products; no bitterness or flavour whatsoever"
Bivina;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Vietnam Brewery Company;Not a good Vietnamese, they kind of know how to make Pales and this one is a little bit disappointing...
Bivina;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Vietnam Brewery Company;Bottle in Nha Trang, Vietnam. Very typical asian lager. Pale golden color with white head that dissipates. However, nice lacing on the glass. Straw/grassy, not much else. Nothing exciting.
Bivina;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Vietnam Brewery Company;Hoi An area of Southern Vietnam is an area that lacks decent beers. Bivina is an alternative to Beer Saigon, a poor alternative. The pale colour gives an indication that the alcohol content is weak, the taste is poor by International standards. At least they have ISO 9001 Quality Standards, to ensure every bottle is equally bad no doubt.
Bivina;Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Vietnam Brewery Company;Bottle (450 ml) in Hoi An. Clear yellow - white head. Fresh, light hoppy, straw, light light malty, corn, light grains, eggs.... you know the rest.

Pepperwood Pumpkin Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;2008-10-04. Lightly hazy orange body with a small off-white head. Modest aroma, light spice - nutmeg, cinnamon? Flavour is mild with prominent spice up front - nutmeg and cinnamon again - Light bitterness in the finish, touch of pumpkin is mild really. Pretty solid, rather nice as is but I would like a little more oomph all around for my tastes a la ST Pumking. On tap at the brewpub
Pepperwood Pumpkin Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Slightly spicy, caramelly, pumpkiny aroma. Cloudy amber colour is slightly orangey. Big, fleshy pumpkin, caramel taste with lots of hoppy dryness. Perhaps a touch of lacquer-like phenol in the finish, which is troubling. Sorry Paul - my trip to Pepperwood was a spur of the moment thing!
Pepperwood Pumpkin Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Hazy orange, a roasted pumpkin/yam color with thick white head. Phenols and some rotting vegetables unfortunately mar the aromas. Good carbonation level. The flavors are garbled and vegetal with no pumpkin pie spices. Seems to be well-hopped and good but sadly suffers from some problems.
Pepperwood Pumpkin Ale;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Pepperwood Bistro Brewery;Pint at Pepperwoods Oct 9/06 with S.B. Pours a nice orange colour with very little head to be seen, somewhat disappointing. The nose is of pumpkins, cloves, cinammon, and malt. Taste consisting of much the same, a very complex beer. Palate is of malt and cloves. This is like mixing grandma’s pumpkin pie with beer.. Very interesting and delicious.
Shed Kriekfest;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Lambic - Fruited;The Shed Restaurant & Brewery;Surprising selection for a small brew-pub, this was nice. It poured a clear red/maroon color, with sour cherry, malt, and spice in the aroma and flavor. Nicely balanced: quite good.

Deep clear and refractive deep gold with a decent off-white head. Catty and dry aroma, light alcohol with a bit of tart fruit (8-). Taste follows - light but catty, hint of green pepper and mid-level alpha acidity, masks the alcohol quite well. Slick, still, average body, medium-long catty tingly dry non-coating finish, nice dry pungency in the aftertaste - very good.
Salopian Hop Twister;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salopian Brewery;Handpull cask at the Salmon, Leicester. Golden and cleat with a small uneven white head. Pear drops, apple juice, resin in the aroma. Sweet juicy taste with a biscuity sweet note giving a gentle balance. A simple little pale ale but a joy to drink.

Steel River Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Sweet floral hop malt aroma. Clear amber colour with fair head and lacing. Malt hoppy flavour with fruit and flowers. Fizzy palate.
Steel River Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;A pleasant suprise. Wasn’t expecting much with the dodgy labelling but inside was a well made well balanced beer. Again alot of citrus and floral aromas. A good Newcastle alternative to the less good Blue Tongue.
Steel River Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Golden yellow with lots of medium sized bubbles buzzing around. A fruit salad aroma that provided a different bouquet to your usual pale lager. The flavour was mostly balanced, but with some unfortunate metallic bitterness creeping in at the finish. The thin body was a little weak to contain the alcohol, which is a surprise given that it is only 4.4%. Worth a re-rate from the bottle, but I won’t be rushing out for it.
Steel River Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Conditions often play a big part in the raing of a beer even though they shouldn’t. I had this last Saturday when the mercury was neaqrly tipping the old cenntury fahrenheit mark. It has all the hallmarks of your typical pale lager in that it is fairly unexiting, but one can’t fault the quality. Standard lager look but no adjuncty cereal nose to speak of. Clean, reasonably balanced and refreshing, mind you that wasn’t hard given the conditions on the day.
Steel River Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;This new brewery in Newcastle, NSW, has made the unusual move of launching with two lagers. This, the second of the two, is pitched as an everyday quencher in the hope of wooing a few macro drinkers away from the likes of VB and Tooheys New. A bottled version is creeping into Sydney bottlos (the Australian Hotel in The Rocks had it in October). The draught version sampled at the recent Australian Hotel beer festival and rated here was fresh and really rather good. No fireworks but it seemed a nice, fruity lager - very clean and without obvious flaws. Standard lager appearance with a skinny corona. Light and fruity aroma - canned pineapple, lychee and dustry hops. Very promising. Standard palate, quite soft. Good malt flavours, perhaps a bit papery, with some lime notes. Sourish quenching finish with some lingering bitterness. A very fair everyday drinker.

Mid gold with a disappearing off-white head and gentle carbonation. Aged red apples and a gentle hint of lime on the nose. Off-dry in the mouth with a pith lime note and short roasty wood finish.

Red Rock Back Beach;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);500ml bottle [Special thanks to Grumbo for filling the last English county gap]. Minimally cloudy, yellow-ish golden colour with average to huge, frothy, slowly osteoporosing, minimally lacing, white head. Floral, grassy, minimally fruity, hoppy and minimally strawy and biscuity, pale malty aroma, a touch of rhubarb and gooseberry.

Red Rock Back Beach;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);Bottle from Sidmouth Wines, Sidmouth. Golden-amber with an extremely thin head. Quite fizzy and active in the palate, it’s a fruity ale in the main, with some toffee also available in its nose. It’s perhaps a little thin in its taste, but crisp, with a light easy-supping nature.v

Red Rock Back Beach;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);March 2010: This bottled conditioned 500ml of beer was consummed 3 months before its BBD. Poured into a vase shaped pint glass. A haze took the shine of this pale amber/orange coloured ale, on top sat a pure white head, deep initially, losing depth at a steady rate. Not sure if I poured in any sediment, or the beer is supposed to have a haze? Hops provided the most smell coming from the glass, flowery, grassy and with a hint of citrus fruits. The taste more or less followed the smells, with an extra tangy feel, an almost ginger style hotness too. The alcohol at only 3.8% ABV doesn’t sound interesting to some BA’s, but this is a well produced, balanced British Bitter and well worth trying.
Red Rock Back Beach;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);Pale in colour with a slight haze after pouring. Aromas slightly fruity - pears, yeast and hay along with the usual malt and citrussy hops. In taste this was reasonably bitter but a bit thin on flavour and lacking in body. A nice enough thirst quencher though.
Red Rock Back Beach;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);No noise once the cap comes off and it appears still in the glass. A radiant light orange in colour, almost bright and headless bar a ring of white on the meniscus. Nose is predominately lemon peel, bitter orange and white Semillon grapes with just a touch of yeast and pine nuts. In the mouth it is quite weedy, lots of pine, nettles and gritty, dusty grain, straw and toothpick. Very dry. Long, long dry, gritty pine wood and dried bitter herbs swallow. Drew out and absorbed all the saliva in my mouth. Light body, very light, and almost still in feel with just a tease of carbonation up front. Lacks balance and is a bit messy flavour wise. Drinkable but not sessionable as it left me parched! (50cL, BBE 08/12, Greendale Farm Shop, Woodbury Common, Exeter, Devon)
Red Rock Back Beach;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);"50cl bottle from Moor & More Beer, Plymouth.

Red Rock Back Beach;Teignmouth, Devon, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Red Rock Brewery (UK);Cask, gravity at Luton BF ’10. Pale gold with a small white head. Curious burnt match aroma, maybe with a hint of vinegar. Or tomato ketchup. Or popcorn. Taste was rather nasty, suggestive of corn or rice. Or Snickers bar. Slight bitterness. Didn’t work, I regret to say.
Windie Goat Priest's Wheel;Mauchline, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Windie Goat Brewery;Had this excellent local Scottish ale at the Troon Beer Festival October 2006. Cask, handpump dispense. Dark copper red in colour with a tight white creamy head. Floral hop aroma with a good silky mouthfeel. Complex dark malts in taste giving a very fruity flavour of juicy summer berries and an unusual delicate bouquet of parma violet sweets! Refreshing fruit notes linger on with a slight dryness from the aromatic hop finish. A cracking summer session ale for those fed up with drinking Deuchars IPA cloned citrus types.
Windie Goat Priest's Wheel;Mauchline, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Windie Goat Brewery;Cask at Smithfield Hotel, Manchester. A hazy amber beer with a lazing beige head.

Five Star Wheat;Beijing, China;Wheat Ale;Beijing Five Star Tsingtao Brewing Co.;Canned. Pale golden, clear, no head. No aroma. Very light bodied with thin but rounded mouthfeel. Possible there’s a very light hint of wheat malt. No bitterness. I’m glad that Carrefour in Beijing offered an English translation of the name on their shelves, as otherwise there’d been no way I’d been able to know that this was indeed a wheat beer.
Caledonian Full Monty;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Sampled this in the Saltcot, Saltcoats (JDW) in October 2006. Pale straw in colour with a slight touch of palest amber. Fragrant dry hopped aroma. Very thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Typical Caley biscuit malt in the mouth but lacking in complexity and body. No fruit notes but hop resins give a dry hop bite in the aftertaste. Finish is dry with citric notes present. Overall poor considering the ABV, give this one a miss.
Caledonian Full Monty;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask (handump), Penderels Oak (JDW), Holborn, London, October 2006. Golden colour, with a lasting white head. Lively condition, but not too fizzy. Scant aroma, but it was a bit cold. Modest citric notes in the flavour but not a huge amount there really. Dry, clean finish. Nor unpleasant but I would expect a bit more depth from a 4.7% beer.
Caledonian Full Monty;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Clear golden body. Completely missing head. Light floral hoppy to the nose. Golden beer with mix of citrus and malts. Shades of butter, but otherwise alright with a vague bitterness in the ending. Right beer for an indian summer in late September (Half on gravity at The St Albans Beer Festival 27.09.2006).
Caledonian Full Monty;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);cask at the Maltings, York: Aroma is of floral hops and pale malt. The beer came off the tap with a small white cask head and had a golden transulcent body. Nicely balanced taste, that was heavier on malt, but went more into floral hops in the finish. better than average bitter.
Caledonian Full Monty;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Pale golden colour with a small white head. Malty and caramel sweet aroma with a light hoppy note. Malty, sweet flavor with a vague hoppy finish.

Pale golden colour with a somewhat coarse off-white head. Nice soft shortbread-like malt-aroma. Smooth malty flavour with some citrus fruity hops. Somewhat boring after a while.
Caledonian Full Monty;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask@The Market Porter, Borough, London. The name of this beer refers to Colin Montgomerie, the Scottish golfer and i’m guessing it was a special for the Ryder Cup golf. This was sweet and buttery (diacetyl!) and caramelly. Lots of butterscotch. I’m not sure if it was the condition at the pub or the beer is meant to taste like this.
Hapi Jing Gian Wang;Harbin, China;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Harbin Beer Company (AB InBev);Canned. Lightly hazy pale yellow, average head. Prune aroma. Sweet, fruity and light bodied with some paper. No bitterness. A fairly solid lager by Chinese standards.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);March 2010. From bottle. Pale yellow color with a white head. Aromas of malt, yeast and hops. Crisp and clean with a refreshing finish.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);From Albertsons in Clarkston, WA. Poured pale yellow with almost no head. Nose of grass. :Light body. Fizzy mouthfeel. Flavor is European Lager. Reminds me of Heineken.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Clear yellow with a white head. Hat aroma. Taste is sweet malts with some lights hops.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Hay, grass, mint, and skunk aroma, very green. Clear yellow, no head. Light malt, lemon prominent at midpalate but present throughout. Not real strong, but tasty. Good for what it is, better than Heineken.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);A quirky one. It is almost pilsener-like. It is a surprisingly tasty EPL if you get it fresh and unskunked.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Clearly a Heineken rip-off, which shouldn’t be too hard to screw up, but this one really isn’t too good. Luckily you will drink it fast, without thinking about it too much.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);12 oz. bottle- Pours golden with a better than expected head, decent lacing, aroma is a little skunky, but not bad. The flavor is what I expected, Heineken. Average, average, average.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);"12 oz bottle. Aroma is not like Heineken, which I was expecting. I was expecting a skunk beer and ended up with a decent smelling Euro lager. This is just the aroma, mind you. Appearnce is as a standard Euro lager--pale gold, little head, average lacing. Tastes like straw, cheap adjuncts; no skunk, surpsringly, given the green bottle. Better than I was expecting, but definitely not great."
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Wow, this is a really interesting beer that flies under the radar. It is a spartan brew, and can best be described as cold, clean, and direct. Very smooth and very clean is the beginning. And the finish is the same-- remarkably smooth and clean. The middle is surprisingly complex and unexpected, given how the beer begins. Yes, this brew might be in the same category as Heineken, but it is much smoother and fresher and of higher quality than that middle of the road beer. Straight from the fridge, this beer is very satisfying and almost intriguing.
Gouden Haven;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);***review from June 21, 2008*** Another crap beer from the wonderful Beers Around the World mishap. Poured out a crystal clear medium hued solid gold brew, a small white cap, thin ropy lacing and retention just above a skim. The aromas was very dry and quite interesting somehow. Sort of sweet, a large grain content, plastic? and an odd underlying smell. The taste is less than appealing as it is very harsh and very watery with bad hops and a bit of metal. Comes across empty with a weak flavor similar to a light beer. Gassy and foamy too. Slight malt can be found in the aftertaste, which is unsavory. Why bother even finishing this?
Gilded Otter Hefeweizen;New Paltz, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Tap at the source. Pours mildly unfiltered but very very pale yellow. White head. Aroma is banana city, some clove, wheat, touch of lemon. One sided. Flavor is banana, lemon, wheat. Ehh. Underwhelming. Too much of a banana note.

Gilded Otter Hefeweizen;New Paltz, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Draft. Pours hazy yellow orange with a thin white head. Fruity and yeast, with banana, lemon, cloves, and light floral notes. Good stuff.

Very drinkable in the summer heat.
Gilded Otter Hefeweizen;New Paltz, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;I’m not a big Hefeweizen drinker but this one is pretty good. The banana aftertaste is both barely noticable and somehow extremely pleasant. Give this a try for sure.
Gilded Otter Hefeweizen;New Paltz, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;In short: A watery lemonade with some rotting bananas. Yep, that good. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Cloudy pale yellow body topped by a very small white head In long: Nose has the basic lemon and banana notes that I expect from an entry-level brewpub hefe. It goes downward from here. The body is very watery. The wheat is elusive. This like a lemonade with rotting bananas in the after-taste. This is less than bland, this is a bit offensive. It irritates me a lot when I am served a shitty beer in a brewpub. Plus I never know how much I should tip a waiter I just threw my pint at.
Gilded Otter Hefeweizen;New Paltz, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Yellow though marketed as unfiltered. No head. A story in bannana. Not as a mastery of yeast, rather as a chick fruit drink with bannana syrup from a can thrown in. That’s how it tasted. Not so drinkable like that, but I can see patrons liking it so.Sticky aroma and mouthfeel.
Gilded Otter Hefeweizen;New Paltz, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;tap: thought this was a great hefeweizen. arouma is banana, trail mix (dried fruit, yogurt covered nuts, apricots) cloves, touch of cinnamon. Hazy yellow pour. smooth tasty with just a touch of bitter hops.
Gilded Otter Hefeweizen;New Paltz, New York, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Gilded Otter Brewing Company;"Pint at the restaurant, the drink menu states that they use the Weihenstephan yeast strain so I was very excited. What I got was a beer that had the smell, but was not cloudy at all and had that ""every other beer Otter makes"" aftertaste. I didn’t really taste anything like a hefeweizen until the bottom quarter of the pint. Terribly disappointing, and someone needs to tell the brewmaster to sterilize those fermentation tanks between runs so the beers don’t all taste the same."

Alt-Reuther Zoigl Bier;Reuth, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Schloßbrauerei Reuth;Bottle. Pours clear copper with a white head. Aroma of grass, caramel, hay, harsh grains, hay, caramel, slight citrusy, light toasted malts. Taste is rather bitter, notes of bready malts - biscuits, sligt citrus, hay. Past is prime.
Alt-Reuther Zoigl Bier;Reuth, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Schloßbrauerei Reuth;Draft at Zoiglwirtschaft d’Eisenbahn in Vohenstrauss: Hazed pumpkin with a golden shimmer. Broken and uneven collar of foam. Soft and mellow, but polished, aroma of orangey esters, toast, powdered chalky candy (Fun Dip), honeysuckle, yeast, and lemon. Slightly airy, as well. Excessive carbonic acid is prickly and seltzery. Initial sip shows nice balance between fruity and firmly malty, with delectable notes of deep toast and haylike pils malt. Stiff punch of minerals and a lightly sulfurous twinge of yeast add character. Discordant carbonation displaces much of the floral vibrancy of the Hallertau and yields a borderline stark and hollow center, but thankfully the well-extracted cookielike malt persists. Fruitiness is more of the unripe peach variety rather than supple marmalade, though an adequate dose of oily lemony acids helps compensate for the lack of richness. Flavor intensity tapers off in the dry and snappily toasty, yet empty, finish. Lemon is subtle as it lingers. No apparent flaws here other than the pointy carbonation, and it does lack the soulfulness of the high-quality examples of the style, but in the end it’s a very quaffable, if simple, Zoigl.
Alt-Reuther Zoigl Bier;Reuth, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Schloßbrauerei Reuth;Draft at Zoiglwirtschaft d Eisenbahn in Vohenstrauss. Hazed amber-gold with a white head of decent retention. Aroma is lightly hoppy and malty with notes of floral lemon, cracked pepper, toasted cereals, wheat crackers. Mostly clean aroma and flavor profile, it’s an extremely gassy beer and even with some of the carbonation shook out it still strongly subdues the malt sugar, which comes across as saccharine / nutri-sweet impression at warmer temperatures. Medium-light bodied, light to medium sweetness with balanced bitterness. It’s carbonic, zesty and toasty, but not all that complex or rich, coming across a little too pointed / sharp, especially in the finish. Still a decent drinker with adequate hop expression.

Kamikokoro Ohshima Shuichi Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Asaguchi-gun, Okayama, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Kamikokoro Brewery Co., Ltd.;500ml bottle pours out a sand color no head. Nose is melons stone fruit booze and some sweetness. Taste is more of the fruit notes heat and a little sweetness.
Kamikokoro Ohshima Shuichi Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Asaguchi-gun, Okayama, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Kamikokoro Brewery Co., Ltd.;500mL Bottle: Pours a light beige color with thick legs and a light misty haze that could be confused for condensate on the glass. The nose is bright and fruity, lots of light anise, pear skin and peach. Fair amount of heat hides behind this sweet fruity curtain. Warm alcohol but only to convey the flavors. Moderate acidity washes up with the sweetness, I find it moderately sweet, although it’s probably -2 or -1 on the scale. I always undershoot these junmai daiginjos. Very nice and delicious. Good enough to finish the bottle, I think I will.
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head. Smells of spices of cinnamon, clove, coriander, lemons, and grass. Coriander overwhelms the palate with cinnamon, clove, lemon grass. The fiinsh is rather spicey.
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Refrigerated bottle poured into a shaker. Taste was herbal and lots of chamomile. I don’t really like this one.
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Reviewed from notes. Poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy yellow color with a bit of a light apricot hue. White head that doesn’t persist for long. The nose is...whoa. There is a lot going on. It’s all a bit too much and I don’t think everything comes together at all. I get some lemon, tea, flowers, chamomile, grass, and a bit of grain. The taste worsens this as there is a weird sort of bitterness from all these earthy, plant-like flavors. Feel is a bit astringent. In the end, I really did not enjoy this. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 11-13-2010
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Wow, just wow. I was stoked to find this awful tick in my friends fridge. Bottled 11/19/10. I had this when it was fresh but I didn’t review it. Also back then I didn’t know anything about saisons. A- This is a pretty dark saison. Deep amber red. Short head with slouchy lacing. S- Weird. Butter, toffee, salt, pepper, hay and a weird funky earthiness. T- A mish-mash of damp spices and mold. A strange butteriness comes in toe with cheese. This finish is bizarre and alarming. M- Very, very dry. I need some water.
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Light gold color with small head. Aroma and flavor are pretty weak, but still have nice light hoppy and bretty notes with some faint fruitiness. It’s okay
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);From 12 ounce bottle. Pours hazy gold with loose white head. Yeasty bread aroma with some grassy and floral notes. Thin on the palate with malt, lemon, and a weak, astringent bitterness. Not a standout - not a great example of the style.
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);I would have to agree with those who say Great Lakes make some great beers. However, I was given this beer by a friend to ensure he wasn’t crazy. I assure you, he is not. The beer is beautiful in color and produces a nice head. The initial smell I picked up was saison yeast, just a slight fruitiness. Drinking tastes like a mouthfull of mown grass. Overwhelming mown grass, and not at all in a good way. Shared the glass with two others. After 3 drinks, I poured it down the drain, something I have never done. I’m thinking you should save those herbs for tea and pasta. Way to screw up what is probably a very nice saison.
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Smells like a cheap French Hooker. Rarely have had bad brews from Great Lakes but Chamomile? C’mon guys. Lemon balm? Sounds more like a chcik’s shampoo than beer. This was the first six pack I’ve bought in years that I couldn’t finish.
Great Lakes Grassroots Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);Poured a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma was of grass and melon with odd notes of shrimp. Yes I said shrimp. Malty flavor with a taste of cut grass. Medium bodied.

Odd finish , like fresh hay with a bit of shuger , slightly dry ,medium body for the style , slightly chalky mouthfeel . Drinkable , and could be sessionable but one of these is plenty for me , not really sure why but just not what im looking for .
Mineno Hakubai (White Blossom on the Hill) Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Niigata, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Fukui Shuzo CO. LTD (Niigata);Bottle: Pours a crystal clear color with a decent amount of legs. The nose is earthy with some masculine koji, fresh spring onion, potato and kiwi skin. The impact is dry initially but the acidity doesn’t kick in until later, so the mouthfeel feels thick and sweet but it doesn’t taste sweet at all. The low acidity and +3 rating are certainly a sweet spot for me. A more fragrant yeast or rice varietal might perk this one right up. It certainly transports me back to Japan though with the mild koji and rich umami. Yum!
Moat Mountain Belgian Saison;North Conway, New Hampshire, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Moat Mountain Smoke House & Brewing Company;Very cloudy, tan beer. Looks like a milkshake. Aroma is fairly spicy with banana/apple and some light peachiness as well. Flavour shows peach and apple, lean wheaty body, some yeasty breadiness in back of all of the spiciness and esters. Light black pepper spiciness. Nice balance of fruit and spice. Could be a whole lot dryer, but it’s still tasty enough.
Moat Mountain Belgian Saison;North Conway, New Hampshire, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Moat Mountain Smoke House & Brewing Company;Stopped at the brewpub, and was pleasantly surprised by this.

Moat Mountain Belgian Saison;North Conway, New Hampshire, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Moat Mountain Smoke House & Brewing Company;Stopped at the Moat Mountain restaurant for lunch while on vacation recently and we tried a few brews. This was our first selection and it was pretty good. A lot of quality craftsmanship was apparent in the flavoring and texture. The pour was a cloudy orange/gold with a nice white head. A flowery aroma was capped by a sweet caramelly malt flavoring. Excellent.

It was explained to me by the bartender that this is a blend of TR’s IPAX and Titanium made specifically for Pete’s Brass Rail. The pours is murky and light brown with a white head. This isn’t the best looking beer, that’s for sure. The aroma is malty with a grapefruit hop note. Hop forward flavor with more citrus notes. Tastes like it may have some wheat in it. Very dry finish.
The Brew Kettle Pumpkinhead;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Kettle;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear, copper-amber colored body with a thin, frothy, beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is some pumpkin spices with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a bit of ginger with a nice malt sweetness consisting of some toffee bread, a touch of toast, and a light caramel. Flavor is similar. Some bready toffees, a light toast, and caramel up front before an even amount of pumpkin spices come in. Nutmeg, a bit of ginger, and a light cinnamon that increases slightly towards the end as this dries with a light toasted toffee sweetness and balanced spicing. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice pumpkin beer. Pleasantly spiced and a light sweetness that is all well balanced and easy drinking. Solid.

The Brew Kettle Pumpkinhead;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Kettle;I was glad to see Brew Kettle still serving a pumpkin beer during my visit in late December...seems like a lot of brewers plan to sell out of pumpkin beer by Thanksgiving, and to me the flavor is appropriate through the new year. This one is a touch light on the pumpkin and maybe too light in the body, but is nonetheless a very solid beer with lots of nutmeg and other spice. Appearance-wise, it looked a great deal like the Chief’s Rye - not quite colorful enough in the amber body, and with a medium amount of head. Aroma was very spicy, but both the aroma and taste led me to doubt the inclusion of actual pumpkin in the recipe, although the menu said it was in there. Flavor was more spice than pumpkin, with lots of nutmeg and I thought it pretty good. Mouthfeel was pretty good. A nice beer. I would recommend this beer. I had it on-tap at the Brew Kettle in Strongsville.
The Brew Kettle Pumpkinhead;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Kettle;On tap at the brewery. They are calling it pumpkinhead ale. I’m guessing this is the same version.

Its pretty spicy. I enjoyed this more than most pumpkin ales and its up there with the best in my mind.

Wagner Valley Coffee Porter;Lodi, New York, United States;Porter;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;"12oz bottle. I worked for Wagner’s for two years. During my 2 years, I spent much time at the fabled ""House,"" where general cacophony occurred nightly. Upon exploring the basement of The House, a few coworkers and myself discovered several bottles of beer, aged nearly 5 years. These bottles, and The House, had belonged to the owner of Wanger’s- legendary Bill Wagner. We drank these beers like little regard for history, and soon regretted it. These beers had aged like a cheap Parisian trollop. 1 of these lethal brews was enough to cause fall-down drunkenness. Nevertheless, we soldiered on..."

Wagner Valley Coffee Porter;Lodi, New York, United States;Porter;Wagner Valley Brewing Company;Sample from a bottle. Fresh, sharp vegetal espresso nose, really bright coffee in the aroma, and very rich smelling as well. Lightly pasty/empty texture, medium-to-light frothiness. Coffee flavors prevalent, with some light roast, if any, or maybe more of a burnt dark roasted coffee flavor, and I’m just thinking roast. The coffee is quite delicious – I love coffee stout – but it covers pretty much the entire ‘porter’ in this porter. Still a solid coffee beer.

Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Not too bad. Big on malt if that is your thing. It has an interesting aroma which is mainly dominated by the malty character. Poured as a clear golden colour. Minimal head which was dissappointing.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;330ml bottle. Surprising in a good way. Bright amber in colour with a wavy uneven white foam that goes quickly but sticks to the side of the glass. Well carbonated with a hop aroma and smooth texture in the mouth. Worth hunting for.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Dull orangey amber body with poor head. Caramelly sweet aroma, some cardboardy notes in the taste as well as the caramel. Drinkable for some people just not for me.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Bottle. Pours a deep orange with a small white head. Disappeared pretty quickly leaving no lacing. Initially nice malty aromas with a hint of citurs hop aromas. As the beer warmed slightly however the nose turned quite harsh with a weird sweetish aroma. Something I couldn’t quite place though. Flavours unfrotunately were much the same. Initially some malt and hops but the this harsh after taste. Didn’t like this one unfortunately.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Not a bad beer and nice to see a brewer going for a Lager style over ales. Slight malt nose, pour is amber with an off white head. Flavour is a mix of initial biscuity malt with some fruity back end flavour that has a slightly washed out finish.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;This did not seem like a lager to me but more of an american pale ale. A nice reddish/ golden hue. Lots of citrus and florals in the taste and aroma. Above average I thought.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Dunno where our esteemed colleague Sully got his story from, but my bottle tells a different version. Apparently the Platt on my bottle had 2000 acres up in the Hunter Valley back in the 1820’s and failed in his ventures into timber milling, farming and coal mining. The only link to the beer is that the brewery’s next to where the old homestead was! Anyway, on to the beer... which looked decent with a golden orange hue and moderately lasting head. Nice enough floral aroma with some musk and a touch of toasty malt appearing after a while. Fairly bitter, and not just like sucking on copper coins which can be a feature of many Australian beers. Medium bodied, the carbonation is pretty close to the mark, but the aftertaste is forgettable. A step above the macros, but not much to really rave about.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;In the bottle from the Bottle-O in Newcastle. Rich gold in color with a poofy, but fleeting white head. It seems to me that Oz lagers come in 2 types- no flavorand just a hint of flavor. This falls in the latter category. I’m getting just a bit of hop-induced floral flavor and a slight residual bitterness post quaff. Better than many, but not worth flying to Australia to try.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;The story of this brew is some ramble about silly old Platt and the folly of trying to grow grapes or some such crap. He embarked on brewing in the ’20s and so it was said he had hit on a winner with his lager brewed to the old style of beers, using only the best blah blah blah. I’ll tell you the bloody folly my lad. The belief that this is significantly different from your typical Aussie pale lager. A bit more complexity than the macrocrap but really, where is all the substance to support the guff they go on with? Just another beer with some small degree of malt and hop balance but as characterless as a Kevin Costner performance.
Steel River Platts Folly Old World Lager;Newcastle, NSW, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Steel River Brewery;Rerate 11/1/07: The gulf between fresh draught lager and the bottled version is often broad. The arrival of this in bottles in Sydney offered a chance for a comparison, and regrettably, a downgrade. The bottled version is more muted in the glass, but still fruity and summery on the nose. Quite a full mouthfeel for a lager, soft and morish. Pleasantly fruity but with an unwelcome late astringency that I didn’t pick in the draught version. Bit of a disconnect between the summery fruits at the front of the palate and the harshness of the finish. Still drinkable but not as fine as it seemed on a warm spring afternoon sitting outside the Australian Hotel. Original rating: This was the first of two lagers brewed by this new venture based in Newcastle, NSW. The second, Steel River Lager, was created later to cater for macro lager drinkers who found this too demanding. At least, that’s my understanding based on a conversation with the brewer at the recent beer festival at Sydney’s Australian Hotel. This is fruitier, a little stronger and more complex than SRL but the differences are so marginal that I’d be surprised if this survives once the range expands. It’s a deeper gold than SRL with excellent head retention. Bit nutty at first sniff, with the same lychee fruity notes, a hint of attic and a faint herbal quality. Quite subtle and hard to pin down. Medium bodied and softly carbonated. Not as malty as SRL, with a more pronounced hop presence. Very fruity - lychee and blackcurrants, quite tart in the swallow, with some sherbet. Undemanding summer drinking. Original score: 6/4/6/3/12 (3.1). (Draught at Australian Hotel beerfest)
Muskie Capital IPA;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Muskie Capital Brewery;Sampled draught at the Autumn Brew Review in Minneapolis, October 7 2006. Not as impressed with this one as JK was though it’s competently put together....dull, dirty amber in complexion with little head....fairly weak and typical PNW hoppy nose, stronger on the twiggy-bark notes than citrus, touch of caramel malt....body is much more caramelly-sweet, just lightly bitter, clean enough but for me terribly boring and by-the-numbers. Their saison was much better.
Muskie Capital IPA;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Muskie Capital Brewery;ABR 2006. This is a solid ipa, very drinkable if not outstanding. The aroma is herbal hops and promises a bitter flavor. The flavor is more hops, bitter, some flowery and a little spicy. Dark orange. Good effort.
Fitgers Parrs Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;Great beer! Always excited when this is on tap! I wish this is one they had year round!
Fitgers Parrs Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;On draught at the Fitger’s brewpub in downtown Duluth, MN. Pours a clear, near opaque dark reddish brown colored brew with a creamy off-white head that has some nice retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted dark malt, a hint of coffee, some roasted nuts and light grapefruit. Taste is medium bodied, flavors of toasted dark malt, a hint of grapefruit, coffee and and light chocolate. Finish has a mild citrus bitterness with a lingering toasted dark malt/coffee aftertaste. One of the more hoppier porters I’ve tried.
Fitgers Parrs Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;Very dark brown with a short lasting head. Definitely walnuts and a little coffee and chalk. Just enough innocuous hops to balance. OK, not real special
Fitgers Parrs Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;REAL ALE TENT @ GTMW 2008: Dark brown and very good head and lace. The aroma has notes of prune, walnut, caramel and chalky yeast esters. The taste is twangy and fruity on top of dark dry malts, woody finish. The mouth feel is soft and smooth. An okay porter, you could worse.
Fitgers Parrs Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;On cask at GTMW. Poured clear medium-deep brown with a loose cap of off-white head. The aroma picked up toasty lighter chocolate and caramel notes joined by a faint, well-placed smoky presence.. solid. The flavor had caramel and semi-sweet chocolate at the core with dry coffee and earthy bitterness around.. dry, lighter, non-descript finish. Lighter-bodied and dry on the palate with a nice choice of malts, but perhaps not enough of them especially toward the back.. this may have been better with a little CO2 behind it.
Fitgers Parrs Porter;Duluth, Minnesota, United States;Porter;Fitgers Brewhouse;I can’t find this on the Fitger’s website but there are a few references to this beer on the Internet. It looks like a tribute to someone at Fitger’s. Anyway, it is a better than average porter. This beer has substantial palate, but it is not as thick as their stout. The beer is black and has a small head. Some dried fruit in the aroma, and roasted malt and light, sweet fruit in the flavor.

New Sweden;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;50 cL can. Pours clear and golden yellow with a huge white head. Cornish and malty aroma. Semi sweet and slight syrupy flavoured with a mild bitterness and slight cornish ntoe coming through. Ends medium bitter and dry.
New Sweden;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;Can. High white fluffy and lasting white head. Clear yellow body with an awful lot of bubbles. Weak barley malt and corn I guess. Flavor very mild and sweet barley malt and my suspicion of corn is increasing. In spite of the many bubbles the beer is low carbonated, or the carbonation dies quickly. Short sweet aftertaste.
New Sweden;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;Can. Medium head with medium duration. Color is golden. Aroma and taste are malt, hops and caramel.
New Sweden;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;500 ml can. Golden colour. Crystal clear. Very tall fine-laced white head that clings to the glass. Clean grassy hop aroma. Initial bitterness. Smooth texture with high carbonation mixed with oily malt flavours. Feels rather rich, and reminds me a bit of the contemporary Oktoberfestbiers. Finishes with a metallic bitterness that cuts through the oily malts.
New Sweden;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;Sweet, dusty grain on aroma. Gets better as you taste it with some nice and not so sweet caramel flavour. Not very exciting, though.
New Sweden;Falkenberg, Sweden;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlsberg Sverige;Big offwhite lasting head. Coppery yellow body. Clean malty neutral aroma with faint peppery hops. Traces of rubber. Dry-sweet light malty corn taste. Sharp fizzy mouthfeel. Dry rubbery watery corn aftertaste with grainy notes. Bland. (0.5l can, Systembolaget, Göteborg.)
Pražský Premium Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Bright yellow. Bubbly head that doesn’t last long. Super saccharine. Not great.
Pražský Premium Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);You get what you pay for and more with 4 cans for 5 euro. Pleasantly surprised by the taste and aroma. Would recommend if on a tight budget.
Pražský Premium Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Im from Ireland, great drink, great price (4 for €5) always sold out in my local shop, regardless of that, overall very good and sits well!

Pražský Premium Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Can from Centra [190315] Had Tyskie on the same night and this was a bit better. Dirt cheap at only €4 for 4 cans. Drinkable enough so up to 2.2 Can from Centra, Mohill [030814] 3/3/4/2/8 2 Golden yellow, clear, frothy white head Aroma of light lager malts, soft cardboard, little on nose Taste of pale lager malts, bit of cardboard, some light sweet malt, not much taste but no nasty flavours. Palate - soft carb, light body, slightly sweet. Finish has a slight rough bitterness. Overall - Dirt cheap at only €5 for 4 cans ... Actually tastes better than the crap Heineken from the pub at €4/pint. Bit better than a lot of macro lagers. Quite drinkable. Good buy for the money.
Pražský Premium Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Can from Continental Food Store, Wakefield. Golden-yellow with no head. Dryish textured lager with some flavour to it.
Pražský Premium Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);Gold pour with watery white head and lace. Aroma is a bit skunky. Corn and sweet malt flavor with not much of a bitter. Medium bodied with ok carbonation. a beer that tasted better than it smelled.
Pražský Premium Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);500 ml can picked up in Ireland. pours a pale yellow with a big soft white head. Aroma is hops and urine. Taste is better but butterscoch and cardboard. not terible and the palate ends sweet. Dont know what to make of it really. Better than most cheap macros but blah.
Pražský Premium Czech Lager;Prague, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Staropramen Breweries (Molson Coors);I shouldn’t be surprised that this is the kind of beer that Panamanian Super markets import. It’s almost as bad as an Atlas or Panama lager. Smells and tastes pissy, drinks flat and has a sour aftertaste. Of all the Czech lagers to import.
The Livery Doubt Stout;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;The Livery;Anniversary Trip 2007 5/17/2007: Very black with an ultra creamy head and dense lacing from the top to the bottom of the glass. Aroma is dry and roasty as is the flavor. There is also dark chocolate and a hint of an ashy/aspirin quality in the flavor as well. Medium-full body and creamy. This is a Dry Stout that delivers on the dry! Draught sample (4.5% ABV) at The Livery in Benton Harbor, Michigan.
The Livery Doubt Stout;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;The Livery;"Tap at brewery and served in pint glass: I really did not take good notes on this one, more about the conversion and the ""early sample of a future release"" than I was worried about note taking. I few comments I did write down include: Chocolate, rye, coffee, bitter, clean and simply smooth. A fresh ""dry"" stout and is so much better than the commercial beers. That is all..."
The Livery Doubt Stout;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;The Livery;"10 ounce pour at the brewpub. Opaque black with a creamy brown head. Strong hoppy aroma with roast and coffee. ""Guiness"" twang with chocolate and coffee flavors. Light body witha a dry finish. Pretty enjoyable."
The Livery Doubt Stout;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Stout - Dry;The Livery;Draft sample at brewpub. Poured dark brown with a average creamy brown head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Heavy complex roasted coffee aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture. Medium roasted sweet flavor with a medium burnt bitter finish of long duration. This is a standout beer.
Crown Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);A rich mans carlton draught. Pretty much just as bad but has a nice looking bottle
Crown Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Gold pour good strength carbonation aroma metallic grasy flavour metallic sweet some malt soapy but that usual taste finish metallic grasy note soapy ver off putting
Crown Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);"Bottle. I had this at Daikoku restaurant in Nadi, Fiji. The meal was fantastic, but the beer was a bit of a dud. No BBD on the bottle, but I think this one has been ""on the menu"" a while! Pale yellow, grainy, on the watery side, no hop character at all really. Dry boxboard finish."
Crown Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Very watery and flat tasting. Poured with almost no head - a very ordinary beer. Glad I only bought one bottle.
Crown Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);No mention of CUB on the label but this is watered down VB. No head at all. Mild watery taste with the usual CUB metallic taste. Actually better than Crown because it is watered down. Nasty.
Crown Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);I paid a lot of cash for 6 bottles of these, and By God was I let down. Terrible, it makes Heineken look like the nectar of the gods.
Crown Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Thought I might get this out the way as quick as possible. Like ripping off a band-aid, sneak this one in between pints and its all over. Not that I doubt it being an award winning, complex and balanced lager. No ’pfffft’ when I cracked it but sure enough the CO2 erupted once it hit the glass. Clear, medium gold, typically Australian looking with lots of carbonation and a big, fluffy white crown that legged it well. Metallic ’rusted-car-body’ and stale hop nose with just a little watered down lemon cordial. Soapy and wishy-washy in the mouth, featherweight in body and stretched for flavour. Slightly dank, metal tinged flavours with a flutter of malt showing. Finish holds very little, though an unsalted peanut flavour lingers. Tastes a little chlorinated too. Sadly this was better than a standard Crownie in the fact that it went down with more ease and was honestly less offensive. Still, clear bottle, very little flavour and mid-strength, hmmmm! (375mL, 28/06/07, The Beer Store, Morley)
Crown Gold;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Picked up two stubbies of this to try out but the second one may sit in the fridge because one is more than enough. Clear bronze body, which was darker than I was expecting, on a rocky average size white head. Hops on the nose that don’t smell that fresh. Taste is what the nose promises, not much! CUB have released another winner, now waiting for the Crown Pilsener which may be dearer than the real crownie.

Fire Station 5 Bunker Gear Winter Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Mahogany color pour with a cream colored head. Smells like a caramel malty sweet treat. Taste started off sweet but quickly fell into a bitter aftertaste mess. Left an astringent flavor in my mouth with a metallic feel as well. I can’t say that I enjoyed this brew, it started with promise but fell short in delivery. I hope the other Fire Station Brews are better than this one...pretty cheap to obtain for a craft brew, but fell short, too short.
Fire Station 5 Bunker Gear Winter Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"Great, sweet aroma. Pours to a nice, rich-looking brown color with minimal head and lacing. Nice, medium-bodied flavor. Not overly strong flavor; drinkable. Nice, palate. A very enjoyable winter beer, although not as potent as some other winter beers. I’m usually albe to pick this beer up at a good price, to boot."
Fire Station 5 Bunker Gear Winter Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);[12oz Bottle] A deep dark brownish color with a light head. This has a carmel and toffee aroma but it was very lgith. The beer was lacking in deep rich winter ale flavor and the matalic flavors where presnt again somehtign in this brewing process they get the metal in it. This brew just lacks and was a begginers type winter ale.
Fire Station 5 Bunker Gear Winter Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);12-oz. Gorgeous looking. Pours a deep dark and very clear brown with nice tinges of garnet highlights. Big thick light tan head, moussy and lightly bubbly. Strong caramel & two-row malt beaming through on the nose. Subdued attack: medium body, low carb, moderate flavors. Two-row, biscuit, and caramel on the palate, with some c-hop at the end. Some slightly astringent alcohol fumes on the finish. Drinkable, fairly well complete in its thinking, and dull. I don’t see the alcohol or the thinness quite so tragically as the last reviewer. I would probably drink this stuff again if they were offering it for nothing, but wouldn’t push it much farther than that.
Fire Station 5 Bunker Gear Winter Ale;Portland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Portland Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);"12 0z brown long neck. Quite a surprisingly attractive ale to look at dark amber almost brown, reddish tinges and a huge thick tan head, nice. Aroma is weak, but not unpleasant mostly choclate styled malts. Flavour again is all malt getting a little bitterness near the end, low carbonation , which i think helps this pretty thin ""winter ale"" Unfortunatlly some alcohol shows..pretty bad for a 6.5% beer. Too thin on the palte only saved by the low carbonation. Not a good beer really. Just the usual second rate stuff for this contract brew."
Amsterdam Oktoberfest (2006);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Amsterdam Brewing Company;on draft at Smokeless Joes, brown copper colour, smoked peat on the nose, decent brew, not as smokey as i would have liked but nice. could have drank a few more pints
Amsterdam Oktoberfest (2006);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Amsterdam Brewing Company;Tap at Volo. Malty nose, slightly medicinal with hints of vanilla, darker roasted accents show up late. Brown appearance with neat ruby hue, bright white top contrasting neatly with darker base. I was surprised with smoked malts up front which were well balanced and leaving long lasting aftertaste. Late mineral touches. Smoked Okto?
Amsterdam Oktoberfest (2006);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Amsterdam Brewing Company;Draught at Smokeless Joe. Pours a clear reddish-amber with a spare diminishing white head. Mild, sweet malty aroma with some faint smoke. Watery flavour of sweet malt, faint smoke and a very light bitterness. There’s an unpleasant hint of alcohol/metal in the flavour and I didn’t care much for the aftertaste. Light bodied. Another mediocre (at best) Amesterdam beer.
Amsterdam Oktoberfest (2006);Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Amsterdam Brewing Company;Draught. At Volo. Poured a deep clear copper with a decent white head. Aroma of roast malt, woodsmoke and peat, mild hops. When I tasted it I had to ask if they’d poured me a Church Key Holy Smoke instead - very smokey and earthy, tangy roast malt and mild herbal hops for a base - I really liked it, I didn’t get metal, I got a nice minerally peat character to it. Medium body but nice and sticky, lightly carbonated and astringent with a reasonably quick minerally finish - easily one of the best Amsterdams yet - almost a rauchbier.
Brewsters High Five Wheat Ale;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Wheat Ale;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;An intentionally weird combination of American wheat and caramel. Dark copper. Minimal head. Caramel malt and a touch of vanilla. The caramel malt is too strong for the German hops and the wheat. Oh well, it’s for charity.
Red Hill Imperial Stout;Red Hill, VIC, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Red Hill Brewery;Aroma: carbon, malt & light fruity notes Appearance: black, tiny head, no lacing, highlights of brown Flavour: sweet malt, some caramel & carbon Palate: Thin and gently carbonated
Red Hill Imperial Stout;Red Hill, VIC, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Red Hill Brewery;Tap at Slowbeer, Richmond, Melbourne. Poured a clear dark brown with a frothy tan head.

Medium to full bodied with soft carbonation.
Red Hill Imperial Stout;Red Hill, VIC, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Red Hill Brewery;27Nov2017 Dark roast malts, dark roast filter coffee, dark chocolate, cacao, charcoal.

Red Hill Imperial Stout;Red Hill, VIC, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Red Hill Brewery;Pours dark brown, mocha head. Nose is coffee, molasses, vanilla, plum, raisins. Flavor is more of the same, sweet toffee, lots of raisin and fig, coffee on the finish. Very complex and layered flavor, really delightful. You get a nice transition between the sweetness of the mid palate and the coffee notes on the end. Gorgeous, really really gorgeous.
Red Hill Imperial Stout;Red Hill, VIC, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Red Hill Brewery;East of Everything ontap(24-Sep-16)Choc coffee malt aroma. Black,solid cream head&sticky sheet lace. Coffee herbal veg flavour. Bitter coffee finish&roast malt aftertaste.
Red Hill Imperial Stout;Red Hill, VIC, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Red Hill Brewery;"6/8/2016 - draught at Red Hill Brewery - same as comments for bottled version. 11/6/2016 - bottle- Poured an opaque black with a one-finger light tan dense foam head that retained for ages but laced poorly. Carbonation low to moderate. Aroma subtly of chocolate, roasted coffee and syrup/treacle. Taste of sweet brown sugars, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruits and vanilla with alcohol on the back palate; low bitterness. Medium body but a little thin for the style. Smooth and creamy with a lingering subtly sweet vanilla finish that also has alcohol notes. Nice enough."
Red Hill Imperial Stout;Red Hill, VIC, Australia;Stout - Imperial;Red Hill Brewery;Aroma - strong and simple Taste - 10/10 Full bodied, with slight coffee taste. Beautiful malts. Very creamy (maybe slightly too much) Simple stout flavours, its not trying to be anything else apart from a stout which is refreshing these days. Surprisingly hoppy bitterness to end on. After taste - Beautiful lingering taste, with that full body malty taste hanging on for a long while. Tip: Sensational with a bit of good quality dark chocolate!
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle gift from SJ. thin / watery body, notes of bold coco and chocolate. Some roasted malts. It was ok, but highly overrated.
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);WOW the king of kings 2006 bottle thanks to Skyview pours reddish black and rather thin with the aromas being of chocolate and chocolate i was EXPECTING PURE GARBAGE but anything it was far from it rather a very tastey treat for a chocolate lover a real chocolate beer and from a Macro
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle - 2006… Clear, very dark lager that is impenetrable to even the Florida sun. Small, creamy, khaki head with fantastic retention. Nice chocolaty aroma, very reminiscent to Southern Tier’s Choklat - I like it. Full-bodied and creamy with barbed carbonation. The flavor is very chocolaty and a little too sweet for my palate – almost cloying - and I have a big-time sweet tooth. The finish is also sweet and chocolaty. Age might have something to do with the complete lack of balance, but either way, this is pretty darned great for a Miller product. Major thanks to Skyview for providing the bottle!
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12 oz bottle into a pint glass Aroma is mainly milk chocolate and the flavor is sweet chocolate with a lingering dark chocolate flavor. Really not too bad.
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz bottle from 2006 thanks to 3Faveryrogue. Pours dark brown with a small beige head. Has a fair amount of sediment. Still very well carbonated after three years. Aroma is of cocoa, caramel, malt, and wheat. Taste is of chocolate, caramel, a slight bit of wood, malt, and wheat. Mouthfeel was very light and crisp. Only had the slightest hint of being oxidized. Lingering taste of dry chocolate. Has a lot of drinkability for a chocolate lager. Definitely the best Miller product that has been made.
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I probably consumed the last two 4-packs in existence. OK. Maybe theres some more of this floating around, but highly doubtful. REALLY glad I found this gem. $4.99/pk from the local beer museum. Bunker had some, planted someones vomit in my frontroom shortly afterward, and tried destroying the evidence. Bastard. On to the beer..... Vintage 06. Survived time extremely well. 7/10/09. Great pssst. Nice dark pour, and respectable head. This beer smelled perfect. Not so stouty. Chocolate truffle, wafers, swiss miss, hersheys bar. Some lager and maybe a trace of that wheat somewhere. Point well made. Chocolate beer. Flavor and mouth excellent. Crisp finish. Taste is NOTHING like a Southern Tier Choklat or Mokah. Those come off as syrupy chocolate sodas. Way too overpowering to drink a 22 to oneself. THIS is a sessionable chocolate brew. Surprised that this didnt WOO the masses. Wish there was tons more available. Best Miller product ever.
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours dark brown with a tan head. Aroma of chocolate. Chocolate flavor. Very sweet.
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Pours a deep red brown with a thin beige head. No lace. Potent chocolate aroma, specifically of tootsie roll candy. This is a good thing. Flavor is also dominated by the same sweet chocolate elements. Caramel-malty in a cream soda sense. The malts are slightly papery; this is the only offness in this beer. Medium bodied, smooth on the swallow."
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);(11/3/08) Bottle sample at a tasting in Pizza Port in Carlsbad (thanks whoever). I hope this is the right beer because what I tried just had a hand-made label for some competition. Brown color. Aroma of dark bitter chocolate and cocoa. Sweet flavor of dark chocolate, some malt and caramel notes. Medium-bodied. Like liquid chocolate.
Frederick Miller Classic Chocolate Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Other;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);2006 12oz Twist-off. Thanks Sean! Rather vibrant cocoa nib chocolate nose. Bits of dutch liqeur, Irish Creme, and Smores. A bit saccarhin, dusty and reduced, but decent. Pours a mid-brown, chesnut cloud, with a fast fading creamy tan head. Flavor reminds me of alcohol prepackaged hot chocolate, done cold. Liquor-like. This tastes a lot like someone added a bunch of sugar and chocolate liqeur to Seltzer water. I appreciate the carbonation level, but the flavor is a little brash. Wheat lager? I might be able to pick up a touch of that, but I don’t know. Okay, so actually this isn’t terrible. It has flavor, isn’t overly sweet or weird. I can dig that. Probably the best beer I’ll ever have from Miller.
Oak Creek Pilsener;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Oak Creek Brewing Company;On tap at the resort location in Sedona. Poured a brilliant pale golden color w/ a medium sized, semi creamy froth. Good residual lacing. Aroma of sweet malts w/ a hint of crispy spice. Nice! Full nectar with soft residual effers. Very creamy. It’s so thik you can chew on it. A huge malty backbone and a moderate sweetness factor w/ a candy spice character. The finish is long w/ a refined velvety bitterness that lingers. It was cold that night and this brew kept me warm. Highly recommended.
Oak Creek Earth Angel Belgian Saison;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Oak Creek Brewing Company;What better way to enjoy a sunny late afternoon after hiking Bell Rock in Sedona than with a classic Belgian farmhouse ale? Well, I wouldn’t exactly call Oak Creek’s Saison a classic or a particularly faithful representation of the style but it’s a refreshing brew and I was lucky enough to enjoy it on the deck of their brewpub at Tlaquepaque. Hard for any beer to go wrong in that setting. That said, it pours a hazy orange (which looks particularly good against the backdrop of the Sedona red rocks) with a two finger moderately dense white head. Mildly yeasty aroma with fresh citrus and corriander. Crisp and lightly hoppy flavor with herbal notes that tip a bit closer to a wit than a traditional saison. Soft mouthfeel that’s a tad watery for the style but pleasing nonetheless. Crisp and slightly peppery finish. Not a great saison but still apretty well crafted and refreshing brew. It’s their current seasonal offering so you’ll need to head out there within the next several weeks to give it a try.
Oak Creek Earth Angel Belgian Saison;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Sampled on tap @ the brewery...seasonal selection. Bright Florida orange body with a lemon-colored 1/2 inch head. Aroma is citrus and indistinguishable spice...flavor mostly tangerine with minimal banana notes. Wasn’t crisp at all, more of a mandarin hefe...
Oak Creek Earth Angel Belgian Saison;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Oak Creek Brewing Company;On tap @ th brewery. Server said it was a seasonal ale. It was served with a big massive Orange wedge floating in the glass. So, I quickly fished the wedge out of the glass and flung it on to the floor. Anyway, annoyed, I fledged on...........Appearance and aroma were pretty much spot on for a saison. It was a little thin in body, but that is probably because it was sloppily poured into a pint glass and lost a whole bunch of fizz. It wasn’t very cold either which was strange. In short, this was a pretty good beer, but it could be enjoyed much more if the bar had any clue how to serve it properly.
Oak Creek Earth Angel Belgian Saison;Sedona, Arizona, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Oak Creek Brewing Company;Had this on tap at the brewery. Pours a hazed golden with a slight orange hue. Aroma was malty w/ banana spice and rock candy. Medium nectar w/ mellow residual effers. Flavors are on the malty side w/ the usual banana spice but there was also a slight pumpkin thing going on. Interesting enough. It lacked the crispness I find in the usual Saison profile but was a great specimen none the less. It had a mellow lemon rind bittering on the finish. I liked it better cold.
Brok Strong;Koszalin, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Amber, beige head. Nice fruity malty nose, quite exotic. Taste is malty sweet with the same fine fruits.
Brok Strong;Koszalin, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Koszalin (Van Pur);Tasting from Jul’ 2008. Shimmering auburn amber body riddled by furious, hasty to rise medium sized bubbles that lift a mere quarter inch of compact, creamy off-white head that lasts and laces well. Strong, sweet, sugary, toasted malt and biscuity nose with good warming, alcohol spice evident. Lifted nutty, sweet caramel and toasted grains in the mouth. A little almond marzipan with burnt bread notes late. Swallow is like a rough praline, nutty and sweet with the alcohol well masked here though a strange chemical taste kicks in faintly late into the aftertaste. Nice rounded body, not heavy, with soft, prickly carbonation. Good linger of sweet malts and roasted nuts. Overall a little one sided but not that bad a beer. Certainly goes down without a blink of the eye-lid! (50cL, BB 27/08/08, International Beer Store, Morley)

This isn’t bad and at 89p a bargain, ok its sweet malty and the alcohol whilst not overpowering sometimes gets in the way but I will happily stock up on a few more at this price.
Big Buck Grand Cru;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Big Buck Brewery;Draught at the Gaylord location: Dark and hazy brown color with a medium thin bone white head. Thin and spotty lacing. Well-spiced aroma along with some malt. Medium-bodied with malt, dark fruit and spice flavors. The finish is spicy and has a bit of alcohol in it.

Wolfs Dunkel;Witten-Durchholz, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Wolfs-Bier;Ein ziemlich trüb-hellbraunes Bier, das es nur in Pfandsyphons oder Fässern zu kaufen gibt. Hier der test aus dem Pfandyphon: Der Geruch ist malzig-säuerlich, der Antrunk etwas sauer, aber nach wenigen Sekunden weicht die Säuerlichkeit einem hervorragenden Malzigen Aroma mit leicht herber Hopfennote, das auch noch lange nach dem Schluck im Mund verbleibt. Einen so charakteristisch-positiven Nachgeschmack hab’ ich schon lange nicht mehr erlebt. Supertoll! Das Aroma erinnert auch etwas an Torf oder Erde - ein Dunkles Bier, wie ich es mir vorstelle!!! Test vom 1.7.2007, Gebinde: sonstiges Noten: 12,15,15,15,6,15 - 14,25 Nach meinem Syphontest letzten Sommer, wo das Bier voll meinen Geschmack traf, nun der Test vom Faß: Der Antrunk ist schön hefig-frisch, der Abgang leicht säuerlich wie Ale, sehr süffig-vollmundig-weich. Im Abgang ist es auch leicht herb, aber nicht zu penetrant. Allerdings kann ich im Gegensatz zu meinem letzten Test überhaupt keine Röstmalzaromen ausfindig machen, auch schmeckt es dieses Mal nicht annähernd so gut, wie bei meinem ersten Test. Komisch.... Vielleicht hat jeder Sud ja seine speziellen Aromen?? Wer weiß... Immer noch ein leckeres Bier, aber dieses mal nicht mehr in meiner Spitzenklasse! Test vom 20.6.2008, Gebinde: Fass Noten: 12,11,12,12,-,12 - 11,84
Wolfs Dunkel;Witten-Durchholz, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Wolfs-Bier;Milder karamellmalziger Antrunk, malziger werdend. Das Bier wirkt unter anderem wegen dem etwas wässrigen Mittelpart frisch. Im Abgang kommt dann die Karamellmalzigkeit erneut zum Vorschein, zudem etwas getreidig. Mit der Zeit erscheint das Bier etwas eindimensional, auch wenn zum Ende hin ein herb-bitterer Ton aufkommt. Test vom 12.5.2008, Gebinde: Fass Noten: 13,8,9,8,-,9

Wolfs Dunkel;Witten-Durchholz, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Wolfs-Bier;"(draught) Hazy, chestnut coloured effervescent hue with a mid-sized, slightly off-white foamy head. Sweet and yeasty, slightly toasted malty aroma with caramel and shy notes of herbal hops. Bitter flavour, light to medium body, crispy carbonated mouthfeel. Initially toast-malty with caramel and a quite strong early evolving herbal bitterness; dry and well-rounded soft malty and herbal hoppy bitter finish. Reminds me of a rural version of Hövels Bitterbier from Dortmund."
Brewer's Alley Wedding Alt;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;Sampled on draft the brewpub this beer poured a caramel brown color with a medium sized foamy orange-tan head that left decent lacing.

Brewer's Alley Wedding Alt;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;Kind of odd, and not really much of an altbier. Pours clear amber with pretty good head and lacing. Some musky wooden aroma. Light sweet finish. Tap at brewpub.
Brewer's Alley Wedding Alt;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;Appearance: medium amber, slightly opaque, short and creamy tan head quickly fading. Aroma: dark brown bread, maybe a hint of caramel, fresh newspaper, and earthy hops. Taste: rustic brown bread, roasted grain, a hint of coffee, and a pronounced lightly sweet nutty note. Finish: clean and dry, with a hint of that nutty roasty malt note lingering. Notes: A pleasantly drinkable beer. Liked the alt-style malty-without-sweetness character, which melded nicely with the nutty aspects. Would drink again, and Zoltan--a true altbier fan if ever there was one--pronounced it good. Bottle from Ye Old Spirit Shop in Frederick, Maryland.
Brewer's Alley Wedding Alt;Frederick, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brewer's Alley Restaurant & Brewery;Always looking for a new take on a favorite style, I was happy to try this on tap AND later in a bottle. This Alt wasn’t quite what I expected, but I liked it. A tiny bit lighter in color than your typical German Alt (slightly opaque amber--looked just like the Oktoberfest others at my table were having, though the head was a bit more tan) and the same malty freshness in the nose and in the taste. Some hops in the aftertaste--a somewhat pronounced bitterness that really rounded the flavor nicely. Excellent and very drinkable. Almost like being in Dusseldorf. Then I just found this in a bottle and tried it again. I enjoyed it even more. Same quality flavor profile, a bit darker color and a bit lighter body than I remember (both good traits) but equally good. I hope they keep bottling because I’ll keep buying. Those fancy little flip top bottles of Uerige I’ve been buying are expensive.

Papery nose, salt with sea water reminiscent of oysters. Flavor equally salty, light dough mid before a grainy wash finish, hints of honey throughout. Thin body glides over palate.

Woodstock Inn Scotch Ale;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Woodstock Inn Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Multiple tastings. I have had everything they have to offer as we come here often for dinner while in the area. As with their food, the beer is OK but nothing spectacular. In fact, most of their beers are in my opinion, sub-par. This one was just OK.
Woodstock Inn Scotch Ale;North Woodstock, New Hampshire, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Woodstock Inn Brewery;On tap @ the brewery, this was a clear, dark brown, minimal head. The aroma was sweet, fruity, with raisin, and the taste followed suit. There seemed to be too much carbonation in this one, but overall the flavor was nice.

Appears a dark brown with a red hue when held to the light. The large, off-white head fades into a mild, 1/4"" head. Tons of lace is sprayed all over the glass. Smell is malty, grainy, with hints of caramel, cocoa, and a touch of vanilla. Taste is of the mentioned aromas. Perhaps a bit of a blandness that could be a bit better but not bad. Mouthfeel is slightly unrefined but balanced for the most part with brown sugar and hop bitterness. Medium bodied with fine CO2 levels and a creaminess that comes out as it warms. This one actually gets better as it warms with mild traces of bananas and nut flavors that arise."
Swashbuckler Skull Splitter Doppelbock;Manheim, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Swashbuckler Brewing Company;This is a big beer. The nose is redolent of toasty caramel malt and the alchohol is not at all hidden. Sweet and malty throughout, this beer ends with a quick upturn of bittering hops at the very end of the swallow, offsetting what might otherwise be an unruly sweet ending. Well crafted and easily in the league of its traditional German counterpart, a the caramel aftertaste lingers long and welcome.

Great depth with abundant balancing qualities, including some nice savory elements and subdued hop characters. Thick and rich mouthfeel. Perfectly dialed in as a quintessential dessert beer, rather than something that hasn’t fully attenuated. This will be unbelievable in about 2 years, if it still exists.

Malty nose. Full-bodied, fruity and sweet malt flavours balanced off with aromatic and bitter hops with a shy herbal accent. Bitter-sweet character.

Pale, straw blond in colour (like so many of their beers), with a thin white covering for a head. As the name might suggest, the aroma and taste were of a hoppy nature, but nothing was strong enough to give it a bitter or repugnant over hopped smell or taste. OK, but moving towards bland in my eyes. In fact I had to have a bottle of Entire Stout as my second beer, just to give my senses something to do.
Hop Back Hop Fest;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Gravity cask at the Solihull CAMRA beer festival 2013. Poured a crystal clear straw colour with a bubbly white head. The aroma is stale malt. The flavour is weak bitter with a weak liqourice slightly caramel palate.

Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;***old, recently found paper review done the week that this hit the stores, Nov 2006.*** Poured out a nice mahogany brew with a 3-4mm thick creamy light tan head that never dissapears. Lots of spotty lacing. Lots of toasted malts - very strong on the malts, some fruit (plum?) to be found in the aroma. The taste is all malts as it should be, slightly sweet tasting malts, very tasty with tons of flavour. Notable alcohol burn but it’s a mouth burn only and it is short lived. The bitterness is a touch too much but totally acceptable. The finish is decent but a bit too bitter. Near to full bodied, light to no carbonation and smooth overall. A decent brew, however it has near to zero shelf life. Drink fresh!
Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Dark dark ruby red almost brown looking body and a small skiff of a cap was produced constantly being rebuilt by columns of bubbles coming up from the bottom. The aroma seems sweet and packed with caramel malts, some noticeable hops, overall this is smooth and very pleasant I’m starting to notice some alcohol in the aroma the more the beer warms. Tasty dark malts with a hint of apple juice and a touch of alcohol in the finish, the aftertaste is sweet with the roast malt character lingering for a short while. Very tasty brew crisp, clean, lots of good flavor, highly enjoyable it looks like for once Alley Kat did good.
Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours an opaque copper with a thin off-white head. Tastes of caramel and chocolate. creamy. one of the most excellent brews ever from Alley Kat.
Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;A reddish brown ale with a thin off white head. Sweet caramle malt with notes of figs, burned sugar and molasses. In mouth, a nice sweet chocolate with notes of molasses, treacle candy, alcohol warmthé A rich lingering spiceyness of cloves and burned caramle linger in mouth. Glenn, you are a good brewer! Thanks to Presario for this one.
Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Lightly hazed bright auburn color with a quick, foamy, tan head. The nose is sweet with malt, brown sugar and a bit of molasses. A hint of raisin and alcohol round out the bouquet. The body is semi-sweet with a light bitterness. Light fruit in the middle with a hint of brown sugar sweetness. This is a nice, creamy doppelbock that ends with a splash of fruit and a light bitterness.
Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;On draft at Hop N Brew - Hazy med brown color, white head. Looks tempting. Milk chocolate, bread, caramel, slightly sour nose. The mouth is a bit too sour, but the depth was great with bread, caramel, cherries, milk chocolate all dancing together. Alcohol is well hidden. The finish reminds me of a cherry chocolate milk shake Too sour overall, but getting past that, this beer is phenomenal.
Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"Bottle: rough pour puts a brilliant clear cola-red lager with a massive rocky tan cap into the bock glass. Great lacing on the glass ( lotsa protiens) Marvelous aroma: bready , herbal, musty with dried fruit and some cocoa.....pungent layered and balanced. Good solid malt spine, silky mouthfeel, medium-full body, drinkable malty character. Up front a good chew on spiced raisin bread, mid-palate the hop mixture creates some more layered flavors; herbs, nuts spice, cocoa...then the finish is excellent...this chewy malt monster dries out in a light herbal bittering and a warmth generated by the alcohol...light cocoa-bready aftertastes...like unsweetened chocolate. Overall impression: Not as rich or full bodied as some doppels but a very drinkable flavorful doppelbock...very satifying and warming, mellow but layered, malty but easy to have more than a couple...one of the best I’ve tasted from North American brewers."
Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Deep copper in colour with medium carbonation. Fairly malty aroma, with secondary notes of sweedish berries, caramel, and cola. Quite bready in the mouth with a bit of black pepper and loads of smooth munich malts. Thick mouthfeel. Perhaps not as overwhelmingly boozy as doppelbocks can be, but I liked that it was a bit on the light side for the style. Good stuff indeed!
Alley Kat Radiator;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Bock - Doppelbock;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Deep ruby copper, modest head with scant retention. Milk chocolatey aromas, a little earthy, a little pruney. A nice mouthful of flavours, including chocolate, faint coffee (that would make it mocha I guess), and some vague stewed fruit that lends a lighter touch to the overall feel. This is excellent, but not as dense or rich as the gold-standard Celebrator.
Alt Platz Sedona Bronze Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alt Platz Brewing Company;Draft: Curious raisin and yeast aroma. Greenish dark copper color with a medium head. It has a nice initial tangy punch that gives way to a pleasant moderate hoppiness. I have found that the quality of hops this brewer uses is top knotch. It’s a tad tinny, but finishes cleanly.

Alt Platz Sedona Bronze Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alt Platz Brewing Company;Tall(24oz)- purchased onsite. Was not on tap yet, but the bartender pulled me one from the cooler( Very Nice Gesture) They call it a Brozne- a hybrid brew based on the dark almost reddish brown(bronze) appearance-Excellent aroma- nicely hopped-immediate bite on the palate then a smooth rush of maltiness with a touch of sweetness- one thing I will say about this brewey is their ability to balance the beers with hop/malt tones without over powering- the beer is very pleasant and different - Unique would be the term. Once again I left happy with that all natural buzz from a great brew. Also had a pizza- and it was phenominal!!!! Dough for the pies is made onsite also- a 24oz superior beer and a great pie for less than a movie- this place floundering- I beg to differ!!!! The impertinence this brewery is getting is a disgrace- and those that are spreading it should be throttled about the head and neck reagion! Well done Alt Platz!!! Keep up the good beers!!!!!

Flossmoor Station ReplicAle Saison;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;cloudy amber appearance with a fluffy off white head. the aroma is spicy air. i caught a wheaty -banana-y flavor. not a bad beer overall, but the banana was a bit overpowering to me.
Flossmoor Station ReplicAle Saison;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Pristine polished copper color with a merging tan wrung for the head. Aromatic trepidation from the get-go, unveiling ginger, honey butter and nectar, sickingly seeping from the comb. Candi sweetness has not dried out. Unflinching, resinous sweetening is a match made in heaven for the sugar that failed to ferment. Clover. Honey over. Some cotton pricks on the palate add insult to injury as a creamed apple blend finishes the task at hand. Thanks for bringing a growler, Brigadier!
Flossmoor Station ReplicAle Saison;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"Saison #5 I attempted to consume ’blind’ at the Pewaukee tasting but the ""blind"" phase of the tasting was starting to break down. Clear, light amber color. Wonderful blended aroma of hops, yeast. Mildly sweet, some hop flavor, sourness. Lacking the barnyard edge of other Saisons sampled tonight. Perhaps not the most traditional Saison with the notable hop presence but one of the most enjoyable I have had tonight."
Flossmoor Station ReplicAle Saison;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Growler. The beer pours to a very clean amber/orange body with an ultra-thin white head. The aroma is sweet. Light brown sugar, clover, banana, and spice. The flavor is clover, light brown sugar, earthy yeasts, and star fruit. Very unique flavor. I’m digging it. The palate is moderately bodied, nicely textured, and creamy.
Flossmoor Station ReplicAle Saison;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at Flossmoor This was the first of the special releases. Since the others were either hop bombs or very dark complex beers I opted to start with the saison. I have not had enough to really decide how much I like the style but this was not a bad specialty. I might be bringing a growler to an upcoming tasting to see if other people agree. Aroma / Appearance - The hazel colored body is covered by a slight amount of head. The nose is horse blanket with a low hop profile. Underneath are some fruity notes of peach cobbler and cherries sitting by a slow burning fire. Flavor / Palate - Thick chewy molasses coats the mouth upon the first sip. As it fades in comes caramel, chocolate and a light amount of sourness. Cherry licorice greets the throat before a Robotussin finish dampens things a bit. This is definitely more of a sipping beer than anything before it and with some uniqueness that makes it stand out.
Flossmoor Station ReplicAle Saison;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at brewpub in January. Clear golden with good head. Lots of belgian yeast in taste and aroma. A bit sour. OK.

Flossmoor Station ReplicAle Saison;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;I had a butcher of this beer at Flossmoor station. I thought it was pretty good. This beer poured a handsome golden color with a slight amount of haziness and abundant head. This saison’s aroma is mild and a mix of yeastiness and biscuit aromas. The taste was more of the same, with a lot of yeastiness, some isoamly acetate (banana) notes, and abundant spiciness (although I can’t put my finger on just what it is). Quite good. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. I thought this beer was very drinkable.

John S. Rhodell Amarillo IPA;Peoria, Illinois, United States;IPA;John S. Rhodell Brewery;From the tap, served in a dimpled goblet. Poured a golden, orangey copper (maybe amber, they keep the bar area so dark it can be hard to make things out sometimes) with a foamy white head. Aromas of citrus, orange zest and lemon rinds, slightly floral with a caramel maltiness in the background. Good carbonation and a crisp, creamy smooth medium-light bodied mouthfeel. Tastes of caramel malts with some buttery toffee, amarillo hops, of course, citrusy, oranges and lemon rinds, a good IPA bitterness on the tongue, and a sour hoppy balanced by a sweet malty finish. A good, very quaffable IPA from Rhodell’s.
John S. Rhodell Amarillo IPA;Peoria, Illinois, United States;IPA;John S. Rhodell Brewery;This one hit the spot. The clear golden-copper body sports a creamy white head which emits an aroma of tart oranges, lemon zest, tangerines, and orange blossoms over a trace of the sweet malt base. In the flavor, the contast between the caramel & toffee and the hoppy bitterness is striking. They clash, but manage to merge into a satifying taste in the mouth. The prolonged bitter finish made this hophead happy. Very well done. John S. Rhodell Brewery, Peoria, IL
John S. Rhodell Belgian Gold;Peoria, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;John S. Rhodell Brewery;Interesting look for a wit, very gold body (hence the name), quite hazy, with a thick creamy head. The aroma is a skillful blending of tart oranges, wheat, corriander, a sprinle of lemon, and some mystery spices. This brew truly dances across the tongue, peppery and spicy, the corriander growing stonger. The various flavors work well together, the citrus dominating with the spices playing a strong secong, challenging for dominance as the ale warms. A very good example of the style. John S. Rhodell Brewery, Peoria, IL
Bacholdus;Moen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Alvinne;Darker blond coloured beer with some light carbonation and a short white head. Light fruity aroma. Full sprankling palate. Finish is fruity, some tart hints (grapes?) Very special.
Bacholdus;Moen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Alvinne;Bottle, bought @ Delirium, Brussels. Pale, hazy yellow-golden with a medium, fizzy, white head. Aroma has lots of sweet green grapes, light peach, some sweet malts and oranges. High carbonation, fine mouthfeel even if the spritziness does ruin it a bit. Flavour is mild, light Belgian sugar with a liqourice touch. Lots of sweetish grapes, cucumber, oranges. A hint of tartness with grape and apple peel. Quite nice, really.

Bacholdus;Moen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Alvinne;(Bottled) Hazy golden with a large, foamy and lasting head. Neutral-malty, slightly grape-vinous aroma with some honey. Quite acidic, slightly sour flavor with grapefruits pretty evident. Some fresh hops are present, but they get a bit buried under the grapes. Yeast brings more sweet fruitiness to balance the grape sourness, and after that it’s actually pretty nice. Medium-bodied, very foamy-carbonated and moderately acidic palate. A quite nice experiment from Alvinne, but not up to their better brews.
Bacholdus;Moen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Alvinne;A beer named after 2 persons Bachus god of wine and Arnoldus, Saint of the biers. A beer with 15% grapes.

Bacholdus;Moen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Alvinne;Bottle. This golden-coloured beer had a rush getting out of the bottle, so quite a bit ended up on the kitchen table. Cloudy with a lot of sediment. Cloudy. Huge, rich head. Initially sweet candy sugar aroma, but vegetables soon takes over. Quite sweet flavours, some vegetable flavours, but also hints of grape juice towards the finish. Good carbonation. Interesting experiment.
Bacholdus;Moen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Alvinne;Bottled. Unclear golden colourd. Dense white small head. Quickly diminishing. Sweetness, yeast and fruits in the aroma.

Bacholdus;Moen, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Alvinne;A Mes rate: Bottle sampled at ZBF but the thanks go to Mads for breaking out the bottle. VERY sweet stuff. I found it rather artificial and spicy. Plenty of hops in there and obvious berries but the fake sugaryness seems to mask everything. Something a little sickly in the nose. Very swift, almost vanishing blueberry finish.

Pours slightly hazy deep golden/orange/amber color with a 1 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, mango, melon, citrus peel/zest, light peppercorn, pine, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nutty, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/fairly earthy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, mango, melon, citrus peel/zest, light peppercorn, pine, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nutty, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, floral, grassy, peppery bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pear, pineapple, apricot, mango, melon, citrus peel/rind, peppercorn, pine, honey, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nutty, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/fairly earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and fairly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 8.2%. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/fairly earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, with the mellowly bitter/resinous'/drying finish; nicely soft feel, and not aggressive. Feels like Centennial/Cascade. Very juicy, vibrant, and fairly dank earthy hops; with a great balanced dark/bready malt backbone. Light residual sweetness with lingering resin dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on classic tasting Midwest style example."
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a darker golden, clear, with a white head. Juicy grapefruit and orange citrus hop aroma with pine. Flavor is juice and sticky grapefruit and pine hoppiness. Really great stuff. Something must have changed in the years since this was last rated!
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Easy to drink with food. Mild hop aroma with some pine and citrus. It had an amber color with a small head. It had an average weight mouth feel with a crispness on the finish. It wasn’t hoppy enough to fall under the India pale ale category but a pretty good blend of flavors. However, there was a harsh bitterness at the end that was a little too sharp. A decent offering.
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Black Lotus’ beers are far below average and their IPA is one their best because it is just below average...one one of the few drinkable beers they make. Update: tried this again and it look like a glass of pea soup with crud floating in it...disgusting.
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub on 7/23/11. Clear amber/copper pour with a thin off-white head. Floral hop aroma with pale and amber malts. Malty flavor with floral hops, slight pine and a grapefruit finish.
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden color with a thick white head, not too bad, the aroma is citrus and piney hops, the taste is decent but not remarkable, it doesn’t have the balance I look for in a great IPA, it’s a little one dimensional. The palate is a little thin for my liking but not bad it is at least refreshing. All in all this isn’t bad, but uninspired, they were a little safe on this one.
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear orange with a thick white head. Aroma of citrus, hop oils, and caramel malt. Flavor of citrus and floral hops -- this had a very nice hop character and was plenty hopped for an APA (that’s what it was labeled at the brewpub, although it certainly tasted more like an IPA). A solid hoppy pale ale and probably their best offering. 8/4/8/4/15 [3.9/5]
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;i’m not that experienced with IPA’s, and maybe a lot of them just taste the same to me. i thought this was drinkable. the only beer they had on tap that actually had any bite.
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Lost my notes on this one. This was, however, much better than expected. Although my tasting was at a festival, during the consumption of several beers. Alas, my scribbles are illegible, but the numbers stand
Black Lotus Detroit Hip Hops;Clawson, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Draft pint at the brewpub. Golden amber with a sudsy head. The beer is taken over by a bit of tea-leaf character, along with a flat corny malt. Not horrible, but not real good. (#3820, 1/26/2010)
Black Lotus Red Tao;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;"16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 4/9/2019. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper/amber/light reddish color with a 1 finger dense and rocky cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread dough/crust, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of nuttiness, vanilla, cocoa, peach, plum, pear, red apple, herbal, wood, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. A bit too fruity/yeasty aromas, but not overwhelming. Slight touch of diacetyl. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malts, light-moderate fruity yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread dough/crust, and toasted biscuit; with lighter notes of nuttiness, vanilla, cocoa, peach, plum, pear, red apple, herbal, wood, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Mild herbal, floral, woody, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread dough/crust, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, vanilla, cocoa, peach, plum, pear, red apple, herbal, wood, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malts, light-moderate fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky/bready/grainy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 6%. Overall this is a very nice amber ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malts, light-moderate fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with mildly bitter/drying finish, great soft feel. Very well rounded and nicely rich malt complexity, restrained fruity English yeast, and solid earthy hop presence/balance. Light residual sweetness with lingering dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and well made style example. Feels like more of an English style, but still delicious."
Black Lotus Red Tao;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a ruddy burnt amber color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head. Slowly dissipated. Sly stringy lace. The aroma had some light fruity hops, mainly sweet with a nice caramel/toffee backbone. Super light grassy hops. The flavor leaned towards the maltiness. Nice malty smooth aftertaste with the same sort of finish. The feel was between light and medium bodied with a pretty good sessionability about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt good too. Overall, good amber lager worthy of having again if I could get it.
Black Lotus Red Tao;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub on 7/23/11. Clear red pour with a medium beige head. Malty nose with dank earthy hops. Flavor starts malty with dank tobacco character before an earthy hop finish.

Aroma of caramel malt and sweet fruit. Flavor of sweet fruit (mostly apple) and lots of malty notes. Perhaps not the most exciting amber ale but it was pretty tasty and quite drinkable. 6/4/7/4/14 [3.5/5]
Black Lotus Red Tao;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;i think i can sum this beer up with a single word: bland. since when was a 5.5% amber anything but bland? it’s a boring style, and this one was extra boring.
Black Lotus Red Tao;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;This beer can be very good, on occasion, but more often it is very flat and lacks flavor and body.
Black Lotus Red Tao;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma is very light with some fruity caramel notes. It’s a transparent amber with a small off-white head. The flavor starts lightly fruity with some faint caramel. It finishes with a mild citrus hoppiness with some faint roastiness.
Black Lotus Red Tao;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;I was disappointed. Good head and Lacing with a light red color. Heavier malts and a real earthy undertone. Nothing distinctive stands out. The least enjoyable of the ones I sampled this date.
Black Lotus People Mover Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Lotus Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. There is nothing good about this beer. No aroma, weird cloudy appearence, and dirty dishwater taste - just plain nasty. Did not/could not finish this. Hard to believe that someone that owns/operates a brewpub could make beer this bad and not even be aware of it.
Black Lotus People Mover Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub on 7/23/11. Clear yellow, almost no color at all pour with a thin white head. Aroma of dank malt that’s very faint and watery. Malty and crisp flavor with a thin, dank and watery finish. Not my thing, but could be a great gateway into craft beer for the macro lager drinker.
Black Lotus People Mover Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Lotus Brewing Company;It pours a clear yellow with a not quite fizzy white head, not too bad. The aroma is grassy hops with a little caramel malts, quite boring. Taste follows the nose, not bad but uninteresting. Palate is watery and crisp. I know Black Lotus can do better, they make this beer for the sole purpose of attracting the BMC drinker.
Black Lotus People Mover Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Tap at the brewpub. Very pale straw-coloured pour. The nose is lightly grainy with a soft herbal hoppiness. Really, remarkably, incredibly bland. It’s not really bad per se, it’s just so incredibly boring.
Black Lotus People Mover Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Tap @ Black Lotus - arouma is skunky and grassy. Caramel malts, smooth. Hops are a bit offensive and dry. blah.

Aroma of sweet fruits and grainy malt. Flavor of sweet fruit and light sweet fruits (although it is not too sweet overall). Dry and drinkable. A pretty good pilsener. 6/4/7/3/13 [3.3/5]
Black Lotus People Mover Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Lotus Brewing Company;On tap at Black Lotus. Neon yellow in color.

It’s a transparent gold/yellow with a small white head. The flavor starts with some light pilsner sweetness and a hint of lemon. It finishes with some light grassy bitterness. Not a big pilsner fan, but this is pretty solid.
Black Lotus People Mover Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Black Lotus Brewing Company;While I’m not a pilsner person (too much American pilsner has made me sour on the beer), this one is ok. Light as many decent pilsners are (i.e. Bell’s).
Black Lotus Black Bottom Oatmeal Stout;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Black Lotus Brewing Company;"Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark brown color with a good finger’s worth of foamy off white head. Dissipated gently to leave some clingy stringy lace. The aroma had some sweet milk chocolate, gentle Irish coffee creamer, roasted coffee beans and some dark chocolate nibs. The flavor blended very nice between the roast and the sweet fully encasing all of the aromas together to present a very nice aftertaste (what every oatmeal stout should be going for). Quick roasty to semi-sweet and light bitter finish. The feel was medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Oatmeal helps smooth out the roast which tried to bring some abrasion to my tongue. Overall, remember in Indiana Jones movie when Belloq points to the ark of the covenant and says ""this, this is history?"" Yes, this is what I say, ""this, this is the oatmeal stout you all have been looking for. Make your own history and get this beer."
Black Lotus Black Bottom Oatmeal Stout;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. Aroma is chocolate malt, and flavor is chocolate and traces of sweet vanilla. Has a creamy mouthfeel. Pretty good.

Black Lotus Black Bottom Oatmeal Stout;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Pretty average stuff. It had the typical dark brown stout color with a tan head. The aroma was a slight roasted malts with a little bit of coffee. It had an average weight palate that was a little creamy from the oatmeal. The carbonation was a little low as this was the nitro version. Decent roasted malt flavor with a slight hop bitterness. Easy to drink but not unique.
Black Lotus Black Bottom Oatmeal Stout;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Black Lotus Brewing Company;On nitro at brewery. The pour is black with a creamy head.

Black Lotus Black Bottom Oatmeal Stout;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Pours an extremely dark brown with a tan head, looks pretty good. Smells of roasty malts, bitter chocolate and coffee pretty good but a little restrained. Taste follows the nose, it seems like it could be better again feels a bit restrained. The palate isn’t what I expected, it’s a little thin and watery, they really need to make this thicker, all in all it’s decent, but go with the imperial stout, they really went all out on that one.
Black Lotus Black Bottom Oatmeal Stout;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub on 7/23/11. Darkest brown pour with a thick tan head.

Black Lotus Lite Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Growler / Tap. Waitress mistakenly gave this instead of the requested IPA. Disappointed from the first few ounces to hit the bottom of the glass. Pours like water, looks like yellow water and tastes very bland. Bud Select may have something on this.
Black Lotus Lite Pilsner;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Wow! Very light golden color with some lacing. Nice balance of flavors that go much deeper than any light I’ve had. An amazingly thick mouthfeel. I’d actually serve this one! One of their best offerings.

James Squire Brewhouse Abbey Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Tripel;James Squire Brewhouse;This beer disappointed massively. Once upon a time there were a number of good quality squires beers. Now they have been caught up, left behind and their standards have dropped. None of the desirable Belgian qualities are there in the aroma and the only flavour on display is the 8.5% of alcohol. Disappointing again Dr Hahn.
James Squire Brewhouse Abbey Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Tripel;James Squire Brewhouse;22nd November 2009 ChrisOs Kook Tasting. Clear golden beer. Light carbonation. Sweet malt and a little fruit. Pretty authentic tasting tripel. Not bad.
James Squire Brewhouse Abbey Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Tripel;James Squire Brewhouse;Bottle at Chriso’s Kook Tasting 09. Thanks to Kook. Pale gold, cardboard. Some fruit. Bit of peach. Poorish
James Squire Brewhouse Abbey Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Tripel;James Squire Brewhouse;Once again, the encyclopedic knowledge of the waitstaff at this establishment is quite staggering. After ordering this beer I asked if they had a description of the beer. ‘Huh? Its like, uh, a Belgian beer’ (Big smile at being able to connect an abbey beer with Belgium. OK, anything else? ‘Well, what does it say on the sign around the tap (facing me)? Candy Sugar and Spice say I. ‘Oh well that’s what it is then. And its 8.05%’. Don’t you mean 8.50%?. ‘Yeah, that’s what I said.’ What about the hops used, yeast, any special malts? ‘Would you like a middy or a schooner?’ Denial of a question ever being asked being perhaps the best response in these circumstances. While writing this the beer is sitting in front of me, looking like a Duvel in its body but with only a thin crema of a head. There is a spiciness of nose but not very prominent. The mouthfeel is immediately sharp, and while clearly alcoholic, it doesn’t have the balance of a Belgian tripel, even a common one like the Leffe. I always appreciate brewers who give something different a go, even though the release of this style for a beer in the month when all other brewers are trotting out their Oktoberfestbiers is a little odd. Expectations of all brewpubs these days may be sometimes unfairly high but if the brewers hold themselves out to be premium beer producers while charging the prices they do the public has a right to expect top quality and integrity of style. I late spoke with the bar manager who was unable to give me any extra information about the beer, but that Chuck (Hahn) and Regan (Pallandi) were not giving up any information about the ingredients of the beer. Why not?
Maumee Bay Oktoberfest;Toledo, Ohio, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Maumee Bay Brewing Co.;Hah! I thought I rated this already. Bottle. Smells like a fest beer. Darker hue pale. Nice head and lots of lively co2 visible in the brew, hope it carries over to the palate. Each slug is the same, it wants to be a decent fest beer but the middle turns into an unpleasant higher alky astringent annoying kick of bitterness, quite surprising in its power. It lingers in your moth for such a long time. This gottah be way more than 30 IBU, no shit and its difficult too! Grinding gooch, gook, gringo, guido, grahzilla. Very unwanted sharply bitter finish, whew.

Sainsbury's SO Blonde Ale;Holborn, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sainsbury's;500ml bottle (Sainsbury’s) Pale gold, brief head. Weetabixy and light hoppy aroma. Some cornflakes, and sweet. Quite fizzy palate, hot harsh. Earthy taste, reasonable full light malt body, quite biting bitter noble hops. As it warms the aroma becomes more like buttered toast, and the burntness comes over more in the taste too. Has ups and downs over time - at its best its very full and tasty, at its low it’s plain and corny. Feels quite sophisticated and well made though.

Raspberry rich malt, quite a good malt aroma and flavour, raspberry fruit, dusty hop, dryish finish. Odd, some off flavours, but nice enough.
General Lafayette The Ambassador IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Thin dense head of fine bubbles and light carbonation. Nice hoppy aroma with plenty of spruce and citrus notes along with some sweet malts. Appearance is a cloudy dark mahagony brown. Nice hoppy bitterness in the flavor. Loads of spruce, caramel, roasted grains. Noticable alcohol presence. Very well balanced. Long warm finish with good bitterness and lingering maltyness. A damn good IPA. Hits all of the marks just a littlle bit weak in the aroma dept.
General Lafayette The Ambassador IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Cloudy dark amber color. Roasted hoppy nose with light floral notes. Very robust for an IPA. The taste was of roasted nuts as well as bitter hops. Full mouthful, great lacing.
General Lafayette The Ambassador IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Deep amber body with some haze and a filmy off-white head. Dank, crusty hop aroma with a toasted malt underbelly and some apparent alcohol. Grainy, toasted bread character in the flavor with moderate sweetness and assertive, lacerative bitterness. Still solid, but a previous batch seemed a little more lively, particularly in terms of hop aromatics.
General Lafayette The Ambassador IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Amber color with a medium white head. Aroma is quite malty with just enough citrus and pine. Flavor is sweet & hoppy with lots of citrus, pine, and caramel maltiness. A really nice take on an IPA - a bit maltier and sweeter, but one of the better brews GL has put out recently.
General Lafayette The Ambassador IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Brown hue, bone white lacing, bitter but not in the 90’s (IBUs,) metallic in flavor, some of the general brews are running together in my mind despite my best attempts to differentiate...So...so, there are better out there but locally still in the top 2.

General Lafayette The Ambassador IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Copper pour with aroma of caramel malt, hops, fruit.

General Lafayette The Ambassador IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Draught at Brewery: Faint hoppy aroma. Poured copper/orange in color with a big, creamy, off-white head that lasted. Cloudy and sparkling. Excellent lacing. Flavor was bitter and tasty. Notes of Simcoe hops and cream. Lightly sweet and moderatly bitter. Medium body. Short finish. Fizzy carbonation. Not as hoppy or bitter as Sly Fox or Weyerbacher Simcoe-based IPAs. Good, but not as good as its description makes it sound.
General Lafayette The Ambassador IPA;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Copper Crow Beer Company;Deep amber, creamy white head. Nose was richly hoppy with pine, earth, and hints of sweet orange marmalade. Flavor was one in the same and very bitter throughout. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, bitter finish. Very good brew and just a bit off center from your typical IPA…

Kinshihai Yuki-Kage (Snow Shadow) Junmai Tokubetsu Sake;Iizumi-shi, Niigata Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Tokubetsu;Kinshihai Shuzo;This bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a extremely small sized head of frothy medium sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body and no lacing. The strong aroma was green apple musty and mild vinous. The mildly vinous clean mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a lingering vinous aftertaste. The balanced flavor contained notes of polished rice and vinous. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.

Aroma is notes of potato, grain/rice, glue, alcohol. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic, lightly astringent. Pretty bad...typical cheap sake odors with some raw potato to boot. Not much to balance the sweetness, watery texture, and a hot/burning finish. The only thing nice about it is the bottle it comes in, sadly. Swill sake despite the price.

Rock Bottom College Park Pumpkin Ale;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Flavored - Other;Rock Bottom Indianapolis (College Park);Clear amber color with a white head. The aroma is of a mild, but noticable spice. Cloves, allspice, and other give it the expected pumpkin pie aroma, but with the strenght of others I’ve had. It left room for some of the light ale to come through in the aroma. The flavor is very much a light ale with pumpkin pie spices. Light and with a decent amount of pie spice, a little bit of sweetness and tangyness is also available. A tad too thin, but still a well crafted beer.

Arbor Cellar Select Special Reserve;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;750mL bottle, pours a dark mahogany with a small beige head. Aroma brings out vinegar, sour dark fruits, and some Worcestershire sauce. Flavour is extremely vinegary, with Worcestershire sauce, and intense vinegar. Some woodiness, but this intensely vinegary. Gets easier to drink after a while. Good stuff, but too vinegary to be drinkable in more than taster sizes.

Arbor Cellar Select Special Reserve;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Arbor Brewing Company Brewpub;750 ml bottle This 2005 vintage was shared with Travlr, BeersAndBlues2, and some others. I wish I’d opened it at home sooner. Instead of a promising sour the outcome was a mess of vinegar and fruits. I think I would rather have used the bottle as salad dressing or for cooking than rate it. Aroma / Appearance - Raspberry fluid liquid flows down the neck into the glass with a sweeping ivory head. Tart raspberries and vinegar create nothing more than a lactic bomb. If there was any depth or complexity it is long gone. Flavor / Palate - Vinegary raspberries shock the senses. Sour fruits are less lambic and more cooking vinegar. Far too sour for its own good it masks anything else that could redeem it. I’m not sure where it went wrong. Whatever the reason though if you are sitting on a bottle open it soon, drink a few ounces, and use the rest to make sorbet or flavor a salad.

Traditional Scottish Ales Ginger Explosion;Stirling, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Black Wolf Brewery;Tasted this in The Crystal Palace, Glasgow (JDW) in October 2007. Cask, handpump dispense. Crystal clear gold in colour with a thin white head. Strong aroma of ginger root and spicy cloves. Thin mouthfeel and poor lacing. Pale malt base gives a thin, weak flavour of sweet ginger and christmas spices. Hops add an astringent bitter aftertaste which marrs the whole flavour. Ginger cuts through the mishmass into the sweet but really thin finish. Lacking in depth and complexity for 5% and tastes rather weak overall. Not the best from the TSA portfolio.

Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);It has a deep amber colored body with some visible carbonation and very good clarity. On top sits a modest light tan head that hangs on well and makes some nice spotty lace on the glass. The aroma has good strong pine and citrus hops with notes of grapefruit and lemon. It has a solid, rich malty base with very solid and pleasant citrus hop notes throughout. The hop bitterness builds towards the finish and lingers a bit before it slowly fades off the tongue. It has a solid medium to full body with a smooth yet lively texture and nice carbonation.
Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);November 2009 from bottle. Mixed sampler case of Magic Hat beers. Caramel, malt, spice and fruit aromas. Good balance and flavors.
Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Backlog rating 12-16-2008 (Bottle) This beer pours a medium sized ivory fizzy head that mostly diminished, fast rising carbonation, fair amount of lacing, hazy body, and a deep orange hue with a golden tint. The Aroma is earthy, malty, some caramel, citrus, grapefruit, and pine hops. The Taste is mildly bitter, fruity and acidic. The Palate is tingly and this is a medium bodied beer. All-in-all, not a lot going on with the taste of this beer and became rather boring to drink after a short time.
Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);It’s been quite awhile since I’ve had this brew. It was very tasty with a great malt character. One of those beers you wish they wouldn’t have retired. Copper pour into the glass with a nice white head. Big malt character on the nose. Very well balanced with caramel malts really shining through on the palate. A great autumn beer.
Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Bottle shared from a friends cellar. Great looking ale with a huge rocky head, nice lacing, citrusy hop aroma. Flavor notes are plenty of hops, subtle malty sweetness in the finish.
Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Originally reviewed: 2/13/09. Pours a deep ruby color with a massive off-white head. Excellent retention and great webbing along glass edge. Smells very appealing. Great hop scent, with some grapefruit, and grassy notes as well. Every sip I take, I get a great whiff of this. Spot on. I’m really surprised at the hop bitterness this one holds. This really reminds me of Big Hoppy Monster. Some prominent bready taste in there as well. Not the most balanced as the bitterness could be a bit harsh for some. Crisp mouthfeel that aids drinkability well. Slight dry finish.
Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Good flavor with that omnipresent magic hat hops blend. Too bad its only limited edition. I hope it comes back again for more to enjoy it.
Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Deep amber with a light tan head that was gone in 60 seconds. Nose of raw green hops gives way to caramel, then diacetyl. Flavor was initially the same, but with the hop profile increasingly giving way to the caramel maltiness and diacetyl.

Magic Hat Roxy Rolles;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);From notes. Originally reviewed 12/16/2008. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a caramel / amber / cherry color, with a 4 cm white head, half of which remains and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Apricot is the strongest fruit smell in Roxy Rolles, but there are quite a few citrus odors in the mix. Definitely some caramel bread notes as well. A little bit of caramel malt up front, it is quickly followed by some nice tart, citrus flavors, with the apricot I noticed in the smell, as well as a little orange and grapefruit. Some bready flavor sneaks in, but the citrus flavors really lead into the hops nicely. The citrus slowly fades but still remains about half strength all the way until the end. The hops stay strong through the rest of the sip and I am left with a tart, bitter taste at the end. Quite enjoyable. Roxy Rolles has a medium body with a little less than medium carbonation. Although I like the citrusy and hoppy taste, I am left with somewhat of a tart aftertaste in my mouth, which is less than desirable. This is an easy-drinking amber ale. The nice caramel malt adds a smoothness throughout each sip that pulls together the citrus flavors and hops.
CooperSmiths Imperial Destroyer Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;On tap at CooperSmith’s. Black appearance with a tan head and thick lacing. Roasted malty aroma, light chocolate, bitter hops and mild dark fruits. Similar flavor with a medium to full body, a creamy feel and lingering finish. Pretty good.
CooperSmiths Imperial Destroyer Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Draft: Chocolate chestnut. Nitrogenation produces a tight, puffy beige froth which quickly settles. Unappealing nose of prunes, iron, and cream-infused caramel. Very gassy as well. Quite watery on the palate. Smoothly roasty, initially, with nutty malts and harsh notes of alcohol. Flabby bed of grains disallows any rich char to establish itself. Hints of burnt cookies, but little in the way of char. Roastiness yields a firm woody dryness along with a touch of fluffy smoke. Nougaty sweetness fails to overcome the abundance of chalky minerals. Unripe plums are overbearing at times. Earthy yeast complements the silky note of roasted barley. Finishes softly with whispers of coffee, but severely lacking in malt depth. Despite the relatively low ABV, the alcohol is rather prominent in the aroma and sharp in flavor. Obviously suffers from the use of nitrogen.

CooperSmiths Imperial Destroyer Stout;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Growler. Pours almost opaque with a thin light brown lacing.

Bouillon Airborne Biere Brune;Bouillon, Belgium;Dubbel;Brasserie de Bouillon;"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/16/2017. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep reddish orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lemon, orange, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red apple, peppercorn, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, nuts, brown bread/crust, wood, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malts, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big lemon, orange, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red apple, peppercorn, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, nuts, brown bread/crust, wood, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Moderate herbal, floral, woody, grassy bitterness; and peppery yeast spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, orange, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red apple, peppercorn, clove, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, nuts, brown bread/crust, wood, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malts, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with an awesome malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate increasing dryness from bitter/spiciness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 7.5%. Overall this is a delicious Belgian brown ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malts, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth and fairly crisp/refreshing to drink with the modestly bitter/spicy/drying finish. Well rounded Belgian yeast complexity, with a nice rich dark/Munich malt backbone, and balancing noble hops. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp dryness. A very enjoyable offering, and impressively well made style example."

Arôme a ce petit bouquet de vieille levure, malté, houblon fruité et grains bien en avant.

Le tout est épais avec une levure qui reste en avant et s’accompagne d’un malt caramel et houblon herbacé de Goldings en amertume. Ce qui ressort le plus selon moi, est le profile malté biscuité.

Marzoni's Hefeweizen;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;2007-Draft and Growler. Rating from Growler. Pours golden yellow with TONS of carbonation even after it exploded in my car on the way home. . . oops. Nice white, foamy head, quickly disapating. Hint of banana on the nose, otherwise soapy and wheat malt. Classic German Hefe taste, hint of banana and clove, but predominated by malt, a bit of skunk and then crisp hop finish, not too overpowering. A good Hefe and a decent seasonal.
Marzoni's Hefeweizen;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;On tap 10/25/07 as part of a sampler. Slightly hazy yellow, quick dying white foam, no lacing. Very slightly banana in the nose. Flavor is a bit thin, only a hint of classic hefe character and a little bit of sulfur.
Marzoni's Hefeweizen;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;On tap at Marzonis in Allison Park. A very average Hefe. Aroma was not very strong. Could pick up some yeastiness but nothing else. Pour was nice..a hazy light orange with a decent 2 finger white head. Please waitresses...I know it’s a personal preference...don’t put the orange slices in the beeer unless asked. Taste was kind of spicy and watery. If the taste carried through to the end this would be an awesome beer. It just gave up too soon.
Marzoni's Hefeweizen;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Very citrusy aroma. Lemon oil and balsamic notes. Aroma is reminiscent of Flemish sour ale, tart and woody. No banana or clove. Cloudy pale amber-gold, with thin wispy lacing white head. Medium watery body with light-medium carbonation. Starts with nice citrus and estery yeasty flavors, mild Beemans gum. Nice sweetness, followed by lemony chalky bitter finish. For a German hefeweizen, it’s a little too lemony and bitter. For a witbier, it’s perfect.

Sierra Nevada Kölsch German-Style Ale;Chico, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"355 ml bottle bought at Q-Club in SoHo, Central. Looks: Clear pale golden Half finger head with soapy white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with active carbonation.

Comments: This SN Koelsch is a good interpretation of the real thing: nice pale golden colour, well-attenuated good maltyness, spicy grassy Noble hop characters prevails in the aroma and taste with a crisp dry finish. The Loral hops here is a bit too restrained and could be a bit more expressive. Damn nice and I want more!"
Sierra Nevada Kölsch German-Style Ale;Chico, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;12oz bottle pours with a clear gold body that supports a thin white head of foam. The aroma offers up floral hop infused corn and then a faint lime note. The taste delivers an integrated blend of spicy, floral and slightly lime like hoppiness. To midway the malt base starts to surface with a bit of sweetness and corn. Decent interpretation of the style as it stays clear of becoming to sweet or heavy.
Sierra Nevada Kölsch German-Style Ale;Chico, California, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;I always like a good kolsch, and this is a good kolsch, therefore, I like it. Pale gold, small head. Nose is floral hops, bready dough, a hint of resin. Light bodied, not watery, balanced with a soft bready malt, floral hop flavors, and light-med bitterness. Lingering noble hop flavors in the aftertaste, a tad spicy and grassy (in a good way).

Karlsson Twisted Sister;Sandy, Oregon, United States;IPA;Karlsson Brewing Co.;Big alpha hops nose and taste. Sharp orange in color and with a nice swirling froth head representative of most stalwart IPAs. Fresh hop beers get no livelier. Pungent and delicious was this German tinted bold ale. Makes me look forward to next autumn!
Karlsson Twisted Sister;Sandy, Oregon, United States;IPA;Karlsson Brewing Co.;On tap at the 2006 Hood River Hops Festival. Pours orange wih a smooth white head. Very floral and green hop nose, fresh and citrusy. Flavor is sweet and has a ton of hop character, like liquid citrus hops with a lightly bitter finish.
Karlsson Twisted Sister;Sandy, Oregon, United States;IPA;Karlsson Brewing Co.;[Tastival 2006 SNOB Event – Tap] A nice fresh hopped brew. This had a ton of added Goldings and late addition magnum hops this was a truly fun to drink beer. The crowd liked this and loved the name also. The beer had some slight issue with the finish but this was not too much to take from the flavor. Good Brew.

Lucky Labrador The Mutt;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;Fresh Hop version: A lightly hazed dark amber ale with with a thin off white head.

Lucky Labrador The Mutt;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;Tap @ Green Dragon... Poured amber with an off-white head. Strong hops on the nose.

Lucky Labrador The Mutt;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;Pouring at the Oregon Fresh Hops Festival--Poured a light orange-golden-amber color with a thin, wispy white head. Nose of grassy, fruity hops and mildly sweet grains. Taste was a peculiar hoppiness with sweet maltiness in the finish. Overall, however, the finish was thin and somewhat watery. Skunky and funky as can be. Not one of my favorite fresh hop brews, but okay.
Lucky Labrador The Mutt;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;Lucky Lab and fresh hop sounded great, but I found myself not enjoying this beer and wondering why. I haven’t found many beers from the LL in the past that I haven’t liked. This beer was so light and watery, I know the subtleness was to amplify the fresh hop flavor, but the hop profile of this tasted funky, touch of cat pee. Overall the wateriness of this was overwhelming, no body, very mild wet hop sweetness. Just not what the wet hop beers are about.
Lucky Labrador The Mutt;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;Draft: Pours a cloudy orange-bronze with a thin white head. Nice fresh hop aroma with some sweet malts in there. Flavor is lightly malty and semi-bitter with a nice big floral hop finish with a hint of those oily finish as it dries crisply on the tongue. Easy drinking and good but could have used even more fresh hops.
Lucky Labrador The Mutt;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;[Tastival 2006 SNOB Event – Tap] A nice fresh hopped brew. This had a ton of different added hops. The beer was refreshing and had a malt balance with the hops that was very unique. I liked this beer a lot and loved the hops that added to the flavor. It was said it had 4 different hops used. Good stuff.
Lucky Labrador Golden Nugget;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;"Tap at the Lab in Multnomah Village. Listed as ""fresh hop Nugget IPA"". Light amber colored to deep golden. Clear. Small, fast fading white head with spotty lacing. Aroma is pleasant and fairly bright with floral notes. Medium bodied. Really bitter without becoming harsh. Lingering bitterness is a bit piney. Pretty decent, definitely a hop forward beer."
Lucky Labrador Golden Nugget;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;[Tastival 2006 SNOB Event – Tap] A nice fresh hopped brew. A nice use of the golden hops and the freshness was very exquisite. I liked the malts sued and the balance was good. The fresh hops did add to the flavor and give this beer an over the top NW hop flavor. A great beer.
Lompoc Harvest Moon;Portland, Oregon, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lompoc Brewing;Draft. A hazy amber beer with a thin beige head. The aroma is sweet with grassy notes of hops, and so is the flavor.
Lompoc Harvest Moon;Portland, Oregon, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lompoc Brewing;Enjoyed at the Hedge House in Portland, Oregon--Poured a hazy amber-copper with a small thick off-shite dome. Hoppy and sweet simultaneously. Finished astringent, dry and quite bitter. A unique beer for the autumn season.
Lompoc Harvest Moon;Portland, Oregon, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lompoc Brewing;"Draught pint at Redbones on 11/15/06. Listed as ""Harvestman Alt"" but I’m betting there’s a good chance that that was just a misinterpretation of ""Harvest moon Ale"". Regardless, I’m not creating a new entry. Heavily cloudy amber-copper colored body has an off-white head that is dense, moderately well-retained and laces the glass in rings. Plentiful carbonation rises. Hoppy, spicy nose is supremely dry, with perfume, light soap and a crunchy/earthy note from the malt. Extremely, extremely attenuated, you can tell from the nose, lending no sweetness, or perhaps, just a pinch of light toffee. Seems like some rye or other spicy/nutty grain was used, though that could very well be the hops. Medium strength of aroma, but the yeast presence in their beers always dulls it. Hops range from lightly citric, to spicy, to perfume-like and slightly floral. They collect all over the palate, lightly juicy, but with a ton of bitterness that goes overboard (for me anyways). Some soapiness on the finish, with astringent, slick, toasted malt that is all but 100% attenuated. Maybe a bit of toffee and pale malt sugar slips in, but it’s fleeting. Heavily bitter finish, very fatiguing. The highly yeasted texture is somewhat of a comfort, giving that slick, yet substantial feel. But it’s hollow, there just isnt any malt definition and the hops are 95% bitterness."
Lompoc Harvest Moon;Portland, Oregon, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lompoc Brewing;[Tastival 2006 SNOB Event – Tap] A nice fresh hopped brew. This had a interesting flavor as this was trying to be a harvest beer with over the top Hops added. Crystal hops where used and this had a flavor of an IPA meets a Oktoberfest type beer. A great try and a great cool weather beer. Good Job and nice mixing of styles.
Lompoc Crystal Missile;Portland, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lompoc Brewing;[Tastival 2006 SNOB Event – Tap] This Pilsner was anything of a old style Pils. His had fresh hops added (Crystal) and they where awesome. I liked this and a lot of great comments from others about this beer. A good use of malts and hops and the late addition of fresh hops where good stuff in my book.
Mia and Pias Fresh Hop Mug Club Madness;Klamath Falls, Oregon, United States;IPA;Mia and Pias Pizzeria and Brewhouse;[Tastival 2006 SNOB Event – Tap] This was a fun beer with a deep amber color and the fresh hops used where awesome. We could get two of the hops Cascades and Crystals the others where hard to pick out. This was a very fresh brew.
Raccoon Lodge Hop Harvest Ale;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Brewing;[Tastival 2006 SNOB Event – Tap] Another harvest ale. I wish they would say what this was supposed to be. Harvest is not a style. But this was a nice mix of the Oktoberfest style and IPA style. The hops (Cascades) where added and made this a truly great to drink beer. Deep malts and hops added to the flavors. The Amber color and nice head where also very good. This was a great beer.
Triumph American IPA;Princeton, New Jersey, United States;IPA;Triumph Brewing Company;Tasted @ the Triumph Brewing Company in Phili. Amber colored brew. Hoppy aroma. Flavor: mild, hoppy, smooth. Nice one.

Firestone Walker 10;Paso Robles, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Malty bourbon smell. Taste has notes of minerals, malt, and chocolate. Good, but not great.
Firestone Walker 10;Paso Robles, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured light brown color with an average frothy tan head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy sweet malt, wood and earth alcohol aroma. Medium to heavy body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy dark sweet flavor to medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met with a mature complex beer.
Firestone Walker 10;Paso Robles, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);22 oz bottle shared with the group. Pours a clear brown color with a small beige ring. The aroma and flavor have caramel, molasses, brown sugar, alcohol (still?), some bitterness, wood, aged fruits, oxidation is there, downhill from when I had this in 2011 but still pretty good for its age.
Firestone Walker 10;Paso Robles, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);"Bomber to snifter (shared by alexsdad06). Looks good for the style; a translucent dark hazelnut with very light beige head that steadily dissipates into bubbly lacing. Smells solid; dark fruit, oak, and toffee. Tastes like it smells with a solid mouthfeel. Some oxidization present. Still, enjoyable."
Firestone Walker 10;Paso Robles, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);22oz bottle, thanks to local raters for sharing. Labeled 12%. Mildly hazy dark brown color. Minimal ring of off-white head, dots of lace. Vinous, raisin, dark fruit aromas in the nose. Medium to bigger body, a little thinner than expected. Lightly slick texture. Some alcohol warmth, mild burn at the end, but it’s not awful. In the flavor, more roast, dark malt, stout-like flavors. Bigger bitter taste, little sweet. More dry. A little hot and intense, but pretty cool stuff. Tasting better than expected for being 7 years old or so.
Firestone Walker 10;Paso Robles, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Bottle, thnx to NorCalGrowler, shared with friends. Pours a pitch black beer with a small beige head that settles into a small ring. Looks very daunting. Aroma is madeira, port, caramel, fudge and vanilla. Some oak characters still lingering on in the background, but the port and madeira are taking over the palate in a good way. Flavor is incredibly sweet and has again a big load of madeira in there. Some bourbon and oak flavors in the background again, but you can definitely tell that this beer has age on it, and it has aged very well. Very complex and balanced and a true treat to drink this stuff. Amazing!
Firestone Walker 10;Paso Robles, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Firestone Walker Brewing (Duvel-Moortgat);Poured a clear dark brown with a reddish hue and a light frothy head. The aroma is big creamy caramel fudge roasted malt alcohol. The flavour is strong bitter with a smooth boozy alcohol bitter palate. Medium to full bodied with average carbonation and an oily texture. This is a super smooth, flavour packed whale of a beer where the higher ABV really adds to this beer which isn’t always the case. Taste it if you can and i’m sorry for you you guys that can’t.
Sudwerk Dunkel;Davis, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Sudwerk Brewing Company;Tap (sampler): Clear, copper brown, thick head and nice lace.

Sudwerk Dunkel;Davis, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Sudwerk Brewing Company;In a pint glass at the Brewery. Pours a deep reddish-brown. The head is beige and did not last long - leaving a faint rim around the edges. Nose of rich malt but light for a dunkel. Crisp, clean nutty malts on the palate. Medium mouthfeel with pronounced carbination on the finish. A light version of this style.
Sudwerk Dunkel;Davis, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Sudwerk Brewing Company;Strong fruited malt with a nice tinge of burnt. Better than other attempts of this style I have tried and well made. Good carbonation an mouth feel. Overall, nothing crazy good, but great for the style.
Sudwerk Dunkel;Davis, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Sudwerk Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Super dark red color with a creamy beige head. Light toffee, and caramel aroma. The flavor has some brown sugar, caramel, and nuttiness, with light bitterness. Light bodied with hight carbonation. At first, I had a sampler size glass of this and really liked it, but a whole mug on my second visit wasn’t nearly as good. It tasted a little weaker and not quite as fresh. Still decent and quit drinkable, but missing the richness of flavor that would demand a second mug.
Sudwerk Dunkel;Davis, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Sudwerk Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub. Strongish caramel aroma. Hazy dark brown color with a flat beige head. Near medium body with sharpish carbonation. Flavor is darkish caramel with a little noble hop. Could be a hint of chocolate. Fits the style. The finish does develop a small amount of bitter that accumulates.

Sudwerk Dunkel;Davis, California, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Sudwerk Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub last week. .3L sample. Similar roasted, cereal-like malt bill to that of the Ur-Pils that I just finished. Some spices and metallic hops notes are also present in the nose. Doesn’t really smell like a dunkel. Mildly hazy dark amber body with a smooth, small, off-white head and ok lacing. Toasted, roasted, malts to start. Becomes lightly floral and a bit hoppy with some lingering bitterness later on. Tastes a lot like the Ur-Pils I just had. Kind of funkel for a dunkel.

Gourmetbryggeriet Frosty;Roskilde, Denmark;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Gourmetbryggeriet (Harboe);A nice colored beer with persistent foam. Smells sweet and indefinable fruity (peach or apricot?).

The Tap Srybnys Pumpkin Patch Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;"Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a semi-clear orange color with a thin white foamy head. Dissipated to leave some stringy lace. The aroma had some cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin sweetness, light toast, dark bread along with some earthiness. The flavor had the spices up front, fairly bold over top of the pumpkin sweetness. Some pie spice trying to mix it all up a bit further. Aftertaste was full of the spices; the finish was the same way. The palate was between light and medium bodied with a decent sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. Spices had some harshness but weren’t too distracting, felt pleasant for the most part. Overall, good enough pumpkin ale that I could have again."

The tase is very malty, very fruity essence upfront like molasses and a hint of roasted nuts that then moves to just a small bitter hop feel for balance but finishes sweet, bready, and refreshing on the palate. This is a quality pumpkin ale one of the best I’ve had this fall.
The Tap Srybnys Pumpkin Patch Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Draft. Dark tawny brown with a quickly fading head. Roasty malt, light peat, VERY light pumpkin notes, not a thick sticky mouthfeel. Overall kind of thin and leans on the bland
The Tap Srybnys Pumpkin Patch Ale;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Tap @ The Tap. Pours a reddish mahogany with a thin head. Nose is thin but there is a distant spice going on. Typically, these pumpkin ales are more of pumpkin pie spice ale and sort of forget about the pumpkin itself. I was hopeful by the description that this would be the opposite but it was not, in fact, there was not a whole lot of spice either. On first taste, this had some bourbon notes but even that couldn’t hold this one together. Not a very good pumpkin ale.

Very diacetylic, sourish and mildly roasted-malty aroma. Roasted-malty, licoricey-salty, diacetylic flavor with a salty-roasty finish. Medium-bodied, slicky and low-carbonated palate.

Square One Pumpkin Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Square One Brewery;"Draft served in a flight at the brewpub. Pours a slightly burnt orange color with a small khaki head that settles into a ring and film and laces the glass. ""Pumpkin pie in a glass"" isn’t quite the best deScriptor here because the use of actual pumpkin makes it a little more earthy and vegetal, where others use a bigger malt backbone and more spices to make theirs bigger and sweeter. This one also has your usual slate of spices - cinnamon and nutmeg, namely - and the malts are a bit lighter but still provide enough of a satisfying backbone. It’s all in balance, too. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation. Nicely done pumpkin ale."

Les Blancs Coteaux L'Empire;Dunham, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Vignoble Les Blancs Coteaux;I’ve had this bottle for about six years and finally decided to open this at a recent tasting. Pours clear reddish brown color with no carbonation. Aromas of sweet apples and brandy. Very sweet apple flavor with brandy and a hint of booze. I was expecting a lot more alcohol flavor due to the 16.5% ABV. Thick and syrupy mouthfeel. Interesting cider.
Les Blancs Coteaux L'Empire;Dunham, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Vignoble Les Blancs Coteaux;Poura a darker amber color with a thick syrupy texture. Smells of funked out apples that have been out in the sun and have turned sour. Get some honey and tannins in there as well. Very sweet and tannic apple characters with no carbonation. Goes down pretty easy and the sourness is subtle. Kind of a funky aftertaste of rotting apple though that kind of ruined it for me. Its not great but it isnt bad. Not something I’d buy again.
Les Blancs Coteaux L'Empire;Dunham, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Vignoble Les Blancs Coteaux;500mL corked bottle. Cork is crumbly and cider is seeping through most of it. Not a good sign. Let’s see. Ugly multi brown, flat. Looks heavy. Nose of rich apple pie, oak, subtle alcohol, lots of sweetness. Flavor of very sweet apples, oak, apple-pie-like-spice, caramel, honey, small dose of tannins, alcohol in second half and finish. Sweet calvados aftertaste. Full, smooth, viscous palate. Heavy, weighty. No noticeable cork related damage. They label it an aperitif cider- too sweet for that. Maybe just a couple ounces if served before a meal. Definitely more of a dessert drink. Share with a few friends, no way I’ll finish this bottle.

Mühlfelder Stärkstes Bier der Welt;Herrsching am Ammersee, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Eisbock;Mühlfelder Brauhaus;[Munich 2018] Thanks to Jonas! 330 ml. bottle. 2005 Vintage. Apparently this needed a lot of age & it was undrinkable fresh. Dark brown amber, no head obv. Nose is extremely cloying oxidized malt syrup. Taste is insanely sweet, baffling cloying sweetness overpowers the oxidation which still lingers in the finish, alcoholic syrup, sugar, caramel, orange, cough syrup,… Great but only in very small quantities, too much cloyingness but otherwise it wouldn’t work I think.

Nur mit Hilfe von Sherry-Hefe konnte dies erreicht werden. Das Ergebnis ist allerdings alles andere als Ein Genuss, schon der Geruch erinnert an Dosenananas und damit ganz und gar nicht ab Bier. Im Mund hat man dann eine dickflüssige und sehr süße Masse, die allerdings nicht alkoholisch schmeckt, so viel ist sicher. Die Ananas ist merkwürdigerweise auch im Bier schmeckbar. Extrem süßer Nachgeschmack, der dennoch bodenständig wirkt. Keine Ähnlichkeit zu irgendeinem Bierstil erkennbar. Test vom 29.4.2007, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 8,2,3,2,11,2 - 3,20

City Steam Catholic Girls Oktoberfest;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;City Steam Brewery;"Well, I personally had the iconoclastic palate the day I met up with the other Montreal boys here. It seemed as though everything I thought was ok, they hated, and vice versa. Creamy, sweet caramel malt aroma with hints of btter and maybe brown sugar? Perhaps these are ""lactic"" aromas, but I am not so certain what lactic smells like. Coppery orange color with nice frothy off white head. This beer pulverizes me with malts. Tons of caramel, butter, and roasted notes. Mildly metallic, quite sticky. Not too shabby."

Gale's Hard Cider The Chieftans Blend;Madison, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Thomas Family Winery;Draft at the winery. Aroma is lemons, oak, spice, tartness, funk, basement, peels. Flavor is spices, tart green apples, fruits, and tartness. Extremely dry. Probably the best cider I’ve had.
Gale's Hard Cider The Chieftans Blend;Madison, Indiana, United States;Apple Cider;Thomas Family Winery;"Pale golden color, slightly hazy. Mildly carbonated. Aroma is apple wine (a combination of weak apple juice mixed with a generic white wine). Flavor is just like the aroma, starting with apple, then becoming pleasantly tart, and then moving toward a wine-like and lightly woody finish. The aftertaste is somewhat sour and acidic. My wife thinks that the finish and after taste are reminiscent of gueze or moldy cheese. Body is slightly heavier than water and the carbonation and alcohol are nearly undetectable. When I initially poured this I was careful not to distrurb the yeast cake in the bottom. After the initial glasses, I swirled up the yeast in the bottom and poured the final glass. With the yeast mixed in, the color is like pear juice. Aroma is apples with a faint amount of yeast. The flavor is more tart and more like white wine than apples. The wood/oak flavor seems to come through a little more as well. The Gales Hard Cider ""The Chieftans Blend"" has a lot more character than the regular Gales Hard Cider. The apple aroma and flavor are more pronounced and the tartness is a welcomed twist. 750 mL brown bottle (7% alcohol), $6.99 from the Thomas Family Winery."

Der Hopfen spielt hier eine größere Rolle, erkennbar ist nun, dass dieser ein leichtes Banenenaroma aufweist.

Reichenbrander Bockbier;Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Brauerei Reichenbrand;"Bottle: Reddish-amber coloured, small foamy layer; sweet-fruity (black berries) and dark-malty nose; moderate sweetish flavour, medium bodied; moderate - again - sweet-bitter finish with a touch of metal and vegetables: Not very impressive, not very tasty, but quite well drinkable, nevertheless.........."
Reichenbrander Bockbier;Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Brauerei Reichenbrand;"(bottle) Clear, mahogany colour with a medium-sized beige foamy head. Sweet, dark-malty, slightly roasted aroma with caramel and light spicy hop notes. Sweet flavour, medium bodied with a smooth carbonation. Strong malt-accented taste with caramel and dense notes of dried fruits; sweetish malty and light bitter finish. Not that convincing for a dark Bock."
Big Horn Gen X Pale Ale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);On tap @ CB and Potts Flatirons poured a clear amber with a small diminishing amber head. Aromas of carmel, toffee and toasted malt. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of malt, carmel and earthiness with a mildly bitter finish. Very drinkable but nothing special.

Central Coast Chai-P-A;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IPA;Central Coast Brewing;Seems infected to the whazoo but still very pleasant. Champagney with bubble bath foam. Touch of peppermint. Some floral aromas. Light and slightly thin but very lively body. Finishes with a bit of nut spice. Spectacular.
Central Coast Chai-P-A;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IPA;Central Coast Brewing;I had this beer at a party with some friends. I am not a Chai fan, but like IPA’s. But this beer is truly unique. Initial Chai essence, and then a well balanced and nicely bitter finish. This beer came out of a growler, so I assume it is on tap, but I’m not sure if it is available in bottles.
Central Coast Chai-P-A;San Luis Obispo, California, United States;IPA;Central Coast Brewing;Bottled straight from the tap at the brewery. Kept cold at all times and drank about 3 weeks later. Opaque reddish orange, and for a Beer capped right in front of me from the tap, the head was absolutely amazing, thick and sturdy! Green, wet and citrucy hops, with sort of an acidic, herbal twang that almost smelled like a bad perm, something I’ve detected and hated before, but this time the C hops subdued this effect just enough for me to not be turned off by it. A really interesting mix of curry spices, hops and definately some tea leaves, possibly gunpowder. I detected some tea-like tannic bitterness along with the hops, the finish had oranges and spices, caraway seeds perhaps. A really interesting Beer that surprised me when I sampled it at the brewery, and I’m glad I brought one home.
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;Couldn’t imagine I would ever ever ever have an Asahi as a celebration beer but somehow time and place determine a lot. It’s super competitive to get into public daycare in Japan and my six month old daughter just got into our second choice. We decided to take a boat to Asakusa (Asahi headquarters area) and the boat only served special Asahi beers (no Super Dry). It was a warm February afternoon and we got seat at the back of the boat where it was open. A beer was a must. Would have been better if I brought something from my house but you deal with the hand you are dealt so I had this beer. Nice malt character with lots of caramel, bread and cherry notes. Not a masterpiece by any stretch but better than I hoped and I am a happy man.
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;On tap at Asahi taproom, Asakusa. Red color, clear, big white head. Aroma of light roasted malts, caramel and faint herbal. Light body, average carbonation, decent amber lager.
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;Pours bright clear amber. Aroma is malty, sweet, bread, caramel. Taste is malty, sweet, caramel.
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;"caramel, toast, nuts, brown, light sweetness, lightly bitter, light body, thin feel, flat. Malty and toasted aroma straight out of the can, but devolves into a boozy root-beer smell as it sits. Nearly headache inducing eventually. Thin, lightly sweet. Tastes artificial, and far boozier than a 5% a.b.v. Really not feeling this, and certainly doesn’t taste ""premium"". Not particularly dunkel-like either."
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;"Can from supermarket in Kanazawa. Nose of caramel, toasted malt, and a bit of spice. Medium reddish/brown, thin tan head. Light roast malt, caramel, gentle bittering, thin sweet fruitiness, and a mild sweet finish. Thin-medium body. Okay. Would be better without the rice and starch. Shouldn’t really have ""premium"" on the label."
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;very very good dunkel style larger! clear and crisp so so clear, very drinkable.
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;On tap in the backstreets of Gion Matsuri. 300 yen for a small 500 yen for a large. I was told it was 6-7% ABV but I have no idea if that is accurate. A clear amber pour with a thick creamy beige head. The aroma is sweet grainy light caramel. Light bodied but somewhat watery. The taste is biscuit, light bready caramel goodness. Well balanced. Pretty good.
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;Bottle at Tokyo Dome Hotel. Clear amber-brown colour with a bit of head. Rather weak aroma of caramel, fruit, malt. No flavour really jumps out but there is a weak mix of caramel, dried fruit.
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;Draft (some german bar in Kyoto?). Pours a clear brown. A bigger malt flavour, drinks better than the standard Asahi.
Asahi Kohaku No Toki;Tokyo, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Asahi Breweries;Tap at the Asahi beer hall in Kyoto. Very much more a vienna or amber lager than a dunkel, but that’s what they call it. Pretty amber-red color with a very fine head. Aroma of caramel and fruit, though not very fragrant. Soft flavors of caramel, plums, cherry, plus a bit roasty in the finish. A bit of adjunct noticeable. Decent stuff for a macro.
Rock Bottom Denver Double IPA;Denver, Colorado, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Bottom Denver;On tap @ Rock Bottom Denver. Pours a hazed golden orange color with a white head. Nose is resinous pine, alcohol, and grapefruit. Lightly herbal. Some sweet caramel. Flavor is harsh resin. Bitter pine and grapefruit. Alcohol, sweet caramel, and a bit of orange.
Tarka Black Hen;Barnstaple, Devon, England;Porter;Tarka Ales;Bottle, 500ml. A dark brown/black colour with a medium-sized brown head. Aroma of bready malts, chocolate, caramel and a little sour citrus. A very malty taste with bitter chocolate and caramel. Only slightly sweet. Cocoa and the usual Tarka sour citrus in the finish. Moderate carbonation. This has echos of Youngs Double Chocolate Stout, but isn’t as sweet and doesn’t have anything added to give the chocolate flavour. Generally I find that the typical Tarka sourness present in all their brews diminishes the beer, but in Black Hen it adds an interesting extra dimension to the flavour. I’ll be sure to have this again.
B&T Aragon;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;B&T Brewery;Handpull cask at the Elm Tree. Dark gold or honey brown. Take your pick. Not quite clear.

B&T Aragon;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;B&T Brewery;[Cask at the Monks Retreat (JDW), Reading] Amber with a moderate white head. Some florals, some lemon, some caramel, but it’s all rather vague, bland and messy. A half-hearted attempt at a beer.

Hideout Lucys Lager;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;The Hideout Brewing Company;On tap at Hideout. Hazy orange-brown body, thin off-white head. Toasty aroma with grassy hops. Nutty, biscuity body, with toast and brown sugar complementing grassy, earthy hops. Fruit skin adds a sweet component. Leafy finish. Good complexity and dangerous drinkability. Resembles some brewers’ Oktoberfests, but Hideout’s Oktoberfest is a heavier, sweeter beer with greater emphasis on caramel.
Fort Street A Feather in Your Cap;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fort Street Brewery;Tap: golden yellow, 2 finger white head. Great lacing. Soft pale malt sweetness up front, faint grass and yeast. Flavor again pale malt up front, corn like sweetness through the middle, decent grass and floral finish. On par, pils aren’t my thing though.

Transparent gold with a touch of haze and a moderate white head with good retention. Sweet lager yeastiness up front with some light citrus notes. Big flowery hopped finish with a touch of citrus hops as well. With all the orange and orange peel in the aroma, it suprisingly not there much at all in the flavor.
Bouillon La Mousse du Roos;Bouillon, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie de Bouillon;"Commissioned by a rugby club. Very thick, rocky, off-white head even increasing a bit after pouring but eventually collapsing into loose ’islands’; brownish orange blonde colour, cloudy. Fruit sweetishness, herbal hoppiness, melon, pineapple, bark, earth, pepper, dill, soap, mint. Rather neutral onset with restrained fruitiness, sharpish carbonation, one-dimensional maltiness with spicy yeasty notes, peppery, dry hop bitterness in the finish.

Goose Island Special Ed;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);11/7/2008, snifter at Clybourn. Black with a dark brown edges, and a one finger beige head that faded to a ring after a few minutes. Lots of bourbon up front in the aroma, but the smoke opens up quite a bit as it warms, and comes out as smoky wood and/or campfire, not smoked meat. A fair amount of roast and chocolate is also present. Flavor still has plenty of bourbon and wood, and there’s still a fair amount of smoke, but it is a bit underwhelming. Bone dry with bitterness at a 4. Not BCS bourbony, though. Low to moderate carbonation with a full body. I prefer regular Ed, as the bourbon here is overdone--my particular batch spent nine months in the bourbon barrels.
Goose Island Special Ed;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);FoBAB 2008. Poured an opaque dark brown color with a soapy tan head. Nice aroma of vanilla, bourbon, subdued smoke, and a hint of bacon. Medium to full bodied and delicately sweet. Flavor followed the aroma with smoky bacon, chocolate, booze, and vanilla. The barrel aging was a nice addition to an already great beer.
Goose Island Special Ed;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pours brown with no head. Sinky fresh smoked nose. Not too hammy or porkish. Flavor is a bit more meaty with a bit of ash and a lot of alcohol heat. Medium easy drinking body with a long finish.
Goose Island Special Ed;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Draft at GI Clybourn. Pours dark brown, almost black with almost no head. Very noticeable carbonation. Aroma is of smoked meat, vinegar, raisiins, roasted malt, and bourbon. Heavy alcohol presence in the aroma. Taste is very heavy malt, balanced by smoky meat flavors, bourbon, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Alcohol is not hidden, but right up front in the taste. Amazingly good.
Goose Island Special Ed;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);"Tasted 4/30/08. Sample from Clybourne. My notes only said ""Ed"", so I called the brewpub and they were less than convincing that this is the beer I sampled. But, hey, here goes. Filtered with a dark brown hue with ruby highlights. Smokey nose. Good smokey nose. Full bodied and rich. Good smoke malt character. Mild effervescence and a nice hidden burn. Mild hops. Sticky and nutty with a cola note. Solid example of a smoke beer, but still not really my thing."
Goose Island Special Ed;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Dark dark brown color, off white head. Bacon, beef jerkeyesque tanned leather nose. Interesting, just a little too much towards the meat side. Flavor is something alltogether different. Beautiful chocolate and smoked malt blend together extremely well with a back end of roast to finish it off.
Goose Island Special Ed;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at Clybourn, served in snifter (too cold), Boy I was so happy to see this listed after passing on it at FoBAB: Mahogany hued with a small but lasting beige head that left some foam on the glass along with some oily legs. The aroma is powerful but not as much bourbon as I figured, some vanilla along with smoky charred oak. Also detected walnut, chocolate, caramel, rye bread, raisin, ripe cherry, and some pepper esters, NICE! The flavor start with a nice dose of sweet caramel and toffee malts, bready and vanilla too. The midsection displays a molasses and fruity twang (not sour however, again more akin to ripe sweet fruits) before leading off towards the smoked meaty and lightly spiced finish. A bit boozy but it did not get in the way and actually helped cleanse the palate. The mouth feel is sticky and oily with prickly biting towards the finish. This rocked and is without one of the better smoked beers I have had of late. Too bad I once again could not get a growler, sniff.

West St Mungo;Glasgow, Scotland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;West Brewing Co.;Nose: wet grass, melon, ice Head: medium-small, dissolves after a few minutes Eye: clear, light, medium amount of bubbles Taste: orange peel, sweet turns to bitter, aftertaste stays sweet Overall: nice refresher but after a pint it’s too sweet for me and so wouldn’t do for an all-nighter
West St Mungo;Glasgow, Scotland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;West Brewing Co.;Bottle 33 cl. Clear golden, lacing white head. Biscuity aroma. Medium body, soft and mellow malts, some cardboard. Hardly any bitterness. Quite overrated. 230719

West St Mungo;Glasgow, Scotland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;West Brewing Co.;Had on draft in Scotland. Not bad for a lager, a bit of a light scent, deep golden color, light lager taste. It’s an ok local beer but I’ll probably try something else ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Wear Valley Death By Chocolate;Bishop Auckland, Durham, England;Stout;Wear Valley Brewery;Cask conditioned at Harbury Beer Fest ’07. Dark brown with no head. Heavy coffee notes with a strong and punishing bitterness. A sharp acidity sits in the background, it is a challeging beer and not one to try often.
Wear Valley Death By Chocolate;Bishop Auckland, Durham, England;Stout;Wear Valley Brewery;Cask handpump at The Wellington, Birmingham. Black with almost no head. Some citrus and toast in the nose. Very watery. Dry finish and slightly sour. The bitterness hits you at the back of the throat, with the slight hint of dark chocolate, not before. In the front, there is nothing much more than lime and water. Despite this, it is quite rich. I agree with Doppelganger, however, that it really is not worth the name.
Wear Valley Death By Chocolate;Bishop Auckland, Durham, England;Stout;Wear Valley Brewery;Gravity, Oxford CAMRA Festival. Brown/brown with a small layer of off-white head. Burnt marshmallow and toast aroma, which actually is more pleasant than that would imply. A buttery quality add a nice softness to the aroma. Perked coffee flavor, carmel. Lighter roast and body than the aroma lead you to expect. Mineral, slightly plastic finish. For something with a name like Death by Chocolate, it seems like the chocolate is fairly minimal, and the palate is on the thin side. Not a bad stout, but doesn’t live up to it’s billing. Not a lethal dose of chocolate at all. (Shut up! You’ll be dead in a minute!)
Danish Royal Stout Ginseng;Shah Alam, Malaysia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad;Bottle. High creamy and lasting light brown head. Pitch black body. Mild coffee choccolate aroma and flavor with a good deal of hops bitterness. High carbonation. Long aftertaste. Ginseng? Sorry mates I could find no traces of it.
Danish Royal Stout Ginseng;Shah Alam, Malaysia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad;Canned in KL, Malaysia. Well I could really taste the ginseng, otherwise kind of mediocre.
Danish Royal Stout Ginseng;Shah Alam, Malaysia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad;The standalone Stout is a very good counter to all of the locally produced lagers. It has a great coffee and dark roast malty flavour that oddly works well in a climate such as in Malaysia. I had a couple the other night with some stir fried pork (yes pork in KL!) down Chinatown way. On the other hand ginseng is one of those herbal additives that are said to be good for many a common malaise. But it tastes like medicine. When added to this beer it still tastes like medicine. A shame but still erk.
Danish Royal Stout Ginseng;Shah Alam, Malaysia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad;"Can Black color; thin persistent foam layer. Mixed aroma of roasted malt and herbs, ginseng, yes. The body is medium structured, with a strong roasted malt flavor, some sourness from it, a typical ginseng bitterness; dusty. Not bad, but a FS and ginseng are two flavors that I don’t love, together they don’t make much better."

Danish Royal Stout Ginseng;Shah Alam, Malaysia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad;Bottled. A black beer with a red shine under a thick brown head. The aroma is sweet with strong notes of roasted malt as well as spicy notes of the ginseng, while the flavor is plainly sweet malty with a dry roasted end. Not my thing.
Danish Royal Stout Ginseng;Shah Alam, Malaysia;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Berhad;Deep reddish brown colour with a light brown head.

Distinct flavour and aroma of ginseng and ginger. In the aroma theres some fruits as well. Flavour is apart from the very dominant spices light roasty, light buttery and grassy. Medium bodied. Is a very weird brew, that I have problems liking.

He'Brew Monumental Jewbelation Tenth Anniversary Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shmaltz Brewing Company;"From May 2007 This pours from 22oz bottle(Brewed and bottled in Saratoga Springs, NY) a dark brown with a medium sized off-white head of foam that shrinks quickly leaving just a ring around the glass with a little lacing. The smell is pretty big. I note caramel malt, roasted malt, and an ample nose of alcohol. The taste on first sip has the caramel malt right up front and it's pretty sweet but it's joined almost immediately by some very nice roasted malt tones and some dark chocolate that stops the flavour from becoming too sweet. Nice and, boy, this is going to be a sipper for me for sure because I'm getting the alcohol kick right after the swallow and it's quite warming but the flavours of this American Strong Ale are very tasty so I'll have no problem dealing with that. ;^) Further sips in and I'm now getting some toffee and *that* just makes me smack my mouth in appreciation and...the finish starts off sweetish, turns toward the bitter side but ends up on a slightly sour note leaving a lingering and delicious aftertaste. I'm pretty impressed with how complex and diversified the flavours are but they all work together very nicely. The only ""negative"" thing I can say about it is that, for me, it's not something that I can finish at one sitting. Not a 22oz bomber. But that's okay. Bottom line: This is a pretty impressive example of the style in my book. If you haven't tried it before and see some, buy one and sip on it. PS: I'm ""capping"" the 1/2 bottle I have left and I'll sip on it some more tomorrow."
He'Brew Monumental Jewbelation Tenth Anniversary Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Bottle buried in my cellar. I know I had this fresher, but this is in front of me now. Pours a clear amber brown color with a small beige head. The aroma and flavor are caramel, toffee, ample dark fruits, a hint of orange, oxidation is noticeable, hops are long gone, decent considering the age.
He'Brew Monumental Jewbelation Tenth Anniversary Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shmaltz Brewing Company;"On tap at Champps in Brookfield. This should be the correct one ... called Monumental, and advertised as 10 hops and 10 malts. Reddish brown pour. Sweet malts and stone fruits. Thick, strong and somewhat grainy. A definite alcohol presence. And rough. Very much a stereotypical ""American Strong"". To the sweet side of bittersweet. A tough brew to drink. Too much to it to really enjoy. 13.7"
He'Brew Monumental Jewbelation Tenth Anniversary Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shmaltz Brewing Company;"I liked this one. Pretty good balance between the malts and hops. A lot more hoppy than sweet, but that is expected of this kind of ale. I wouldn’t call it a hop bomb though. This was my first introduction to the Hebrew Beer family. I tried one or two others besides this, and I would say that this was their best that I tried. Probably not a beer that will ""super-wow"" you or to beermail your buddy about, but I’d say it is worth trying. I would buy again....especially for the 10% ABV!"
He'Brew Monumental Jewbelation Tenth Anniversary Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Sweet, plum like, and dark fruit. Slight brandy like flavor. Good, but not as good as some of the later jewbelations.

Long tart and tangy fruit, toffee and booze finish. Full bodied. Excellent.
He'Brew Monumental Jewbelation Tenth Anniversary Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shmaltz Brewing Company;12oz bottle, part of the 2011 re-release, has spent at the majority of that time in the fridge. There is a little pleasant oxidation right off the bat. Aroma of dark fruits, dark caramel, dark chocolate, some vanilla and a little orange peel. Thick and chewy, but mostly balanced in the end. The dark fruit and chocolate lingers in the finish, making this a nice night cap. Warming, but not hot, alcohol.
He'Brew Monumental Jewbelation Tenth Anniversary Ale;Clifton Park, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Shmaltz Brewing Company;Another solid offering in this series of strong beers. Trippelish, lots of dark fruit, breadiness, and tons of alcohol.

I will agree this is the best beer tried from these guys.
Southport #65 Dopplebock;Southport, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Southport Brewing Company;This beer goes by many different names, but is going by the name #65 this year. Pours a brown mahogany color with a thin but persistent ring of tan bubbles. Smells of licorice, sweet malt and some cloves. As it warms, some raisins and figs show themselves. Tastes of chocolate, nuts, earthy hops, lots of spices. A grassy metallic element takes a little away from the taste, but this is otherwise a great example of this style. The alcohol on this one is well masked. By far the best beer I’ve tried from this brewer.
Brunnen Oktober Bier;Villa General Belgrano, Argentina;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Fábrica de Cerveza Brunnen;Draft - October 2006 At the brewpub in Villa General Begrano during the Oktoberfest.

Left Hand SmokeJumper Imperial Smoked Porter;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Left Hand Brewing Company;Pours black with two finger, tan head. Aroma is heavy smoke and some caramel. Taste is brown sugar and nuttiness, warming to strong smoke, roast and a touch of clove. Finish is smoky malt. A very good smoked beer.
Left Hand SmokeJumper Imperial Smoked Porter;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Left Hand Brewing Company;"I can't think of a better tribute to Colorado's smokejumpers than this beautifully balanced Imperial Porter with a smoke element. Modern brewing takes everything to extremes be that roast, alcohol, hops, sourness, or smoke. This Smoked Porter is much more reserved by comparison. Pour is just between brown and black. There's a touch of smoke on the nose, but it's barely noticeable along with the roasted malts. Flavor is slightly more smoky, but ""slightly"" is the operative word. While some of these beers go to ash try levels of smoke or have a meatiness comparable to a smokehouse, Smokejumper instead keeps it to a minimum and lets the toasted barley and herbal hops come through. There was even a bit of syrupy malty sweetness redolent of honey. Both the smokejumpers and the brewers at Left Hand deserve to have glasses raised in tribute to them."
Left Hand SmokeJumper Imperial Smoked Porter;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Left Hand Brewing Company;Bottle. A- Mild smoke, cola. A- Dark brown color, dark liquid, light brown head. T- Smoke, cola, cocoa, molasses, roasty, mild bitterness. P- Full body, average texture, average carbonation, roasty finish.

Really balanced and no umami sort of flavors.Paired very well with some potato bologna. This bottle had about 2 years of age on it.

Even though you can detect the 7.3 alcohol % in the aroma, it is hidden well in the actual tasting. The flavor is big and rich - dominated by coffee and butter. It has a smooth slick aftertaste. This brew is extremely enjoyable. Do not drink it if you are looking for bad beer. Well done brewmaster Greg on this new one!

Hakusekikan Pale Ale 2006;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Pale Ale - English;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;This beer was very different. I had Baird Pale Ale, Shiga Kogen Draft Pale Ale and then this and the scope of what a pale ale is, blew my mind. This is a deep, deep, deep mahogany color. It looks much closer to a brown ale or a dopplebock than any pale ale I have ever seen. The nose is very soft with a touch of malty buscuitiness and a touch of hops. The mouth is velvet. I have never drank a softer beer in my life. My friend said it was like something from Trent on Burton Pale Ales. I was amazed. There was a soft soapiness and a touch of toffee flavors in the softness. Mildly bitter finish. Interesting.
Birra del Borgo Christmas Ale Special 2006;Borgorose (RI), Italy;Flavored - Other;Birra del Borgo (AB InBev);From 2006 and drunk March 2008, think it would be way better if it was fresh. Hazy deep orange with a small white head. Aroma was strong spicey along with fermented mandarine (was probably fresh few years ago), the spices included cloves and pepper. Flavor was sweet/spicey and completly lacking hops i think.
Birra del Borgo Christmas Ale Special 2006;Borgorose (RI), Italy;Flavored - Other;Birra del Borgo (AB InBev);Bottled. A gusher when opened. A murky orange beer with lots of sediment floating around under a lazing tan head with small specks of sediment. The aroma is sweet with strong notes of oranges and caramel, but also a light plastic note. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of spices, caramel, and oranges, leading to a dry spicy finish, the spices include cinnamon and cloves. Drunk a month prior to the best before date - should probably have a shorter best before date on it, since I think the gushing is due to too much refermentation in the bottle.
Birra del Borgo Christmas Ale Special 2006;Borgorose (RI), Italy;Flavored - Other;Birra del Borgo (AB InBev);It’s a vintage 2006 and I had it January 2008. Red-golden and hazy with a huge, nice head. The aroma has notes of Christmas spices, orange, malt, caramel and sweetness. The mouthfeel is annoying, the carbonation makes it very fizzy. The flavour has a slightly bitter grapefruit note, a light sweetness, spices, old (OK meant) orange peal, slightly sour malt and grapefruit in the finish. IMO the balance could have been better.

Well-done strong brown belgian, comparable to some quadrupels I had but without the magnificience...

Nothing seems wrong but nothing is overwhelming neither.
The Tap Blood Of 1000 Corpses;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;EBF 2007 - had to try this one, both for the name and the unique recipe - reddish purple pour, with minimal head - very earthy, vegetable aroma, though not specifically of beets - the beets are there in the flavor, though, along with notes of other root veggies, like taro and parsnip - moderate sweetness ads on almost fruity aspect to the otherwise heavy vegetable flavor - I’m not a big fan of beet, and because they’re so apparent I didn’t enjoy this as much as I could have, but I have to give them credit for making something so unique.
The Tap Blood Of 1000 Corpses;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Draft at The Tap. This was an odd one-I applaud the brewers at The Tap (and everywhere, for that matter) for having the guts to brew using very unorthodox ingredients. Unfortunately, for every successful experiment there are many failures. This one is most defiantly not going to be produced for mass consumption, but it was fun to try! Body is red like cranberry juice, nose is sweet and beety. Taste is exactly what you would expect-beets and malt sweetness. The beet flavor was not too much, like I had anticipated. A fun beer to try, but I don’t believe I would ever have it again. Once again, I tip my hat to the brewer who was creative enough to attempt this beer.
The Tap Blood Of 1000 Corpses;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Tap @ The Tap. Pours an incredible lighter red, not exactly blood, but pretty cool. Nose is sweet and fruity. Flavors are a light raspberry/cranberry,smidge of sweetness and quite good. No way you notice that this one is 8%. Nor can you taste the presence of beets, just their residual sugar. The alcohol is very well hidden. Be careful with this one, although this blood is everyones type, too many may raise the levels of blood fairly high but check it out!

Clockwork Hazy Daze Bramble;Glasgow, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Clockwork Beer Co.(Maclay);Aroma started really fruity, berry sweetness but as it warmed it seemed to loose everything it had to offer. Taste was similar with more of a toffee malt character acting throughout it.

Northumberland);Aroma gives pale malts and grassy hops, biscuts come through towards the end. Taste is similar with the grassy hops giviong a good amount of bitterness, yet not a very dry finish.
Rochester Mills Christmas In July;Rochester, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Rochester Mills Beer Company;Pours a murky brown color with a thin beige head.

The strong aroma was spicy and heralb. The mouth feel was very tingly at the start and at the finish with a spicy aftertaste. The strong flavor contained notes of malt cinnamon nutmeg, strong herbal spices and many more. A decent complex one with an excellent aroma but not one that I would consider drinking again.

Felstar Wheat;Dunmow, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Felstar;From cask. Pours cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma is mild estery. wheaty and slight fruity. Fruity and malty flavoured. Sweet and slight bitter, Dry and hoppy grassy to hayish into the finish. Mild estery touch.
Felstar Wheat;Dunmow, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Felstar;Bottle conditioned, 500ml. Greenish gold with stable white head. Clearer beer than expected and certainly not a standard wheat beer. There is a hint of banana in the flavour and a citric lemon note, but all very much understated. Fruity bright finish but slightly flabby. Reasonable.
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Pours Golden with a thin white head. Heavy carbonation. Taste is unremarkable, no noticeable or notable influences. Palate is similarly weak. Drinkable not a good beer
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);"Tap, Bohemian Hall, Queens, 17/12/11. Burnished orange; light haze, slim lid. Light apricot/dried fruit nose, a litttle candy. Grassy and anonymous. Tickle of citrus and candy cigs. Not a Golden Ale, just a lager in my book, but then I’m from England where the style can outhop a US DIPA. Not bad, just bland. Gave up and had the Oatmeal Stout instead."
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Unpleasant color, overly hoppy brew. I am not an IPA fan, and this wasn’t up my alley. Not an IPA but seemed much the same to me.
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);On tap at a local beer store. Overall it is sweet, the style really doesn’t come through, too fruity for a blond. Has a citrus taste, heavy wheat, but some taste of flour or bread hops....not sure. Decent co2, not well balanced. It is drinkable, not one I would seek out, but I would drink this again.
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);355 ml bottle in New York. Amber color, little head. Fake citrus aroma. Hoppy unnatrual sweet sticky taste. Palate is hoppy. This is the typical Ice Cream flavored brewery stuff. Not good. As with many breweries here they try to make many beers unable to perfect any.
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);tap from tasting room- pours yellow, tastes oddly smokey/toasty- maybe some of the toasted lager in this one. Not that good.
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Pours golden, like the name. Aroma of some light floral scents. Flavor strongly of wheat. It is almost as if it is a fruit beer that is simply waiting for the right fruit to come along. Rather sweet either way.
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);on tap-pours a white head with yellow color. Aroma is grain, musty-funky. Taste follows with some hops. OK carbonation.
Blue Point Golden Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Sample at the brewery tasting room. A rather unattractive yellow color with a thick head. Has a deceptively medicinal and herbal aroma. However, all this leads to a surprising and deliciously sweet malt flavor. Slightly biscuit-y a la a British bitter mixed some strong sweet malts. Mouthfeel has a perfect level of felt carbonation. A surprising delight. 6/2/8/4/15Rerate: definitely a different batch and a very different beer. Not so unattractive yellow anymore. Taste is a lot more hoppy (some citrus some herbal hops) and less on the biscuit. Still very quaffable though. 7//3/7/3/15.
Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wood IPA;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;On tap at the brewery, pours a hazy, dark gold with some lacing, white head. Nose has an odd soap note, very industrial, some stale bread. Flavor of lemon and soap, honey, some tea. Watery finish. A big mess.
Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wood IPA;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Tap at the brewery. Pours fairly clear orange copper. Some lacing. Some overripe pineapple and grapefruit in the flavor. Not sure what to make of this IPA.
Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wood IPA;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;On tap at brewpub, pours a clear light amber with a thin soapy head and spotty lacing, the aroma has a slight hop touch to it but there isn’t much there, the flavor has a light hop front end with a malty finish, pretty middle of the road ipa.
Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wood IPA;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Solid brewpub IPA. Big, bold, balanced. Golden tan, rich. Toasty golden malt tones. OK.
Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wood IPA;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Draught pint at the brewpub, mid-October 2006. Amber-bronze colored, very clear with just a smidgeon of white head but nice lacing....faint aroma offers wafts of tart apples and cherries, muted pine sap, but it all blows away before you can enjoy it....malty and relatively sweet on the tongue, very light pungent hoppy notes, somewhat thin, earthy and moderately bitter at the finish, tingly carbonation. Ehhh.
Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wood IPA;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;Draught at the brewpub. Clear light orange color with thin white head that laced the glass. Aroma and flavor of grapefruity hops with plenty of hop bitterness. Nice IPA.
Grumpy Troll Norwegian Wood IPA;Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;The body was dark gold with a white colored head on top. The aroma was grapefruit with some dish soap. There was also a little bit of bread crust. The taste was bitter bread crust with some spice of black pepper. There was also a little bit of toffee. A decent IPA.
Lost Duck Oktoberfest;Fort Madison, Iowa, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Lost Duck Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Hazy red-orange color with thick off white head that laced the glass. Spicy aroma with light brown sugar and subdued sprucy hops. Dry on the tongue with flavors of dried fruit, brown sugar, and a touch of raspberry. Decent oktoberfest.
Ragtime Tavern Oktoberfest;Atlantic Beach, Florida, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ragtime Tavern (Craftworks);10/8/12. On tap at the brewpub... apparently they’re still making this! Clear red pour with a small khaki head. Sweet, malty aroma with biscuits and a touch of toast. Sweet, malty flavor as well, again with biscuits and toast, with touches of caramel and barely a hint of chocolate. Eh.
Ragtime Tavern Oktoberfest;Atlantic Beach, Florida, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ragtime Tavern (Craftworks);On tap at the brewpub. Light copper with a small beige head. Foul nose and flavor - something went wrong here. Skunky, sourish malt and no hop presence. Awful.
Ragtime Tavern Oktoberfest;Atlantic Beach, Florida, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Ragtime Tavern (Craftworks);Draft at brewpub. Poured a clear copper color with an average fizzy off-white head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Good roasted sweet malt aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture. Good well balanced flavor of malt and a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good brew.
Barleys Irma IPA;Greenville, South Carolina, United States;IPA;Thomas Creek Brewery;Draught at Greenville Barley’s. Bronze pour with a well sculpted white head. There’s assertive juicy grapefruit and caramel in the nose with fainter notes of grass and pine. I’m surprised to find such a clean and well balanced beer given my other forays into this brewery’s products. There is a nice level of honey, sweetened green tea, grapefruit. The finish is drying and biting with just a medium level of aggression. No real complaints.
Dominion Hop Harvest Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On cask at Max’s, Baltimore. Strange to see how long it’s been since there were any ratings of this, but this is how the beer was clearly designated on the list at Max’s. Heavy amber pour with a thick creamy head, and a pungent nose of both bright hops and some added spice. Herbal and grassy notes tend to complement the modest autumnal spice that comes through, and the thick body seems appropriate although clean and easy-drinking.
Dominion Hop Harvest Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);Clear amber body with off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, grapefruit, some caramel. Taste is medium sweet, grapefruit, some caramel, light bread. Light-medium body, light stickiness.
Dominion Hop Harvest Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);To start with I expected a lot from this brew and was left wanting. Lightly hazed amber-copper body. The aroma took a while to come out as it was served VERY cold! It really lacked the big citrus burst I have come to expect from a wet hop ale. More herbal than fruity to me. In fact the whold experience was very ESBish. A good dose of biscuit malt flavor keeps things interesting but teh hops are subdued throughout. In the end a decent beer but it does not live up the expectations that I had. Oh well.
Dominion Hop Harvest Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Enjoyed this one on draught at the brewpub in Ashburn, VA, and a 2 liter swing top growler to take home on 10/23/06. Hop Havest, ""fresh"" hop, or ""wet"" hop ales have been done for a while, by West Coast breweries. This beer is brewed with fresh hops, just hours off the vines. Many hop heads and beer geeks are surprised and dissapointed, that these beers are not hop blasts with tons of hop aroma and bitterness. If that is what you are expecting, then you will be dissapointed. Wet hop ales, allow you the experience to enjoy the aroma, and flavor of young, fresh, hops. In Dominion’s case it is fresh Centennials and Cascades grown in NY. This beer pours to a hazy, amber color, with a nice white head that fades, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is pleasing, with gentle aromas of fresh hops, fresh bread, and biscuity malt. The palate is firm, with good carmel and biscuit malt flavors, paired with a very pleasing citrus hop flavor. This beer finishes with more good pale and carmel malt up front, then ends with a pleasing, gentle citrus hop bittereness that lingers. Well done, very tasty wet hop ale. You really get very enjoyable citrus/bitter hop flavor in this beer, but it is by no means a hop blast, but it isn’t meant to be. Worth a try to see what fresh hops, hours of the vines are like in a beer."
Dominion Hop Harvest Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);On tap at Dominion 10/20/06. Was very much looking forward to this. Unfiltered, somewhat hazy amber with a white head that which thins out but lasts for the most part. Has a floral PacNW hop aroma but nothing that really stands out or blows you away. Flavor has notes of caramel, pine, grapefruit/citrus. Moderately sweet with a good hop presence which actually isn’t all that bitter. It could use some more malty heft as the taste ends a little watery. Medium bodied with a smooth texture and moderate carbonation. Overall, a solid, well-hopped American Pale Ale. But, I have to admit, it was disappointing - in fact, I brought my growler for this and didn’t even fill it up after dinner. Nothing about it really stands out as being from a fresh hop harvest - just kind of normal to me.
Dominion Hop Harvest Ale;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Old Dominion Brewing Company (AB InBev);"Draft... Murky amber ale with a small, wispy, white head. The nose delivers subtle notes of black tea, toffee, biscuity malt and very light grapefruit. Perfect balance is the only way to describe the flavor. Fresh, bitter lupulin countered by sweet, breadsy yeast and malt. Medium-bodied with a milky mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Crisp finish with only a whisper of bitterness. Refreshing, quality beer. Certainly not good enough to keep me from ordering a ""brewpub version"" Oak Barrel Stout as my second pint of the night. Good American Pale Ale or English IPA... or as jeffc666 mentions, it could just as easily be classified as a Bitter."
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Draft at Rattle with Npodendorf. Pours deep brown with a beige head. Wheaty base, with some light sweetness, very light fruity notes, and low bitterness. Comes up just a bit short, but enjoyable nonetheless.
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;"Poured draugh at Rattle N Hum in NYC. Pours very dark, cloudy brown color. There isn’t much aroma to this beer; a slightly sweet smell but nothing notable. There is a mild taste without anything standing out. No banana/colve notes as is typical is many dunkleweiss and hefeweiss beers. Not memorable."
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Sampled at 4th NoVA Summer Brewfest. Pours hazy brown with a small, fizzy white head, no retention or lacing. Aroma is heavy malt (caramel, toast, bread), average hops (floral, citrus), and light esters (apple/pear). Flavor is malt with some hop bitterness. Light body and warmth, medium carbonation and a dry finish.
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Copper color, white head some lacing. Cereal and some hops greet my nostrils. A light to medium body and good wheat flavor and some earthiness. Overall an easy drinking wheat.
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Poured into a weizen glass. Thanks to thagr81us for this. 4.0 A: This is the third RJR brew I’ve had recently and surprisingly this (a wheat ale) has the least amount of carbonation. Hazy yellow-orange color. Two and a half fingers of frothy white head. Average retention and moderate lacing. 3.5 S: Neutral wheat with musky cellar funkiness. Not really anything else going on, but not too bad. 3.0 T: Low in flavor. The strongest flavor is a mild hop bitterness. Neutral wheat, musty funkiness again, and yeasty. Not really any spiciness. 2.5 M: Lighter body. Carbonation is high, but within the style. Not creamy at all like a good wheat and leaves a chalky aftertaste. 2.5 D: I’m not a big fan of this brewery. Nothing really good about this brew. Serving type: bottle Reviewed on: 08-14-2010 03:29:28
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;A straightforward clean tasting dark American style wheat. Not a bad beer, just not a whole lot to it. The finish is the best part, it is mostly malty with a bit of nuttiness.
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith Euro pint. Pours a yellow-orange with white one-finger head that quickly subsides to a minimal amount. There was no apparent lacing present. The aroma was comprised of only malt and wheat. The flavor was of citrus and wheat. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this brew kind of lacks robust flavoring to be good. It is not bad however, and would be an awesome lawnmower beer as it is quite smooth and drinkable.
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;Pours a barely transparent hazy golden yellow with a decent white head. Aroma is wheaty, yeasty and just a little lemony, about average for this style. Mouth filling flavor is crisp and wheaty with a nice undertone of citrus, mainly lemon, a little bit of summer sunshine. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy.
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;12oz bottle. juicy, peachy pear aroma. hazy orange under a very large rocky cream colored head. the fruity pear continues into he flavor with a soft honey toffee flavor. light body. a pretty tasty wheat ale.
R.J. Rockers Buckwheat;Spartanburg, South Carolina, United States;Wheat Ale;R.J. Rockers Brewing Co.;This is why I don’t like hefe weizens. It’s hard to pull off a great hefe. They didn’t get it right here. Drank it from the bottle. Slight hint of mystery fruit. Overwhelming yeasty taste. One of six on my SC trip. Nov 09

Zarracina;Porceyo, Gijon, Asturias, Spain;Apple Cider;Industrial Zarracina, S. A.;250ml bottle from a corner shop in Málaga. Pours clear yellow gold with no real head. Aromas of sour apple, tart. Taste has a light sweetness though. Back-sweetened I'd guess. Worth the €1.75 I suppose.
Zarracina;Porceyo, Gijon, Asturias, Spain;Apple Cider;Industrial Zarracina, S. A.;Color dorado amarillento, translúcido, con capa de espuma blanca de un dedo de grosor y escasa retención. Carbonatación alta visualmente. Textura acuosa y efervescente. Aroma manzana, piel de manzana, manzana ácida, cuero. Sabor a manzana, con buena dosis de piel de manzana ácida. Básicamente dulce, pero con ligera acidez durante todo el trago, lo cual hace que no sea empalagosa. Final dulce. Postgusto a manzana dulce.
Zarracina;Porceyo, Gijon, Asturias, Spain;Apple Cider;Industrial Zarracina, S. A.;Bottle from a supermarket in Benasque. Clear golden color with white head that goes down quickly. Aroma is apples, vanilla custard, a tiny touch of funk. Taste is apples, vanilla, sweet. Medium carbonation. Too sweet for me, but okay.

Zarracina;Porceyo, Gijon, Asturias, Spain;Apple Cider;Industrial Zarracina, S. A.;Bottled, 70cl with champagne-corking. Vauw, what a surprise, a nice cider, and it is Spanish, I wasn’t aware of that tradition. It was very nice to find something else than the thin, pale lagers available on Tenerife. It pours clear, a bit sparkling, pale yellow. It has a distinct aroma of apples, and some yeast, sourness, dust and cellar. Yellow apples, sourness, yeast and cellar in the flavor. Medium, sparkling mouthfeel, but it lacks some astringency to finish it off, it’s only apples and some cellar. A nice one. (070210)
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;16 oz. can from Craft Beer Cellar-Clayton. Pours a clear orange color with a small off-white head that settles into a ring and wispy film. Big pumpkin character, obviously, but more than expected, and it hits both pie and vegetal receptors. Vanilla, nutmeg, clove, graham cracker, leaves, and a dash of cinnamon. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, mildly spicy mouthfeel. Not a category beater or anything, but a solid pumpkin ale that bested expectations.
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a coppery color with a small head. Aroma of grain with a bit of spice. Taste of a light malt sweetness with just a wee bit of pumpkin and spice. Mild bitterness and a fairly clean finish. Light body, smooth but not much in the way of pumpkin and spice. Fairly ho-hum pumpkin beer.
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;"Just meh. Barely any pumpkin flavor when it should be bursting with it. Tasted at Kansas City Beerfest at Union Station October, 2015. I had so many that this rating might be a bit off. ;)"
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Tap - small foamy head, medium Amber color, well balanced moderate pumpkin and spice aroma and flavor, not overpowering but definitely enough to know its there, not a bad pumpkin beer overall ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Aroma is spices, malts and mild pumpkin bread. The flavor is spices, mild pumpkin and a mix of slight funk and sweetness in the finish.
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Good balance of flavor between the pumpkin and the spices. Nice blend of sweetness and bite. It was crisp, sharp and smooth. A light to medium bodied ale
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Pour is a cloudy orange-ish with a small white head. Aroma is full on pumpkin pie spices. Flavor is again a real nice pumpkin pie spice and you can almost taste some crust in there. Finish leaves a nice spice on the tongue. Lots of cinnamon in this. This may be a bit thinner than some other pumpkin ales but its quite tasty and lower in alcohol than most.
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;"Aroma is definitely a malt beverage, not a beer. I’m getting some pumpkin pie spice and vanilla, but it’s all muted and weak. Looks nice; amber reddish color with a small amount of white foam. The taste is truly like pumpkin pie. They even got he crust and the whipped cream right. A dessert beer for sure, but the taste delivers what it promises. If you are wanting pumpkin pie in a 16 oz can, this beer is for you."
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;2013. Yep another pumpkin beer...yawn. it’s ok, but schlaflys is still the gold standard for pumpkin beers. I wish this one had more alcohol.
Kirkwood Station Pumpkin Ale;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Sample at Augusta Bottoms Fest 2011. Bring on fall and bring on the Pumpkin Beers! This one poured a darker amber, orange color. Aroma was cinnamon, nutmeg and spices. Flavor was cookie, nutmeg, and some vanilla coming though. Finish is were the pumpkin flavors really hit you. Great pumpkin beer.

Alandale Vienna Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;(draught at the brewpub) light-medium amber. Moderate head with a little lace. Mild malt aroma. Flavor is malt, a bit of hops, not sweet. A good session beer.
Alandale Vienna Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;This was not a good example of style. It was slightly hay-like. It had a very grainy taste, like vyvvy said. I just think it was not very well made. A decent mild hop and smooth beer, just not very good overall.
Alandale Vienna Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Very light pale yellow with a smallish white head. Aroma has lightly sweet malt with light mustiness and some graininess. The aroma is very clean. Medium body with light carbonation. Taste has grainy malt that turns more smooth and sweetness starts to trickle in along with some fruitiness. The finish gets more crisp and adds a bit of spicy hops. Pretty nice.

Pours a clear amber color with a small eggshell white head. The aroma has caramel malts, toast, nuts, raisins, and minerals. Flavor of sweet caramel malts, toffee, toasted brown sugar, nuts, and some dry fruits. Light-medium bodied, with a sweet, malty mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. So-so doppelbock, a little light, with a nose that is hurt by the mineral presence.
Kirkwood Station Dopplebock Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;On tap at Highlands brewpub. Orange-amber with a thin white head. Aroma of toffee, malt, corn, alcohol and mild dark fruit. Malt bomb has flavors of toffee, mild fruit and caramel. One of their better offerings.
Kirkwood Station Dopplebock Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Pours a dark brown orange. Nice rich malty aroma. Nice thick mouthfeel and lots of malt and caramel flavor that hides it s strength well.
Kirkwood Station Dopplebock Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;"On tap at Heritage Brew Fest 2008. Pours a light amber in color with a a smooth thin but lingering white head. A rich malty dopple but a little on the thin/sweet side. Very good and refreshing w/o much alcohol presence in spite of the 8.1 ABV and smoothly malty. Very deceiving; don’t drink too many unless you’re ready."
Kirkwood Station Dopplebock Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub. Alandale’s version of the style is a mostly clear dark orange/copper color with a medium light beige head that diminishes steadily. Short strings of lacing. Malty nose with some alcohol and dark fruit in the background. Medium and syrupy body with a strong malt profile. Notes of caramel and grain flavors are present as well. Light hops saves it from becoming cloying. The finish is malty and sweet, leaving a grainy malt aftertaste. Above average overall.
Kirkwood Station Dopplebock Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;12 oz. draft. They like to push this when they sense you’re a beer lover, and I can see why. This has a color between pils gold and copper. Smell shows caramel cremes and Bit-o-Honey. Now I’ve been sucking cough drops all day, so I may be tasting this as sweeter than it really is. But there are heavy malts approaching syrup quality. Alcohol is smooth and warming on a cool afternoon. Good sippin’ beer.
Kirkwood Station Dopplebock Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Draft 12 oz’er at the brewpub. Deep amber color with a sticky tan head. Not much to the aroma, but this has a gargantuan malty powerhouse of a flavor. Rich and sugary, maybe a bit too much for a hot July day. Quite good. (#3029, 7/17/2007)
Kirkwood Station Dopplebock Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;"(draught at the brewpub) medium-dark amber with moderate head, nice lace. Mild malt aroma. Flavor is sweet malt, body is reasonably thick; noticeable hops in the finish, metallic aftertaste."
Kirkwood Station Dopplebock Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Again, what is with these weak beers? The malting on the dopplebock was very sub-standard. There was no complexity to brew. A slight caramel, sour, metallic flavor with a hint of sherry. Just a poor effort.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Lovely little harmony between stout & fall! Pours black w/ a mocha head & lots of lacing. The aroma is dominated by the pumpkin & fall spices. The flavor is more roasty w/ the cinnamon & nutmeg more as complimentary parts. The body is a touch thin surprisingly but allows the beer to go down easy! Delightful!
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;"Deep super dark brown coloured body with a thinnish, single centimetre tall tan head that fades very fast. Aroma of squash, light spices, licorice, molasses, alcohol, earth, hazlenuts and a good deal of caramelised sugars. Medium to Full-bodied; Strong rich earthy and malty flavour with a good bit of squash, anise, molasses, raisins, figs and a peat-y flavour that shows well near the end. Aftertaste is rich with complexity showing the sugars, spices, body (from the squash) and pungent near the end, from the alcohol. Overall, a rich and exciting beer - just about perfect for the style and the name - it’s exactly what you’d expect to be getting, and done in a can - very nice! I sampled this twelve ounce can purchased from Whole Foods in New York (Bowery), New York on 27-May-2016 for US$2,99 sampled at home in Washington on Halloween, 31-October-2016 after just trick-or-treating with my daughters."
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;It’s no pumpkinator but it’s pretty darn tasty. Pumpkin, pie spices, molasses, bittersweet chocolate. What’s not to like?
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Draught from maddy dc. Brownish pour. Pumpkin cinnamon. Malts and pretty good stuff .
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;12 oz. can. Black with a medium khaki head. Smell is milk chocolat and pumpkin. Comes off a little weird. Cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste is better. More roasty. Pumpkin behind it. Nutmeg and cinnamon spice linger in the back end. Still has a bit of weirdness. Medium body. Well carbonated. It’s just a little bit off-putting. No sure what it is, though.

Has a roasted malty spicy caramel pumpkin aroma. Roasted malty spicy pumpkin and chocolate flavor. Has a roasted malty spicy pumpkin and chocolate finish.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Pours an inky almost black with a healthy, dense light brown head which lingers......aroma is pumpkin, molasses, slight chocolate.....taste is excellent! very smooth taste of coffee, a touch of pumpkin, the spices seem to be drowned out by the bittering coffee ground finish. Quite enjoyable, just begging for a bourbon barrel finish.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Silver can at America on Tap Deep brown bordering on black. Rich chocolate and roast with some brown sugary sweetness and just enough pumpkin pie character to let you know this one is a little different. Enjoyed!
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Pint on tap. Ebony but uncloudy body has a thin creamy disc of bubbles on top. Nose of earthy pumpkin, cocoa and spices. Tastes of dark chocolate, pumpkin and nutmeg. Medium body is well balanced and has a smooth medium carbonation.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Pumpkin Stout;Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Stout;Cape Ann Brewing Company;1 centimeter of fine, tan head which fades in 30 seconds to a ring. Black with glints of brown-red at the very edges. Aroma of pumpkin pie and a bit of roast (burnt coffee, toast.) Some dark coco. Body is watery, moderate, fat carbonation with little-to-medium burn. Lots of pumpkin, some nutmeg, general spice, mild coco. Dusty grain. Overall, a neat pumpkin stout, but disappointing in that it lacks the richness and body of a satisfying stout of any sort (unless your into more of a weak Irish variety.) I wish it went all the way, my palate is aching for more intensity.

Rock Bottom Yorktown Abbey Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;As the renowned Dr*nk rater before me has noted, this is much more of a quaffable blond than it is a strong ale. Nice looking pour, a slightly hazy yellow body with constant bubbling, albeit coupled with a slender white head. The nose presents some soft malts, a touch of the citric, and a suggestion of sweet cherries. Sweet and lightly fruity with a quick, mildly tart finish, this is an ale one could enjoy all night long without the fear of getting totally snuckered. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL
Rock Bottom Yorktown Abbey Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;"Mug Club Draft. Despite the name, this seems to fall into the purview of a Belgian Blond Ale, too light to be an Abbey Dubbel. Cloudy yellow to brown pour in my mug, with a bubbly but thin head. Clean pale malt smell. First taste impression is of oranges, followed by a healthy dose of those light Belgian malts. And agreeable fruity ale component. Hops come on like the bratty little brother of a La Chouffe: one moment spicy and grassy; the next running back home to ma. Substantial and worth contemplation. Finish turns slightly hoppier and lemony. Another surprise from Chris Boggess’ recipe book."
City Steam Prom Queen IPA;Hartford, Connecticut, United States;IPA;City Steam Brewery;pours a white head with yellow color. Aroma is bold light/medium citrus hops-grapefruit. Taste follows with some bite, hint of malt. Finish highlights the raw hops and light/medium body of this nice beer. Good carbonation.
Etienne Dupont Givre (~7%);Victot-Pontfol, France;Apple Cider-Ice/Fire/Fortified;Domaine Famille Dupont;Bottle at home. Pours clear tawny and still.

Aroma is sweet super ripe apple or maybe even somewhat sugary. Flavor also has super ripe apple as well as light sugary notes. Quite pleasant.
Rock Bottom Des Moines Pumpkin Ale;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Rock Bottom Des Moines;State week month, week 2 Oct 9th - 15th. State: Iowa. Pours a deep orange with a medium head and good lace. The aroma is pretty well dominated with rich pumpkin pie spice, there is a subdued fruitiness and a mild soapiness in there as well. The flavor is very centered around pie-spice (allspice, cinnamon, etc). The beer is moderaltly sweet and has what I precieve as a yeast driven clove character, but who knows... it could just be from some cloves.
Rock Bottom Des Moines Pumpkin Ale;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Rock Bottom Des Moines;Hazy brown body with a little hint of copper. There is a thin white head. The nose is massive pumkin and a little nutmeg. There is also cinnamon and a little caramel. The taste is like raw pumpkin with a little bit of apple and nutmeg. A hint of cinnamon. This is served with a sugared rim, but the bartender was nose enough to only rim half the glass.
Rock Bottom Des Moines Pumpkin Ale;West Des Moines, Iowa, United States;Flavored - Other;Rock Bottom Des Moines;Draught at Lost Duck Brew Pub in Ft. Madison, IA. Clear ornage color with thick off white head that laced the glass. Smelled and tasted of pumpkin pie and cinnamon. The flavor and aroma were just right, not cloying, as some pumpkin beers can be.
Beer Factory Heavy Metal;Mexico DF, Mexico;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Beer Factory Restaurant & Wood Grill;Veyr good, a little heavy, like it’s name says, and is veyr alcoholic. Thr foam stays there for ages and it seems that no matter how much you drink it never stops forming. Very dark one. The taste is sweet, due to the alcohol percentage, the barley is also good.
Silver Springs Classic Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Canned. Poured clear, honey golden with a short cap of bright white head. The aroma picked up honey, corn syrup, and pale malts.. a hint of cleaner on the back.. syrupy sweet overall. The flavor found more of the corn and honey at the core, with lemon zest tartness and bitterness around tacky finish.. slightly metallic. Light-bodied and a bit rough on the palate.. drinkable, but not much more than that.
Silver Springs Classic Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Pours yellow with minimal white head. slightly citrus aroma with metal and grass. Flavor is grassy and citrus.
Silver Springs Classic Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;355ml can. Pours dark straw colour with a fast fading white head. Aroma has some sweetish barley with lemon notes. Flavour is grainy, bready with lemon. Dry finish. Seemed to have a bit more body than your average pale lager. Fairly active and prickly carbonation.
Silver Springs Classic Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Picked this up from the singles bin at Willow Park in Calgary. Can only. Had to call the number on the can to figure out the origin of this beer. The guy on the other end was very friendly and happy to answer my questions. I guess this was originally a beer brewed by Labatt in B.C. back in the ’40s and they’ve revived the label in import form. There are a few Wisconsin-born brews that are sneaking into Alberta without declaring their origins! Anyway, I thought this was a decent pale lager actually. Perhaps it was because my expectations were so low (being can-only), but I had this with dinner tonight and it was okay! Pale yellow, big head with medium retention. Grainy and faintly sweet, crisp palate with a bit of citrus in there (especially noticable against the alfredo pasta I was eating). Definitely not the worst of the can-only bunch.
Reeb Dark Beer;Shanghai, China;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shanghai Asia Pacific Brewery (Heineken);Notizen: -süßer, etwas penetranter Geruch -süßer werdend -künstlich, muffig -leicht bitterer Nachgeschmack -spontaner Gedanke: Gummi (warum auch immer) Test vom 3.12.2006, Gebinde: Glasflasche Noten: 4,3,3,4,10,3 - 3,60
Reeb Dark Beer;Shanghai, China;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shanghai Asia Pacific Brewery (Heineken);Light brown. Clear. No head. Thin, barely any character. Hints of roast in the finish. The aroma is weak dark nutty boringness.
Reeb Dark Beer;Shanghai, China;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shanghai Asia Pacific Brewery (Heineken);"The label says ""Top Quality Premium Lager"". Well, it ain’t............ This one came in a clear bottle, not the green ones some beloved by China’s brewers. The misfortunes began with a tan, rocky head of short duration above a not bad looking and very dark body. NO light was getting through this one. Aroma was not so bad either, with some dark malts and maybe some coffee notes as well. Taste was quite something else, and not in a good way, either. Syrupy sweet with some other mysterious flavours as complements (melamine, perhaps); mouthfeel was sticky and the finish was also by far too sweet. This was almost undrinkable, and I feel I took one for the team by finishing it."
Reeb Dark Beer;Shanghai, China;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shanghai Asia Pacific Brewery (Heineken);Bottle 0.6 l. Cola brown, completely disappearing lemonade head. Fresh nose of hops and some coffeeish roasted maltiness. Berries. Flavor is candyish sweet (not sticky tho) and non bitter roasted maltiness. Berries here too with some paper. Very flavorful and fresh for a dunkel. This is not too far from good german dunkler bocks. Pretty damn nice surprise after regular Reebs. Smooth carb, nice body.
Reeb Dark Beer;Shanghai, China;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shanghai Asia Pacific Brewery (Heineken);Maybe the best cheap beer I had in China. Dark, but light body. Not too impressive in taste. Malty, but could use more spice.
Reeb Dark Beer;Shanghai, China;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Shanghai Asia Pacific Brewery (Heineken);Poured with a nice tan head and later a bit of lace. Brown walnut color. Lightly aromatic nose of toffee, a bit of cocoa and whiskey. Flavor is so so. a bit of a tang - some sharpness, although I do pick up some nice chocolate malt in there. Best of the Chinese beers yet. Drinking this 500 ml clear glass bottle of brew in my hotel room Shanghai.
Dent Baarister;Dent, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Dent Brewery;Cask @ Trackside, Bury. Darker clear chestnut-brown colour with a thick frothy head. It has a light malty nose, but it has a much more stated taste with some dry grainy malts that produce quite a nutty flavour that lingers in the palate a while.

Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Bottle. Clear amber color, medium tan head. Aroma of malted milk balls. Taste has mostly cocoa. OK.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Heavy caramel malt aroma. Dark maple body with on a thin film for a head. Sweet nutty taste. Goes down smooth on the tongue. Has a heavy mouth feel. More suited for winter enjoyment. A sipper verses a guzzler.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;March Ale Alpharetta. Toasted wheat, caramel, brown sugar, biscuity. Pretty on point for the style.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;16 oz. can, shared at Ale Alpharetta. Clear brown, with a thin, beige head. Nice nose of light coffee, caramel, a little salt, and syrup. Very sweet, with a touch of bitterness. Medium to heavy body, creamy, and clean. This is not a bad doppelbock.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Pours clear Amber with a nice eggshell head. Aroma has notes of toasted malt and dusty hops. Flavor has toasted malt, caramel, and subtle hoppy tones. Texture has average body and fizz. Navigate to any bar or beer store that had it.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Growler from the brewery. Pour is a brownish amber. Lighter and clearer than I was hoping, but still looks nice and is appropriate for the style. Thin head. Nose is sweet and fruity. Raisins and some nutty malt. Flavor is the same. Honey, candied pecans, red apple. Very sweet but not sticky. No hops or bitterness. Super smooth, slick palate. Really appealing mouthfeel for the style. Growler was consumed day of fill, but carbonation is low. Again, appropriate for the style. I picked this up hoping for a darker beer more like Celebrator, so I was initially disappointed, but it’s still a solid beer. Probably a little too much unchecked sweetness, but the style is all about malt, so I can’t complain.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Draft @ Cape Ann. Served year round since it’s July and I just drank it a few hours ago. Light amber color with thin head in a shaker glass. Aroma is caramel malt, toasted grain and light lager yeast. Flavor is again toasted grain, caramel malt, mild hints of fruit and light brown sugar. The carbonation gives a creamy texture that ends sweet. All malt in this brew, as it should be. For the style is just above average and I’m glad the spice was taking away from the recipe several years back. It is a nice, straight forward example of the style and not overly complex. German lager loves will not get to excited but it should do you just fine if you like this style.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Pours a hazy garnet color with a minimal beige head. Sweet toasted malt aroma has notes of agave syrup. Soft toasted malt flavor has a touch of caramel and vanilla bean. Slightly spicy with a hint of cinnamon on the palate. Overall, just average.
Cape Ann Fisherman's Navigator (2006-*);Gloucester, Massachusetts, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Cape Ann Brewing Company;Not a giant fan of this one. Tastes slightly burnt, whether a burned candy or even butter. Medium bodied with a decent head.

Hardeggerperle Schwarze Perle;Krauchthal, Switzerland;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hardeggerperle;From tap at Solothurner Biertage 2019. Nearly black chestnut brown with a nearly white light beige head.

Hardeggerperle Schwarze Perle;Krauchthal, Switzerland;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hardeggerperle;Bottle 50 cl from Volg in Krauchthal (CH). Dark brown to black, fine and short carbonation and fleeting foam. The smell of roasted malt wins, there is butter, chocolate, nuts. That we found to the taste, soft, toasted, medium roundness, without particular charasteristics, a little flat and thin. Final roasted, sweet. An easy and light beer.
Hardeggerperle Schwarze Perle;Krauchthal, Switzerland;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hardeggerperle;Bottled. Dark brown colour, not much head. Slight roasted malts and lots of sticky coffeeish and chocolateish sweetness in aroma. Flavour is quite sweet malts along with some ashed and dust. Also a very sweet flavour sticking in the background. BBE was late 2006, so maybe it starts showing signs of that the BBE actually was back then .) Still drinkable, but not too exciting, quite watery and empty.
Hardeggerperle Schwarze Perle;Krauchthal, Switzerland;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Hardeggerperle;"pours a clear dark brown colour with almost no traces of foam remaining; gently toasted with light notes of cocoa, chocolate and butter; quite sweet and medium-bodied at best; no bitterness and a dry finish showing notes of ashes and dust - terribly lacking of character and complexity"
Bullfrog McMinns Hop Harvest;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bullfrog Brewery;Aroma of floral hops, pine tree and some citrus. Taste is light and fresh. Juicy citrus hops with some grass. Also a bit thin and lingers a bit with the food.
Bullfrog McMinns Hop Harvest;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bullfrog Brewery;Medium copper with a thin lasting head Aroma is citrus and resinous hops- pnw with a touch of fresh cut grass- light dough and crystal malt as well. Flavor has more pine sap and rsin along with an almost lime like citrus hop character- good fresh chinook- almost a cold smokey piney resin character and a light sweetness backbone with nice harsh resinous hop bitterness. Becomes a bit weak as it warms and turns a bit watered down but if this were to be amped up it would be real nice.
Bullfrog McMinns Hop Harvest;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bullfrog Brewery;Tap. Aroma of pale malt and perfumy, floral hops. Flavor of sweet, fruity malt with a mildly resinous hop presence. Ok.
Bullfrog McMinns Hop Harvest;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Bullfrog Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Poured amber in color with a small beige head. Aroma of pine and citrus hops mostly.

La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;Converting ticks to ratings. Had this back in 2006 on tap at In de Wildeman. I remember this to be a very heavy, strongly hopped beer, biting bitterness, nettles, pine, some citrus, alcohol, yeasty. Had a palate that was used to sweet Belgian beers, this was quite a shocker. Didn't really enjoy it back then.
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;One-off IPA brewed in collaboration with Brooklyn Brewery, with no less than eight American and English hop varieties, of which five were used for dry-hopping. An IPA from a time when the style was only just beginning to get a foothold among Belgian micro breweries, with a fruity and malt sweetish onset quickly evolving in a dry, herbal and leafy, citrussy, very complex, long hop bitterness. Wonderful experiment, too bad it hasn’t been continued.
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;Tap at BT. Orange amber body with a thin off white head. Citrus with earthy and floral hops. Nice spices, and some strong hop resins to finish.
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;Tap at the Blind Tiger for the Brooklyn event. Very hoppy aroma, a touch of sweet and spice. Bacony, dank, peppery, deeply and wonderfully complex. I could smell this thing for ages. The flavor is sweet, savory, Belgian-inspired, with a thick body and good carbonation. Fairly mild, despite strong hops. Very interesting.
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;Draught. Pours a cloudy pale gold with almost no head. Nose is fruity, candy pineapple and citrus hops, quite sweet. Taste is a huge candy pineapple sweetness up front paired with citrusy hop note, with the spicy yeast presenting itself with a candy ginger note. Resiny pine hops emerge as the flavor progresses, lingering on the finish with more of the sweet candy note. Alcohol is present, but doesn’t get in the way. Mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly syrupy with subdued carbonation. Huge beer, unbelievably sweet, but not overly complex - but undeniably different.
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;Pours a slightly fogged gold with minimal head. Nose is strong with a tangerine/nectarine kind of thing. Flavor is beautifully hopped. It seems like the hops are well mixed with the Belgian yeast aspects. You can tell there is 9% alcohol on this one. It is a very slight detractor from the overall, though. Feel is very smooth liquid and nice on the carbonation too. Absolutely amazing beer. You don’t see a lot of IPAs in the Belgian style, but I would consider this an outstanding example. A complete travesty this is not mass produced.
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;"""The Final Batch"" Hazy oranged colored pour with small head. Florally, pine cone aroma with a strong citrusy, perfumy flavor."
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;Sampled on 2/16/07 on tap at Max’s 3rd Annual Belgian Beer Festival: Slightly hazy dark golden bronze appearance has a thin, wispy-lacing frothy white head. Aroma of sweet bready Belgian malt with some light fruity notes. Body starts full and pale malty sweet with some biscuity and caramely notes with a smooth toasty, bready yeasty finish. Nicely-balanced, an authentic malty Belgian strong ale, although I don’t see why this is classified as an IPA.
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;Slight hazy pale with small white head. The aroma is light, banana, bread and honey. The flavor is pepper, honey, pear, apple and corriander. Medium light body with sparkling/prickly carbonation.
La Brooklynette / La Gnomette Part II;Gouvy, Belgium;IPA;Lupulus;"draught at ZBF 2007: Hazy summer late afternoon glow with large thick meringue head. First impressions on the aroma was hops, hops, sweet summer fruits, slight eau de cologne, and umm... hops. After the first approach I began to notice some stale, sorry ""aged,"" hop aroma. Expecting to be overwhelmed by a harsh hop explosion, I was delighted to be met with a wonderful balanced (well... maybe not balanced) creamy libation. Sweetness, followed by bitterness, spice, green hop, then mellow hop. Hints of orange sherbert coming from deep within. The hops offered a nice interuption amongst many sticky sweet beers at the ZBF."
Stewart's Barrel of Monkeys;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Shared by Egadjzis. Pours a mostly clear yellow gold with a thinning head. Aroma is tons of bourbon, sweet sugar, belgian fruity esters almost out of contol and lots of green apple skin acetaldehyde. Flavor is apple juice, wood, oak, vanilla, solvent, cough syrup, phenolic yeast, fruity esters, pear and apple mixed, bourbon is strong, more acetaldehyde, and lemon and orange zest in the finish which leads to some oaky astringency. Kinda messy.
Stewart's Barrel of Monkeys;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Well i finally got eaglefan to try this puppy. Had to bludgeon him into finally trying this one! Was worth the wait though. Poured a small white head with decent retention and a bit of spotty lace. Clear, gold colored. Light bourbon notes up front with a gentle tropical fruitiness and some laid back wood notes too boot. Body is medium with a soft carbonation and a light pricklyness from the wood maybe? Flavors of mellow bourbon and wood backed by light Trippel notes of pepper and fruit, light citrus and some pencil shavings thrown in for good measure. Lightly sweet finish is bourbony and fruity. The bourbon notes were dominant but not stealing the whole show. Fairly well balanced and enjoyable. Aged nicely. I rather enjoyed this one. Thanks Brian!
Stewart's Barrel of Monkeys;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;750 bottle from summer of 06, finally got to this one. Pour was clear golden, nice white head, good retention, although it did thin to a smaller but complete covering. Carbonation was lively and healthy even after aging almost two years. The primary aroma components were apples, bananas, pears, sawdusty wood/oak, some bourbon too. Flavor followed the aroma, bourbon more in the aftertaste than primary experience (which is how it should be), some honey and other spicing, chainsaw wood notes. Only shortcoming of this was the lack of phenolic and light hop character that I love in my tripels, which could have been a result of the aging that otherwise did wonders for this brew. Good stuff, Stewarts!
Stewart's Barrel of Monkeys;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Much thanks to egajdzis who finally decided to break this out of his cellar since getting one of these rarities not too long ago. Appears a transparent gold with a small white head that slowly fades out into a mild cap. Spotty lacing is left around the glass. Smell is of coconut, vanilla, peach, pineapple, mango, and citrus. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with tropical fruit salad, and vanilla standing out in a luscious flavor that I find addictive. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly acidic, with tropical fruit and vanilla lingering in the aftertaste. I loved this beer and hope that it finds a way to me again.
Stewart's Barrel of Monkeys;Bear, Delaware, United States;Tripel;Stewart's Brewing Company;Poured a medium cherrywood color body with some white head lace.

Herold Black Chalice;Breznice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Herold;Herold Black Lager is a real drink , the best Schwarzbier in the world imo.

Swillable ,tasty Schwarz.
Herold Black Chalice;Breznice, Czech Republic;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivovar Herold;[Gravity cask at the Back of Beyond, Reading] Black with ruby hints, no head. Sweet chocolate, camp coffee and a bit of treacle causes it to be rather sweet up front. However, it’s saved by roasted malt coming through in the surprisingly dry finish. It’s rather nice actually.

Highwood Lincoln Red;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);Brown 500ml bottle, obtained from Beers of Europe, best before 28 Jul 2011, drank and reviewed 4 Jul 2011: poured into na UK pint sleeve glass. My bottle clearly called this Tom Wood’s Lincoln Red. True reddy brown coloured body, with a large off-white bubbley head on top, looks a treat. Aroma of roasted, toasted malts with semi-sweet molasses thrown in. The taste follows the smell, malts and molasses, but with a hop dry bite towards the end of the mouthfeel. As the mouth really dries between gulps the hop bitterness turns into an almost citrus mini-sourness (pink grapefruit?). Very nice in deed.
Highwood Lincoln Red;Barnetby, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lincolnshire Craft (prev Tom Wood's);A dark brown to red coloured beer with a thickish, off white head. A slightly sweet, malty nose, some toffee and a little perfumed. A bitter smoky malt taste, again a bitter sweet toffee and caramel, with a touch of liquorice, then a slightly spicy hop flavour.

A dark brown coloured beer with a russet hue and a whitish head. The aroma is sharp and fruity with orangey notes as well as beeries. The taste is very bitter with good English hops. Earthy also. A nice beer.

Stadtbühler Minimal;Gossau, Switzerland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Stadtbühl;pale yellow with decent head. Smells like a normal beer, not like an alc-reduced one. Quite malty, slightly hoppy and dry. Rather full bodied for a light beer. Normally I don’t like light beers very much, but this one is really good.
B&T Bodysnatcher;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - OGs Wellingborough. A copper coloured beer with an off-white head and lacing. Hidden in this beer is some citrus hop and a little alcohol character, but sadly my half was blighted by age and signs of the bottom of the barrel. Fruit skin aromas and flavours and a thin cardboardy palate. Not good nor right.
B&T Bodysnatcher;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;B&T Brewery;Cask at the Wellington Arms, Bedford. Dark gold. Only the faintest aroma. Some maltiness in the taste. Rather thin and lacking in body. Not surprising considering the name. Some residual bitterness. Not one of B&T’s best. And the pumpclip design is amateurish.

Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;From Feb 2008 I got this bottle in a trade with Nutbrown. Thanks Alan! It pours from 750ml bottle a clear medium gold with a good 2 finger head of foam and some nice sticky lacing. Subsequent pours bring a slight haze to the appearance. The smell I noticed as I popped the cap. A nice mix of fruit(apple & pear) and a healthy dose of hops. The taste matches the nose. Almost equal portions of fruit and hops that gives the overall flavour of tartness and grass. I read the label and they say that they don't consider it to be a true Belgian Tripel because of the hop presence(it says American Tripel) and I'd tend to agree though, after a few more sips, I'm getting notes of candy sugar and some peppery flavour. Call it what you like, this is a darn good Ale and a darn god sipper.Btw, no sign at all for me when it comes to the abv...good job! The mouthfeel is on the thick side and the carbonation is light but adequate, and it finishes with a lemony twang. Very enjoyable! This one is worth a repeat, in my book.
Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;May 22, 2014 - 750ml - my 2006 dated bottle - shared with blankboy, gregclow, jercraigs & mabel. Cloudy gold gusher with a huge white head. Bone dry aroma - fruit sweetness, floral bitterness and lots of yeast - like a devolved tripel (7-). Taste, well, it’s old - apple, yeast, alcohol ... solid body, airy - definitely oxidized, but for 8 years in my fridge, pretty frickin’ solid. I am betting it was beyond solid in its day.
Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Pours a hazy gold with a thin white lacing of head. Aroma is peppery with banana, pear and mango. Definitely some belgian phenols going on with some fruity hops. Taste is sweet and honeylike up front, followed up with stone fruit and pear following it up. Finishes spicy and clean with a light lingering bitterness.
Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours a clear gold with thick white head that lasts leaving spotty lacing. The aroma is honey and yeast. Medium mouth, fruity, light spice, citrus, hides alcohol well, good.
Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;"750mL bottle bought from brewery 12/28/14 and drunk fairly shortly thereafter Initially large white head tops a sparkling golden-copper body that is very clear. Hmmm...almost too clear. As suspected, no sediment whatsoever at the bottom. Which is fine, I guess, but was hoping this would be unfiltered (or less filtered, anyways). Fruity esters mix with leafy, fragrant hops. Amarillos are one of my favorite American hops and they are fine here, if a bit unexciting. Little bit of tangerine, mint, touches of white grapefruit and tons of yellow fruits from the yeast (pineapple, nectarines, peaches). Alcohol heat is definitely felt, though not raw or overpowering, while the malts seem a bit absent. Very dry crackers, white bread and a touch of honey mixing with the alcohol and esters to give sort of a marmalade note. The flavor comes off heavily peachy; moreso, even, as it warms. Sort of a bittersweet component, with light pineapple, alcohol warmth and touches of black pepper. Hops aren’t too bitter, thankfully and there’s some malt sugar to lend balance, but it’s a bit messy, coming off lightly syrupy and yet grainy/husky as well. Carbonation is initially engaging, if somewhat prickly, but falls off too quickly, leaving the beer feeling a bit flabby and exposing the syrupy and boozey qualities. Could easily be a top notch beer if this wasn’t so filtered and the alcohol was dialed back even 1%. The lack of bottle conditioning really detracts here."
Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;750ml bottle, slight hazy honey gold hue, with a white head. Nice fruity belgian yeast nose, with light a floral leafy, grassy, piney, coniferous hop, honeyed pale, toasted, pilsener, bready malt accent, with some citrus, grapefruit esters, and a faint lemon pie crust, panettone cake dough, phenolic note in the aroma follows through on a medium-bodied palate with a fruity, doughy, yeasty, faint funky, flowery citrus,leafy, grassy hoppy character, with some fait spicy pepper lemon, honeyed pale, wheat, toasted, bread malty, subtle candyish honey lollipop, candied lemon, grapefruit rind flavours, leading towards a honeyish maltiness, lingering citrus, leafy hop bitterness finish.
Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold;Elmsford, New York, United States;Tripel;Captain Lawrence Brewing Company;A yellow hay color extremely cloudy, decent head retention lingers.

Black Oak H&H Overkill;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Black Oak Brewing;Volo Cask Days ’06. Light gold. Nose is jalapeno, doughy malt. Smells like a great pizza. Flavor is dominated by jala but not overwhelmed. Peppery, light toasted malt. Honestly the best pepper beer I’ve had.
Black Oak H&H Overkill;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Other;Black Oak Brewing;Cask at Volo Cask Day 2006. Pours a clear pale gold with a small diminishing white head. Aroma: whoa, that’s jalapeno alright, pretty much nothing but! Flavour of jalapenos along with some hops -- not as hot as I expected from the aroma. Light bodied. I’m rating this slightly higher then I actually liked it because I’m not very fond of jalapenos but for what this is, it’s fairly well done.
Neustadt Springs Big Dog Porter;Neustadt, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Neustadt Springs Brewery;Can at Tallboys in Toronto. Lightish brown with huge creamy white head. Bready sour aroma and flavour, rather unpleasant. Roast in the background. Watery on the palate. Didn’t bother taking much more notes... And only now I read it’s brewed with wine. Haha, might explain some things, I thought it had gone off. Anyway, an unpleasant failure in my book.

Appearance: hazy gold, with smallish white (pourous) head. Green, citrussy front, short bitterness followed with sweet finish. Drinkable bitter-sweet ale.

Candy/brown sugar sweet grainy aroma, a hint of burnt peat and ripe peaches or apricots. The taste is sweet malt - my brain alternated between processing it as ""burnt maple syrup and woody malt"" and ""stewed apricots"" - weird. An average paleager body, sticky and syrupy mouthfeel, very cloying but has an odd smokey/bitter aftertaste - it’s better than you’d think, but I preferred their earlier Maple Bush Lager in the big-ass bottles."

Aroma is herbal with a very green character, and a fresh maltiness - nice, but a little young. Flavour is nice as well, a good balance of fresh hops and soft malt that becomes more prominent in the finish, but again, it seems a little undefined and rough around the edges. As Radek suggests, another couple of weeks of lagering would do some good, but even so, it was enjoyable.

Mickey Finns Red Menace;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber with a toupe head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a nice grassy hop note with a hint of pine and a strong grain backbone. Flavor has a combination of grassy hops with some nice grain notes and a hint of alcohol.
Mickey Finns Red Menace;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;"I had a version of this at FoBAB ’07 that had for its description, ""Wild red ale aged 1 year in a French oak barrel, blended with young red ale."" My rating’s going here since, not having had the original, I really don’t know if there’s a difference. It had a dirty amber body with a slender ecru ring in lieu of a head. The aroma had a wild kind of funkiness to it, not too strong, over scents of orchard fruit. The flavor had a sweet base, caramel, fruit, and light brown sugar, with a moderate bitterness and a touch of the wild. Pretty decent brew. Festival of Barrel Aged Beers, Chicago, IL 11/03/2007"
Mickey Finns Red Menace;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;"12 oz draught at the brewpub, mid-October 2006, as ""Brewers Reserve Strong Red Ale."" Pretty nearly opaque burnt amber to dried blood in color with a creamy-bubbly light tan head, nicely lasting with a touch of lace....lots of PNW hops in the aroma, caramel and a hint of vanilla-whisky, seems perhaps barrel aged or flavored with oak chips?; piney-grapefruity characteristics dominate, touches of dried fruit also in evidence....the body is mostly malty-sweet, brown sugar dominating pungent, bitter oily hops.....carbonation fairly low, oakiness evident towards the finish which is just a bit too lactic/sour for what it is. Still an interesting, drinkable example."
Mickey Finns Red Menace;Libertyville, Illinois, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mickey Finns Brewery & Pub;Hazy and dark ruby chocolate in color with a dark tan head that’s hugging lastingly to the glass. Rhubarb and plum caramel meet a fabricy softness for a clean and sweet aromatic introduction. A touch of caramel marinated grapefruit and liquefied red figs join with a praline toffee trait on the tails of the waft. Big flavor presence with black cherries and plum butter sinking into graham pie crust. Rhubarb and an emphasized simcoe and cascade presence give an authoritative bitter/flavor hop combo. Figs are there with some rummy red toffee. Come to think of it, nearly all fruited contributors are red. Sure, there’s some nuttiness from the dates and accent flavors of broiled grenadine poured over pralines, but we’re principally dealing with dark red fruits here. Amaretto wafers and caramelized dates meet the bright blood red grapefruit juice for a cleaving, flavorful finish.
Church End Bobs Dog Jumping Frogs;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Church End Brewery;Cask Handpump from the outside festival bar at the Star Inn, Huddersfield 03/12/2005 Clear golden coloured very hoppy and citrus flavoured with a crisp and slightly bitter malt finish.
Church End Bobs Dog Jumping Frogs;Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Church End Brewery;At the Ridge Lane brewery. Brilliant gold pint with white suds. A puckering blast of quinine-bitter American hop zestiness. One of the bitterest pints I’ve ever had. Very sulphurous, very grapefruity, very biscuity. Very everything. A hint of shampoo to finish. Sweet biscuity afters cushion the hop punch. At least as bitter as XX Bitter, Orval et al. Musty hopsack and Burton snatch aroma. Tangerine, grapefruit, oats and pencil shavings. As hoppily bitter as an American IPA, if not as lip-smackingly fruity. Bonus point for sheer hop pungency.

Blue Moon Summer Honey Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Looks like Blue Moon dropped ""Summer"" from their Summer Honey Wheat [it's now just Honey Wheat]. They must have dropped the honey too. I expected a little more honey flavor and was disappointed to find that it was nearly non-existent. It's still a good wheat beer. It's just not a honey wheat beer."

Blue Moon Summer Honey Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Honestly, I think this beer deserves a higher rating than it deserves. Refreshing wheat aftertaste with the slightest hint of honey. Not overly sweet, which is a plus. Slight improvement over original flavor. Best consumed after an eight hour shift.
Blue Moon Summer Honey Wheat;Denver, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Well. I didn't have a cataclysmic brain aneurysm after drinking it so I consider that a success. Or not. When you're looking to shake up your feeble and ever-diminishing brain cells, load those wily bastards up on Blatz and let the good times roll.....right into oblivion. That's my kind of party.

Blue Moon Chardonnay Blonde;Denver, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Backlog rating on 9-14-2012 at Cap n’ Cork Covington Plaza, Fort Wayne, IN, beer tasting. This bottled beer’s appearance is a small white head, pale yellow transparent body, very little carbonation, and spotty amounts of lacing. The aroma is white grapes, fruity, citrus, wheat, and yeast. The flavor is sweet, white grapes and wine. The mouthfeel is smooth and this beer is medium bodied. This beer is very quaffable and the 8.5% ABV is well masked.
Blue Moon Chardonnay Blonde;Denver, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"""Pours a hazy gold with a small quick-fading bright white head. The aroma dominated by grapes with a touch of honey and light spice. The taste is all grapes up front followed by some banana sweetness, lemon, and light clove on the finish. The mouthfeel has moderate carbonation and a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Overall it’s tasty and refreshing with big Chardonnay grape flavor and just a hint of booze. Nice high ALC of 8.5% it’s hidden well."

Blue Moon Chardonnay Blonde;Denver, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Interesting offering. Aromas of malt, yeast, and grapes. Sweet flavor maybe a bit heavy on the grape juice but still respectable I would still try it again. I wonder if cellaring this one would help it evolve a bit.
Blue Moon Chardonnay Blonde;Denver, Colorado, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Blue Moon Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle, shared with Ian and Colin over a game of Power Grid. Lager-like pour, medium gold, average head, poor retention. Aroma is sweet, perhaps suggestive of white grape juice, but mostly sweet grains. Flavour is sweet, like soda, like Canada Dry ginger ale mixed with a basic sweet lager. Not my thing at all, not even as a summer beer. Drain pour actually.

Mongozo Coconut;Melle, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Huyghe;Shared bottle at Ethiopian restaurant in Amsterdam. Again probably a mix of brewed ver and an coconut extract. The only thing you smell and taste is fake coconut. Not as disgusting as its banana brother, bit still a bad idea.

Elysian Portergeist;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);on tap at brewery. dark, dark brown color.

Like the stout, a nice roasted flavor, but no pumpkin.Chocolate notes, w. some graininess and the roastiness well-balanced by a soupcon of bitterness. A great porter, albeit lacking in pumpkin qualities.
Elysian Portergeist;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter - Smoked;Elysian Brewing (AB InBev);Definitely a tasty smoked porter...didn’t get much from the pumpkin, but who cares?

Aroma is neither appealing nor offensive - cereal / bread with citrus notes.Medium body with reasonable carbonation. Taste is pretty awful.

Very unpleasant (lets see if red curry chips will mask it).

Anise in flavour with moderate sweetness of dark chocolate. And yes, some milky hints can be spotted. A well-judged stout (Half pint on gravity at The Ipswich Beer Festival 22.09.2006 and another half at The St Albans Beer Festival 28.09.2006).
Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the Seven Stars, Bristol 05/08/10. Deep gold in colour with a decent, off-white head. Lemon and green herb aroma. Slightly sweet malt flavour, with a hint of lime and massive bitter finish, which was a touch touch aggressive for me. Good.
Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;"Cask handpull, The Devonshire Cat, Sheffield. Pale bronze with a level white head draping the glass. Good aroma; flowery hop, honey on wholemeal, lemon meringue. Dankness, lemon and honey: a winning combo. Quietly impressive, with some pungent, off-beam, dank dishcloth hops."
Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;cask at the bow ... nice golden amber ... sweet green fresh hop nose ... dry front ... juicy sweet creamy soft hop ... subtle but tasty ... reall like this
Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;Half pint, cask. Shiny, golden brown body. Bright, naked surface. Fragile lacework on the top of the glass. Discreet smell of malts and fruits. Earthy malts and sweet fruits in flavour along with a bittersweet ending. Rather jam-like. Soft in the mouth. Medium bodied. Enjoyed in very relaxing Sunday atmosphere at the Duck and Drake in Leeds, 11.07.2010.
Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;Cask, gravity at Merton Summer Beer Festival, 17-07-10 Pours gold with slim white head, nice clarity to this. Aroma is a bit zingy with citrus, a touch of freshly chopped garden herbs and a little pine. This is a clean tasting fresh crisp tasty bitter beer, the lemon and pine show a little in the mouth, and whilst this is really enjoyable its never likely to have that wow factor.

Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;Cask conditioned at Merton Summer Beer Fest ’10. Gold with white head. These single hop showcases are great and thought provoking, Green Bullet tasted like a Czech,lagery hop to me, pine and lemon, a little resinous. I’m not sure we will see a lot of this hop over here, it doesn’t quite fit an Ale, but good stuff all the same.
Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;A Mes rate. Gravity at Merton Beer Festival. Thanks to Fin for making sure I got to try this as it was on the way out. Very clean gold with a greenish tinge and a thin but lasting white head. Lovely New Zealand hoppage on the nose but let down a little by a hint of diacetyl. Thankfully it’s not apparent in the mouth. Maybe just a light unexpected sweetness but it’s not a bad thing. In fact it sits really well alongside the assertive bitter and grassy hops. Very good citric notes. Slight leather and peat from the malt, which does a good job of carrying the flavours. A new hop to me and one I found to be quite interesting.
Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Penny Black JDW, Northwich 11/06/2010 Malt and hop aromas. Small white head. Golden coloured hoppy and bitter with a little dryness in a pale malt finish.

Acorn Green Bullet;Wombwell, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Acorn Brewery;Gravity, Turf Tavern Autumn Beer Festival. Pale gold with a cap of off-white. Blackberry and mint aroma, just a faint touch of sulfer clouds the otherwise very pretty hops. Big clean bitterness, rounded soft malt, a nice touch of bready warmth in the finish. Solid.
Shaws Willamette Pale;Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Shaws Brewery;Pale golden coloured. Low level of foam. Inviting hoppy aroma. A rich flavour of hop fruitiness ending with moderate bitterness. Pale ale impression (Half pint on gravity dispenser at the Ipswich Beer Festival 21.09.2006).

Felinfoel Dragons Heart;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felinfoel Brewery;Bottle from Aldi Supermarket, Keighley. Amber-red with a very thin head. Fairly standard mildly sweetened bitter. In terms of texture it's also mildly sticky-sweet, tasting slightly dry within its balanced hops and malts.
Felinfoel Dragons Heart;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felinfoel Brewery;Bottle whilst barbecuing the f*ck out of some mackerel. Coppery ruby with a fine beige foam going the distance. Dull but perfectly serviceable big regional nutmeg and egg custard yeast and Allsorts tones. Aroma the same with Everton mint. Sugared liquorice. Nil hops. Pleasant.
Felinfoel Dragons Heart;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felinfoel Brewery;A nice dark red colour, head vanishes quickly. Malty backbone with plummy fruit flavours coming through, but not overpowering. Not an ordinary bitter and the better for it. I quite like it

Felinfoel Dragons Heart;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felinfoel Brewery;"50cl bottle from Aldi, Bracknell. A reddish amber pour with a billowing beige head; aromas of purple fruit; sweet caramel malt taste with some musty fruit; and a light earthy bitterness. Reminded me of a watered down version of Hobgoblin. Unexciting."
Felinfoel Dragons Heart;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felinfoel Brewery;500ml bottle: BBE March 19. Drank at home on 24th June 18. Red hue to the brown body, beige head. A malty brew with a caramel leaning in the aroma and sweetness within the taste. My sweet tooth liked it, but the beer is a bit 'one dimensional' really.

Felinfoel Dragons Heart;Llanelli, Dyfed, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Felinfoel Brewery;Bought a couple of cans of this over the weekend, unfortunately turns out they were spoiled and I left a less than favorable review, which I've removed (rating stays though, because it's the truth!). I guess this shit happens. Looking forward to maybe trying this properly one day.

Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;10/18/08 On draught at the brewpub, Fairfield, Ca. Aroma is faintly sweet. Appearance is clear yellow with a very well maintained white head. Flavor is candy sweet forward with a light citrus bittering and an odd, but blended, cream note. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy with low carb texture and medium body. Overall, different but drinkable.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;On tap at OBriens 2008 Wet Hop Festival weekend. Backlogged rating. Something went wrong here. I remember tasting something like spoiled peanut butter. Flavor is also of rotten wort. Hops are there, though, in the finish.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;Tap @ O’Brien’s. Pours clear gold with great lacing. Nose was kind of funky, grainy, and fruity........not bad.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;Pours clear yellow with a big white head. Stinky aroma of banana and sweat. Thin mouthfeel. More banana in the taste, but with pine oil. Another miss for Blue Frog.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;Tap. A little bizarre in terms of the flavor and aroma. Aroma was malty and BOish. Gold color with a white head. Fruit and strange flavor. A bit watery. Not very good.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;Tap @ O’brien’s during wet hop fest. Blue Frog really sucks from what I’ve had. Pours yellow with a bright white head. Nose is light and dead. Taset is light and crappy, not surprised that this ain’t good.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;Draft at O’Brien’s. Actually pretty nice. Spicy aromas. Some banana on the flavor suprised me a bit. More spice on the flavor mixed in with the fresh hop flavors. Pretty hoppy on the finish. Good.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;Phenolic and DMS laden nose. Biscuity and herbal palate with floral hop notes. Herbal and fruity finish.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;Tasted on tap at the 2007 Bistro Wet Hop IPA Festival. This IPA pours a light gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma begins with strong floral hops and then gives way to some yeast and esters, very fruity. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are floral and citrusy. Interesting beer. A hoppy Belgian blonde or a fruity IPA? Take your pick. Fruity with a bone dry finish. Nice balance, but a touch sweet. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and crisp and fairly dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
Blue Frog Last Hop Standing;Fairfield, California, United States;IPA;Blue Frog Brewery;On Tap @ The Wet Hop Event at the Hayward Bistro. It pours a hazy deep gold with a copper hue running through the middle and thin bright white head. The aroma is mild with hints of sweet malts and vague hoppiness but also with pretty big Belgian yeast notes of banana and bubble gum. The hops show up first in the flavor but are quickly outshined by banana and mild bubble gum notes. Midway the Centennial hops break free of the Belgian influence and bath the flavor in subtle hoppiness. Interesting offering.
WJ King Harvest Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;Cask at Holborn Whippet with Sarah. Pours a clear gold with a creamy white head that dissipates slowly to the edges and laces. Aroma has a note of musty hay with a good amount of grass and some wet grain. Flavor starts with grain and hay with a bit of grass coming out in the finish.
WJ King Harvest Ale;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;King Beer;A Mes rate: Cask at Twickenham Beer Fest. A good fresh hopped English Ale. Tobacco, hops and just a touch of malt in the aroma. Standard looks. Brown body with a bubbly head. All fresh hops flavour wise. Slightly tart. White grapes in the finish with more fresh hops. All about the hops. Nice beer.
Lancaster Rose Milk;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;had this awhile ago, just noticed someone entered it. pretty good brew, bit of a creamy body, lightly hoped with a nice blend of milk stout, pretty good.
Lancaster Rose Milk;Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Lancaster Brewing Co.;This was the latest cask release on tap at LBC on 10/21/06. It’s a preblended mix of Red Rose Ale & Milk Stout, making for a deliciously, malty brew. Appears a red toned, transparent dark brown with a light tan head that slowly fades out. Spotty lacing is left all around the glass. Smell is of caramel, nuts, light cocoa, sweet, roasted chestnuts, spices, along with a florally bouquet of hops mixed with brown sugar and fruit. Taste is a nice mix of the mentioned aromas touching upon the sweetness of the stout and the malty/hop balance of the Red Rose. Mouthfeel is smooth, sweet, malty mix of the caramel and hops running along the tongue in a slick but satisfying motion.
Anglo Dutch Autumn Ale;Liversedge, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Partners Brewery;"Cask (handpump) at the Palace, Leeds. Hmm. Handwritten pump clip. No ABV shown. According to the barman ""Yes I am sure that’s what its called"" and ""No, I don’t know the ABV"". I can’t find any reference to this beer anywhere, nor can I identify any other Anglo Dutch beer that fits the bill. And the brewery website is a fat lot of use as the ""Latest Brewery News"" is from November 2004. So I think I’ll have to take the pump clip at face value. The beer? Oh, its fairly standard autumnal stuff with crystal malt to the fore, providing caramel and toffee notes and a soft underlying bitterness. Mid copper colour. Nothing out of the ordinary."
Cornerstone Present Use of Mary Bradley;Berea, Ohio, United States;Mild Ale;Cornerstone Brewing Company;pours a dark brown with a light tan head. notes of nuts, toast, bread, irish moss, and honey. good.
Cornerstone Present Use of Mary Bradley;Berea, Ohio, United States;Mild Ale;Cornerstone Brewing Company;"On Tap @ Cornerstone some time around 3/15/06, just found this one in my notes that was not entered: Medium coppery brown, clear, w/ a lasting medium sized off white head. Toasty malt aroma w/ a hint of roast and caramel. Slightly sulphury yeast w/ some green apple fruitiness; clean otherwise. Flavor is well balanced w/ clean toasty/bready flavors and a hint of roast and green apple same as the aroma. Just a touch of dark grain tartness. Fuller light body, smooth, low carbonation adds to smoothness. When I had it I thought that it could have used a bit more age to get rid of the green apple. I know it’s a short turn around style, but I still thought it could aged just a bit longer, otherwise a solid session beer!"
Cornerstone Present Use of Mary Bradley;Berea, Ohio, United States;Mild Ale;Cornerstone Brewing Company;Great beer. The server said that the brewer wrote a book on this style of beer and it shows. It was nice and roasty, but wth no off-putting sharpness. i drank four pints and would love to buy it in bottles. I hope that they start packaging soon. Well worth the effort of finding the pub (not close to a highway)
Peeterman Artois;Leuven, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);The forebearer to the watered down version of Stella was an acceptable effort that was still as tasty as others from the same family. Had this at one of the bars inside the Millennium Dome o2 complex.

Peeterman Artois;Leuven, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Can - Poured to a fizzy head which did not last. Didn’t really enjoy what flavour there was, the coriander notes just didn’t work for me.
Peeterman Artois;Leuven, Belgium;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Draught. Awful. Imagine a watered-down version of the ghastly Stella and you are pretty much there. Wheat beer my arse!

Weak malty aroma, some light caramel. High carbonation, a bit thin. Flavour is practically non-existent. No malts and no hops to speak of... not bad, just more water than anything else.
Bristol Beer Factory Red;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Bristol Beer Factory;[cask at the Grain Barge, Bristol] Pours the expected dark ruby in colour, thin white head. Very slightly spicy from the Bramling Cross, rounded aroma from the sweet malt. Sweet and caramelly on the palate, but with no cloying edges. Finish is sweet, quite long in duration, and pretty satisfying [17102009]
Bristol Beer Factory Red;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Bristol Beer Factory;Cask (handpump) @ The Microbar, Manchester, England. @ [ RBESG 09 ]. Red brown with a big foamy head. Malty with spicy note. Some toffee caramel. Easy drinking and a nice change after all the blonds.

Light body, low carbonation, very slightly bitter finish.
Bristol Beer Factory Red;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Red Ale - Irish;Bristol Beer Factory;A Mes rate: cask at the Microbar. Darkish amber with a pretty impressive off white head. Assertive fruit and nut character but with some really good earthy malt in the background. Big caramel finish. Possibly a little under hopped but for something that I would not usually think too much of, I rather enjoyed this.

Dugges Rudolf 2006;Landvetter, Sweden;Flavored - Other;Dugges Bryggeri;Draught@Pikkulintu (way back in 2006). Hazy deep ambery brown colour, small beige head. Aroma is fruity and floral hops along with some spicyness. Flavour is spices, hops and some sweet malts. Balanced and quite pleasant beer, that probably suits the X-mas table.
Dugges Rudolf 2006;Landvetter, Sweden;Flavored - Other;Dugges Bryggeri;Brown, hazy, with red notes. Malty aroma with notes of barnyard, sweet fruit, citrus and spicy hops. Citrus flavour with notes of american hops, vanilla and cinnamon rolls. Round with some kick in the finish and some acidity.

Dugges Rudolf 2006;Landvetter, Sweden;Flavored - Other;Dugges Bryggeri;On tap at Bishops Arms, Göteborg, Sweden, in december 2006. Nice appearance, aroma quite herbal and hoppy. Flavor a dissapointment. A little thin and with somewhat sticky hop notes. But interesting in some way. Have had better Dugges.
Dugges Rudolf 2006;Landvetter, Sweden;Flavored - Other;Dugges Bryggeri;[Draught] Cloudy orange colour. Not the biggest head. Rich fruity aroma with tidbits and red apple. Bit spicy. Rounded, almost oily mouthfeel and very British. Berries and licorice was what I detected in this orgy of hard-to-track flavours. Pale spicy. Very flavourful with perfect balance in bitterness.

Tarka Stock Ale;Barnstaple, Devon, England;Old Ale;Tarka Ales;"Bottle, 300ml, bottle conditioned. A dark black colour with a large brown head. Strong aromas initially of fresh grassy hops and citrus then evolving into sweet plum and toffee with a touch of malt. The aroma is very fruity and lasts as long as the beer without diminishing one bit. The taste is initially treacle, then very malty with chocolate and toffee. Fairly sweet but not overly so. A quite sweet, strong bitter finish with alcohol evident. Moderate carbonation. This is a good warming ale with an outstanding aroma and flavour; if this was the only beer I could drink for the rest of my life, I would be happy."

Banks's Bostin Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Cask (handpump) at the Minster Inn, York. A functional but uninspiring Midlands style best bitter - more malt than hop. Nutty overtones. Copper colour, tight sparkled head. A touch more body and flavour than the standard Banks’s Bitter. Bostin is actually a term used in the Midlands (whether it comes from Birmingham or the Black Country is open to debate) to show rapturous approval. I can’t go that far with this beer. Nothing wrong with it, and goes down quite well. Just a bit dull.
Banks's Bostin Bitter;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Banks's (Marston's);Cask handpull at Folkestone Wetherspoons. Mid brown colour with lasting bubbly beige head. Drinkable inoffensive malty bitter. Stronger choc malt than most bitters. It’s fine. Nice tangy hop on end. Better than I expected.

Clean malts and nutty crystal malt. Dusty bitterness starting at the back of the mouth and moving forwards to fill the mouth. Joined by almost cloying finish which wasnt to my taste and a bit odd as it was fairly dry. Some whiskeyish undertones.
John Harvards Dortmunder Amber;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;Thanks to dickinsonbeer for the hand filled bottle... Appears a transparent, copper toned amber with a small white head that slowly fades into a mild cap. Scattered spots of lacing are left around the glass. Smell is very mild of earthy notes, light diacetyl, buttery cream, citrusy hops, and light caramel. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a bitter, buttery, light caramel flavor sort of washing the palate. This is definitely not one that will overload the senses. Mouthfeel is bitter, citrusy, clean for the most part, with a little bit of a residual yeastiness that hangs on the swallow.
John Harvards Dortmunder Amber;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;Had bottled sample courtesy of Dickinsonbeer (thanks!). Poured a darker and clear amber / orange color with a small sized off white head. Softer aromas and tastes of caramel, fruity, citrus and some toasted malts. Although nothnig really stood out in the aromas and flavors (did I mention the word softer), I found this easy to drink and refreshing.
John Harvards Dortmunder Amber;Wayne, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;John Harvards Brewhouse Wayne;Pours a clear deep copper/amber with low carbonation and a thin head. Color is very deep for a dortmunder and borders on jsut being an amber lager, although there are some fruity ester hints reminding me a bit of an ale throughout. Aroma is slightly fruity, toasted malts, very herbal and hoppy. Very hoppy bitter flavor with some nice rounded sweet malts and a bit of esters. Herbal hops all the way through. Carbonation is a bit low for a lager as well. Decent drinking beer, but doesnt really fit in any style- not like there’s anything wrong with that.
St. Bernardus Christmas Ale;Watou, Belgium;Quadrupel / Abt;St. Bernardus Brouwerij;(Draught at Oliver Twist, Stockholm, 1 Dec 2018) Dark brown colour with frothy, beige head.

Really tasty and warming winter beer. Very nice.

Poured as expected, full golden color with a generous white head. The aroma was bananas and other fruity type esters.

Code 7 High Gravity Premium Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);I can’t believe this graffiti-and-skyline can contains a beer so rare, so exclusive, that is has been rated only once. The body is so light I hesitate to describe its color, but know that it is as pale as a moderately-hydrated hiker’s urine. A sweet, corny aroma greets my nose hairs. Sweet, strange body, very thin and watery, nothing potent like I expected. Corn and water. Plastic. A must try for the cornchaser.
Code 7 High Gravity Premium Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);The ABV isn’t indicated on the 24-ounce can, but this seems rather mild for a malt liquor. Looks like one, urine yellow with a quickly departed head. Smells like corn, generic malts, alcohol, and plastic. I miss the usual metallic elements, but they show up in the flavor. Along with the plastic, alcohol, creamed corn, and a dirty bitterness. Special! Party Pak Liquors, Indianapolis, IN

Sweet and quite malty with medium body. Has a full array of Soviet style buttery cellar flavours, but in this case the flavours are kept under control and actualy gives the beer a bit of character. Finishes with notes of hay but low bitterness.
Zip Piwo Abadan;Ashgabat, Turkmenistan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pivzavod Biyat H.J.;I finally sat down to have this brew. Bottle. I was suspecting something really bad. But I was actually wrong. Weak hazy yellow colour with an amazing long lasting head. Some sweet maltish aroma. The flavour is not fresh from tap...but actually allright. Some malty sweetness with an average syrup feeling on the tongue. I will most likely never try a beer from Turkmenistan again so I actually tried hard to enjoy it. Thank you Jamal from Azerbaijan!

Dark-ish bitter with a strong citrus character and a competing flavour of (very) sweet malt. All finished with a typically sharp and bitter aftertaste.

Finishes watery and tangy. Nice! Kevin definitely brought this recipe down with him from Virginia.
Front Street Peppers Mild;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Mild Ale;Front Street Brewery (NC);The server told me about this one, and that it was a new brew that was served a little warmer than typical beer, and not as full of CO2. He was right, but it was pretty good. Smell was sweet, spicy, and it was very similar to a pumpkin ale kind of. Probably a fall seasonal, but I do not want to enter that in without being 100% sure. Taste is smooth and very easy to drink. The most unique beer I drank there. Quite pleasing.
Front Street Belgian Wit;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Front Street Brewery (NC);Hazy bright orange pour. Fluffy white head and drippy lace. Banana and spice on the nose. Caramel, clove, and banana
Front Street Belgian Wit;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Front Street Brewery (NC);Draft pours a cloudy copper with a 3cm white head. Hints of candied sugar, citrus fruits, spice. Finishes with a light sugary wheat taste.
Front Street Belgian Wit;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Front Street Brewery (NC);The aroma was estery with a banana presence and a very light spice coupled with wheat. The beer arrived lightly hazy pale tannis (murky) yellow with a low off-white head. The flavor was wheat with light spice and more estery banana presence with caramel. The body was medium with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy texture on the palate. A really tasty beer, but this really did not contain the characteristics of a witbier. The finish was ultimately dry with a light lasting spice. Pint at the Brewpub.

Front Street Belgian Wit;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Front Street Brewery (NC);Bright golden in color with a small white head. Smell is full of lemons and corriander, with some orange notes too. Smooth and refreshing, very easy to drink. Reminded me alot of hoegaarden but it had more lemon flavors. Damn fine! I think the new brewer is really showing his stuff with this and the mild ale, very nice stuff.
Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;On tap at Zierholz, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Aroma is pretty bland, with not much other than dry biscuity malt. Flavour is very gentle, with biscuity malt and a gentle fruity hopping. Bland and pointless, but clean.
Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;On tap. Served a light golden color with a small head and bits of lacing.

Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;On tap at brewpub. Have had a few kolsch’s before, and enjoyed them for what they are, but this still seemed a bit sub par to me. Poured a clear light yellow, with a small and rapidly dissapearing white head. Highly carbonated. Not much of an aroma, bit of citrus. Flavour was dominated by citrus and a light malt, very refreshing, but still the flavours were far too muted.
Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;(tap) Honestly I can’t say much about this one. It was an easy drinking Kölsch-type beer but from memory it was quite watery and sweet. I was expecting something drier and more interesting but instead I got yet another pale drink with a few beer-type elements. Should appeal to the ladies and non-beer drinkers.
Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;Draught at Zierholz Brewery, Canberra. Pours golden with a small white head. Aroma of malt, fruit and light spicy notes. The flavour is malt and fruit. Light bodied and OK carbonation. A good Kolsch, though I’ve never been a big fan of this style.
Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;Tried at the brewery. Clear pale yellow body. A bit of yeast in the taste, subtle fruit aroma, light in body, clean, crisp and what you expect in well made kolsch style.
Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;My pick of the Zierholz range (though the Hopmeister and Porter also impressed) and yet another Aussie Kölsch that’s better than the majority of the real thing. Bright, clean, fresh, sunny pils malt with some crackery edges, light but noticeable unripe apple and berry esters and not much hop character but lovely soft noble bitterness. Looks good, and nice light but characterful mouthfeel. Delicate, like eczematic says below. A classy beer, the kind of thing that should appeal to geeks and the general public alike. $5 a pint (in happy hour) is insane, too.
Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;I was keen to try any of the Zierholz range on my return to Canberra from Perth. Debacles in Braddon was just around the conrer and had the German Ale on tap so I sampled plenty. A really nice easy drinking beer with just the right amount of flavour and taste for my likings. Not hopped too far over the top and I could have stayed with this beer for an entire evening with ease. The fruit palate is at a perfect level for my tastes and there is no hint of aftertaste. A top drop. I’ve since tried the other Zierholz beers and this is by far my favourite.
Zierholz German Ale;Canberra, ACT, Australia;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Zierholz Premium Brewery;Didn’t know what a Kolsch was and not sure I’m any better for now knowing. A spritzy, fizzy, soft drink with grass overtures. Strange drop indeed. Not sure I’d seek out this style again. Similarly had at Debacle in Canberra on tap.

Northern Plains Red River Valley Red Lager;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);355ml bottle. Mahogany coloured and malty lager. Good body, good balance - not too sweet or too dry. Soft hops. Decent enough quality and quite pleasant.
Deschutes The Abyss;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial Flavored;Deschutes Brewery;2016 vintage on tap @ Carwyn Cellars. Pours a jet black with a dark brown head. Aromas are super rich in oak, liqourice, spices and dark roasted malt. Taste is an explosion of amazing flavours. Chocolate, caramel, liqourice, molasses, oak, some bourbon / whiskey notes and other herbs and spices. All of this is over a huge backbone of dark roasted malt. Aftertaste is bitter but amazingly delicious. I can see what all the hype is about. Can't wait to have it again! Have 2017, 2018 and 2016 (Scotch) in the cellar so might need to continue raising the rating.

Alt Platz Alt Kürbis Pumpkin Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Alt Platz Brewing Company;Terrible beer, with a very strong phenolic character, not due to cloves, but due to off-flavors from wild yeast, which the brewer tried to mask by putting a heavy coating of cinnamon and sugar on the rim of the glass. The phenols come through in both the aroma and the flavor, which was also the case in other AP beers. The beer was cloudy, with a sporadic head. Cloudiness bears out the infection. Two of us split ~a 10 oz pour, and we could not finish it. On top of that, we were charged $12 for this minuscule pour. The claim is that this price is due to the high alcohol level, which is EXTREMELY unlikely. Based on palate considerations, it is likely less than 10%, this is just a poorly made beer that the brewer is making excuses for.
Alt Platz Alt Kürbis Pumpkin Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Alt Platz Brewing Company;On tap at Alt Platz. 6 oz glass, part of the edge dipped in powdered sugar and spices. Murky chestnut brown with a beige ring of froth. First waft is gingerbread, thence on a wonderful amalgam of Christmas and pumpkin spice luring but not revealing the complete picture. Rich and smooth, mild carb. Wonderful to sip and savor. Cinnamon, ginger, cardamon, clove, mace and nutmeg are prominent. Hints of chipotle? A deft spice balance reminiscent of Pannepot. But this is a pumpkin beer and rightly so. Don’t think pie think baked pumpkin, earthy and fleshy, and thats what really makes this beer shine. An American classic.
Alt Platz Alt Kürbis Pumpkin Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Alt Platz Brewing Company;Virginia Beer Fest 2007. Hazy dark amber body with a small tan head. Sweet pumpkin and heavy spice aroma. Sweet caramel, spice and pumpkin flavor.
Alt Platz Alt Kürbis Pumpkin Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Alt Platz Brewing Company;I recalled this being listed as 18% ABV and now I see someone has changed it to 7.5% ABV. (NOTE: I now see where and why it was changed. I’m not sure why it lists the 7.5 % ABV on the website and why he told us that it was 16.5% in person unless there are two versions. I’ll try to confirm. UPDATE Got an email response from Tom. This batch was aged 8 months and came out to 16.5%. However, the next batch may not be. He will start brewing in 6 weeks and in 4-5 months, it will be ready and probably a different ABV. We can change it then). This was on at the Virginia Beer Festival yesterday (5-19-07) and the brewer, Tom, confirmed that this was actually 16.5% ABV in front myself, maniac and Cameron from Coastal Wine Connection. So I will be changing it after this review. Came out a thick muddy orange-rust color. Nose was powerful. Lots of spices, pumpkin pie, soft liquor and sweet malts. Maybe candied yams with marshmellows on them as well. Taste is bigger spice but it’s not overdone. Some soft alcohol, candy, sticky sugars and pumpkin pie. Body is medium-full to full. Soft carbonation. Very sticky but no warmth I could detect. Ends with more spices and pumkin pie with sticky sweet candyish notes. This went very quick once it was known to be out and the lines were large. Very well done pumpkin beer!
Alt Platz Alt Kürbis Pumpkin Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Alt Platz Brewing Company;On tap at Alt Platz served in 6oz glasses. Dark dark amber in color with a thick beige head. Aroma was full of spices (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, etc) everything you’d expect in pumpkin pie and lots of pumpkin aroma. Flavor did not disappoint, it was like drinking liquid pumpkin pie. This was by far the best pumpkin beer I’ve had.
Alt Platz Alt Kürbis Pumpkin Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Alt Platz Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub 6 oz glass. Dark brown color off white head. Very complex aroma and taste. No alcohol taste this one will sneak up on you. The best pumpkin ale, I have had.
Alt Platz Alt Kürbis Pumpkin Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Alt Platz Brewing Company;Right place, right time. Scammed some of Immy’s pre-release treat. After all of the seasonal & pumpkin ales I have tasted and frowned upon I wasn’t expecting to flip over one anytime soon, but this one was an eye opener, an awakening of slumbering senses. I think the brewer has his mother chained in the back making homemade pumpkin pie to mix in this brew. The golden-pumpkin-orange colored brew looked like pumpkin pie topped with a creamy off-white head like it was cool-whip. Aroma is every fresh spice you would expect in grandmas pie on Turkey day and then some. Flavor was same, spice combination perfectly complimented the pumpkin flavor in this soul warming spiced brew. Watch out for the alcohol because the high level is very well hidden making it easy to drink and yearning for more. Too bad for the rest of the world but due to the limited quantities only us few lucky locals will be priviledged enough to enjoy this outstanding brew. I know what I am doing for Halloween!
Alt Platz Alt Kürbis Pumpkin Ale;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Flavored - Other;Alt Platz Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. The owner gave me a sneak peek sample of this beer, to be officially released October 31. Golden brown with a big, thick, creamy beige head. Very complex nose - lots of spices, including (but not limited to) ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a light clove. Lots more, hard to nail them all down. An underlying pumpkin is behind the lush spiciness. Excellent, warming pumpkin pie flavors! Warming spiced finish, alcohol is present but VERY well disguised. Like a fortified wine, the nose blooms from the empty glass. Absolutely wonderful, the best I’ve ever had of the style. I’m no fan of pumpkin beers, but this is amazing. VERY well done, and thanks for the preview Tom!
Papago Aromatherapy IPA;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;on draft at papago. nose is a very fresh peach and pineapple hoppiness. flavor is the same hop presence but with a nice smooth malt sweetness. the only thing couldve used is more bitterness but nonetheless very good.
Papago Aromatherapy IPA;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;I will fill in the description later. I did like this beer and I saw no actual flaws with the beer. It was very much like the Four Peaks brewery Raj IPA combined with their traditional American-style IPA.
Papago Aromatherapy IPA;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;On draft at O’Briens, left over from Wet Hop festival. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Aroma is herby, with light summer fruit notes, a nice hop aroma with tangerine and lemon grass. Tartly sweet, with light toasty malts, citrus fruits, a bit of spruce and orange rind. Medium body, gently tingly carbonation.
Papago Aromatherapy IPA;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;Tap, O’Brien’s. Medium amber pour. Piney hop aroma. Some spiciness. Creamy hoppiness. Finish is somewhat hoppy.
Papago Aromatherapy IPA;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;Draught @ Papago. Dominant grapefruit aroma and fresh hop aroma. Dark gold/orange body with decent head. Flavor is like getting a can of grapefruit juice from grocery store without the acidity. Light bitterness and a good refreshing beer.
Papago Aromatherapy IPA;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;On draught at Papago: Pours to a mostly clear copper-golden amber colored body, with the lightest presence of haze. Head is small-medium, white, initially creamy & thick, though it fades to nothing within a few minutes. The aroma clearly shows fresh, juicy, wet hops. I smell grapefruit (though not in the usual dry/rind smell, more of a juicy pulp scent), orange, pine, berries, tons of juicy, ripe, floral hops coming through in the nose. The taste is bitter, though almost less bitter than I would expect from the nose, but then many of these wet-hopped ales tend to be that way. Much more floral and citrusy than bitter hops come through in the taste - grapefruit (again more juicy pulp than dry & bitter rind), very fresh citrus hops, not as much grassy hops as I’m used to in these which is actually a plus as it tends to highlight the more floral and citrus flavors outright. This one also has a clear malt profile that make it somewhat stand out from the crowd here. I pick up some nice chewy crystal malts, hints of light caramel, bread, and biscuit, and there’s even a slight yeast character here too - giving off a slight diacetyl flavor which I’m not sure if it’s due to using an english ale yeast strain of simply a diacetyl problem in the keg. Either way it’s complimentary to the overall flavor profile and not excessive here. Medium bodied, moderate, light carbonation, with the chewy malts making a mild presence felt throughout.
Papago Aromatherapy IPA;Scottsdale, Arizona, United States;IPA;Papago Brewing;Alpha King Competition: Nice caramel malt aroma on top of citrusy hops. Grapefruit and pine flavors were nice and fresh. Malt showed up in the middle. Moderately bitter finish.
Alt Platz Victory for Freedom Helles;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alt Platz Brewing Company;On tap at Alt Platz. Golden in color with an off-white head. Aroma was bready with a touch of hops lurking around. Flavor was a combination of yeast and sweet malt.

Had an hour to kill so I stopped by- Glad I did. This is a definate off the beaten path brew. A helles(german for clear) Not many styles like this one but rest assured it is grand! Pours a nice creamy white head with excellent release of aroma, fruity citrus notes- perfect carbonation, just enough to release the aroma- not soapy- first a slight hop bite then an overature of malty sweetness. With a finish that is to be reckoned wth. These go down oh so easliy- perfect compliment to the pretzels ordered with the brew, a salty sweet affair. Not had one helluva helles like this since Austria many years back. A perfect rendition of the Bavarian style. A must have again!!!! The Alt Platz , Das Güte Platz!!!!!!!!!!
Alt Platz Victory for Freedom Helles;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alt Platz Brewing Company;Draft at the brewpub, 10/28/06: Helles? This is orange-copper, the darkest helles I’ve ever seen. (Hey, call the beer whatever you want, but check a style guide. Auf Deutsch, Helles=Light, Dunkel=Dark). Again, zero head, zero carbonation. Almost like a sour orange soda. Unimpressed.
Alt Platz Victory for Freedom Helles;Portsmouth, Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Alt Platz Brewing Company;On tap with Immy at brewpub. Dark gold, golden ale, foamy white head.

King Arthur's Double IPA;Oswego, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;Very much like the Scotch Ale I sampled, this beer was a mess from the mash, very tannic, grainy/husky and astringent. The only saving grace was a heavy dose of citric hops, perhaps a touch of new mown hay, that helps to cover the mistakes in the malts. Hop levels not nearly close to DIPA levels, I should mention, but it made for good IPA level hoppings. Nevertheless, the hops don’t sufficiently cover the basic flaws in this beer.

King Arthur's Chocolate Porter;Oswego, New York, United States;Porter;King Arthurs Steakhouse & Brewery;An ugly muddy hazy brown concoction with a very thin off white head. A rather funky chocolate aroma with notes of yeasts, dried fruits and figs. In mouth, a dead beer lacking carbonatation, fails to enhance the chocolate malt, more into brown ale territory.

21st Amendment Friday IPA;San Leandro, California, United States;IPA;21st Amendment Brewery;On tap at 21st Amendment. Odd - this one is listed on the board as 8% ABV and as being dry-hopped with Simcoe, not Amarillo. Oh well. Pours a clear copper color with a nice medium-sized white head. Aroma is piney and citrusy hops along with some caramel malty sweetness. Flavor is about what you’d expect from a well-balanced west coast IPA. Some caramel malt, but hops are the star of the show. Citrusy Simcoe notes evident with grapefruit and orange, as well as some piney qualities. Medium body with very slight syrupiness and some mild palate-wrecking qualities. Overall a pretty solid IPA (or maybe IIPA).

Flavor is also hop-centric, again some light toasty malt sweetness, with massive grapefruit rind, spruce and lemon hops - a bit unbalanced for my tastes, but definitely a hop bomb. Light body and prickly / creamy carbonation.

Peters Malztrunk;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Monheimer Brauerei Peters & Bambeck;Hazy dark reddish brown, moderate head with decent lacing and retention. Aroma is sugary with fruits, only minor cardboard notes. Hard to find a lot of out the aroma though. Medium to light body with a sweet finish. The only low alcohol beers I have to compare this to are made by BMC, and this blows them away. Actually enjoyable. Bottle picked up in San Diego.
Peters Malztrunk;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Monheimer Brauerei Peters & Bambeck;Deep garnet, smallish off-white head. Fruity, rooty, sugary nose is not without a certain charm despite feeling a bit artificial. Quite good in fact, a bit soda-pop reminiscent, but fair flavours of various berries, blueberries, strawberries, raspberries.. Rather juicy profile with low carbonation. Obviously, it remains very sweet, but it drinks easily and I’d have been more than glad to drink this as a child.
Peters Malztrunk;Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Monheimer Brauerei Peters & Bambeck;(Draught 20 cl, at Peters Brauhuas) Clear dark red to brown color, brown creamy head. Extremely sweet scent, almost like it hasn’t been fermented at all. Very sweet taste, no bitterness at all. All in all it’s just very sugary. (The waiter at Peters Brauhaus told me the Malztrunk was indeed brewed by the same brewery that makes the Peters Kölsch, though he explained to me that it was a childrens beer and was very suprised when he realised I was actually ordering one to drink for myself...)

Nose is pretty much muted at first by the endless foaming (good retention too). Later it reveals to be very floral, citrusy and pine and honey induced. Taste is nicely aroma hop forward, smoothly turning into loong bitterin hop finish. Malt body is quite moderate, but noticeable. Sweetness balances the high carbonation.
Hoppin' Frog Hoppin' To Heaven IPA;Akron, Ohio, United States;IPA;Hoppin' Frog Brewery;Kirkas kuparinruskea olut runsaalla ja pitkäkestoisella tiiviillä vaahdolla.

Melko täyteläinen suutuntuma, hiilihappoja vähäisesti. Tasapainoinen ja laadukas IPA, joka pelaa enemmän tasapainoisella karamellisella makeahkolla mallasrungossa kuin runsaalla humaloinnilla.

Aroma shows roasted malts and an assertive amount of citrus hops I was not expecting. Bold. Flavor has a good amount of the Boris with the citrus/grapefruit bitterness coming through in the finish. The base is Boris for sure with the IPA lingering and giving balance. Not sure I would have blended these two beers together but the result is really nice.

Followed by chocolate & just a touch of toasty caramel. Flavor is well balanced overall, maybe just a bit too well. Although, a little IPA bitterness sneaks into the finish. Chocolatey & roasty flavors present in moderation, as is a light grapefruity hop, but it’s up front and doesn’t really last into the finish.

Deschutes Saison de la Bonde;Bend, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Deschutes Brewery;It was just ok. I expected more. More taste, more hop, I realize and appreciate that is crafted in a true old school not much added recipe.

Deschutes Saison de la Bonde;Bend, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Deschutes Brewery;On tap @ Bend, brewpub. I wasn’t going to rate this because it was so bad, but decided to warn people. Way over spiced, band-aid and a foul yeast character made this pretty much undrinkable. How could a place like this serve something this bad? Yuk!

Deschutes Saison de la Bonde;Bend, Oregon, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Deschutes Brewery;Draught at the Bend brewpub. A big surprise coming from these guys. I don’t even know If I’ve had a Belgian style beer from them before, and this was quite good. Poured a lightly hazy gold with a lasting, creamy white head. Big tropical fruit notes in the aroma with pineapple, guava, passion, and some lavender and chamomile as well. Lots of fruit juice flavors and some light pale malt, accented by some soft herb flavors. The finish is tangy and dry. Light bodied and clean on the palate with higher carbonation. Really nice bright fruity notes, and very well attenuated.

Scant spiciness in the nose with some doughiness and faint esters. The aroma is rather tame. Slightly hazy golden body with a creamy white head. Fruity estery start with some metallic hints in the middle. Tame banana-yeast esters later on. Light and watery, lacking body and complexity.

Saranac Bock;Utica, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a pilsener glass. The appearance was a stiffly looking bronzed burnt brown color with a ruddy transparency about it. Thin white foamy head that quickly dissipated. No lacing. The smell started off with some burnt caramel/toffee malts. Lights nuttiness. Some roast but turns into some toasty/breadiness. The taste was moderately sweet with that crisp bready/toastiness to it. Lingering sweet bready aftertaste, moderately sweet toasty sort of finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body. Good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light. Overall, its a decent bock, mainly nothing over the top.
Saranac Bock;Utica, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Amber to brown color. Not much dark malt aroma or flavor, though. Very malty like a typical heller bock, but with more hops than usual. A long lasting hop finish. Nice, though not too original. Hops added something.

Saranac Bock;Utica, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Very nice. The aroma is definitely malt dominant, with some sweetness, and some bready nose. It’s a dark amber color, with a thin head. It’s flavor is a bit safe, but the sweet malts and honey do make themselves present. The beer is a minor bit hoppy at the end, but adequate, not overwhelming. A nice session bock.
Saranac Bock;Utica, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"Bottle; quite a deal at 99 cents and it also gets me my second example of the style. Poured an orange caramel in color; nice looking. Aroma was pretty sweet, malty and bready. A little watery as others alluded to, but not too bad. Flavor wasn’t great; bread and honey with some peppery hoppiness. For me it wasn’t as good as the commercial description, but not as bad as some of the ratings here."
Saranac Bock;Utica, New York, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Medium-bronze color slight malt sugariness in aroma that translates similarly flavor. An easy-drinking, well-balanced bock that is a good intro. to the style.

S - toasted malts, hops T- Pronounced hoppiness (citrusy and piney) reflects Americanized ale. Both malt and hop flavors are quite evident, with hints of coffee and a slight burnt taste. Has a bitter and hoppy finish. M - thin for a beer this style; Moderate carbonation. D - more complexity would increase the appeal."
Saranac Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. This was poured into a mug. The appearance was a delicately bronzed to transparent brown color with a decent little white head. Moderate lacing. The smell started off with some roasty malts, light toast, some nuttiness. Then gets kind of dirty to earthy. The taste was mainly the same. Dirty/grassy/earthy aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body but has a really great sessionability about it. Boy, one could really slam these if they wanted to. Overall, it’s like a session brown ale, if there really was one. Hmmmm...almost makes me wonder if it needed more body, lol, oh well, not sure.
Saranac Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle from notes (2011 picked up at Kroger). Pours a clear brown color with a small off white head.

Saranac Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;The brown ale forms a thick light tan head that sits on top of a clear dark amber brew. The head makes nice lacing as it sides down the sides of the glass. The aroma is full of sweet malts. On the tongue, caramel and maple sweet malts give way to bitter dark chocolate and coffee notes. The palate is medium bodied and smooth with average carbonation. Saranacs Brown Ale is well balanced and very drinkable.
Saranac Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Not a particularly great brown. Mild and a bit too sweet. Nice appearance, medium bodied.
Saranac Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;June 2011 from bottle. Amber color, white head. Sweet malty aromas with caramel, spice and nuts. Slightly bitter finish, but nothing unusual or memorable about this brew.
Saranac Brown Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Brown Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"6/14/2011: Saranac Brown Ale... Aroma: Typical for the style. Appearance: Mahogany brown color with an average head of darkish beige foam. Flavor: Mostly toasted malts with dark roasted malt bitterness and a reserved sweetness; littler bitterness or hops shine through, but that’s expected for the style; pleasing nuttiness throughout. Palate: Medium-bodied; smooth; average texture. Overall: Soft, but decent Brown Ale, but not necessarily the best offering from Saranac. 12 fl. oz. bottle from Kroger in Harrison, Ohio. Rating #243 for this beer."

Aroma of prunes, raisins, grapes, figs, and other pitted fruits - potent sweetness and fruity notes. Medium-bodied; Assertive malty flavour with a ton of raisin and prune notes, a touch of grapes and light chocolate and finishes with a dry, musty malt flavour.

Overall, not such a great beer - but nice to try on the opposite side of the world, especially after a year and nine months time. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Slowbeer in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia on 31-December-2009 for AU$6.00 sampled on the opposite side of the planet at home in Washington on 02-October-2011."

Atomic Strike;Rugby, Warwickshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Atomic Brewery;Cask, The Victoria, Rugby. Still,clear,golden and lacy. Citrussy grapefruit hop attack on the nose with a hint of wet dog. Fibrous tropical fruit notes coming through (Amarillo). Muscular hop punishment to the point of astringency. Earthy, resinous IBUs belonging to a much stronger American IPA/pale ale...the description sounds great, and I love those flavours, but they’re somehow jarring and one-dimensional here. Nuthusk/peanut oil abrasive bitter afters. Malt drowned out by hops. Not quite there. (Cask, The Crown, Nuneaton). Massive musty green lime and grapefruit hop aroma. Waft of hutch. Aggressive hop dryness and husky dry roasted malt earthiness. Intense. (Back at The Victoria) Rabbit urine, celery and vanilla ice cream added to the blender. One of the freshest, most pungent hop aromas it’s ever been my pleasure to sniff- smells exactly like a freshly rubbed handful of those narcotic little cones. Church End used to brew beers like this. Outstanding sessions.
Blakemere Tomahawk;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blakemere Brewery;Cask@St Albans BF 06. Slightly eggy/sulfuric aroma. Balanced between hop and malt. Grainy hops, citric hops, earthy mouthfeel/flavour.
Blakemere Tomahawk;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blakemere Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) at St Albans Beer Festival, September 2006. Golden colour. The name suggests some US influence but I can’t say I picked up too much US hop presence. What you get is a dry, crisp and clean session bitter with slight touches of fruit. Not jam packed with flavour but fine as a quaffer.

Bushys Faerie Bridge;Douglas, Isle of Man;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bushys (Mount Murray Brewing);Soft creamy head tops a clear gold liquid. Soft caramel aroma with nothing else to mention. Flavour is tinny malt with a hint of donkey hair. Sharp weird funk aftertaste that does nothing for anyone. I need to finish this one quick as some guy thinks I'm ogling his fat girlfriend while she plays the lotto machine at this sleazy Isle of Man pub - like dude seriously, that land whale ain't worth fighting for. And for that matter, neither is this beer.
Bushys Faerie Bridge;Douglas, Isle of Man;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bushys (Mount Murray Brewing);Cask at the Southampton Arms on Christmas Eve 2010. Copper with a thin whitish head of foam.

Spitting Feathers Farmhouse Ale;Chester, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Spitting Feathers;Bottle conditioned (500ml brown bottle) session bitter, drank and reviewed Sunday 9th Jan 2011. Poured into an ’Abbot Ale’ glass tankard slowly, so as not to allow any sediment. I failed and a little got into my tankard, which means the body of the beer was contaminated with small ’yeast floaters’ and the light brown body didn’t look to great. My appearance score is low however because there was no head and the beer looked flat. A pleasant hop/mild malty aroma, nothing strong or in your face, just a hint of what is to follow in the taste. The beer may have looked flat but it certainly wasn’t, the body was in fine condition and was a lovely brew, well balanced and flavoursome, a good mix of the hops and malts coming together to produce a fine Bitter. At 3.6% ABV you are never going to get a rich heavy beer, having said that, this beer is a great example of a British session bitter and the depth of flavours often hidden within.
Spitting Feathers Farmhouse Ale;Chester, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Spitting Feathers;Bought from Wetherspoons in Stockport. I think the beer is off, tastes funny. Either that or its a bad beer.

Spitting Feathers Farmhouse Ale;Chester, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Spitting Feathers;Cask @ Winter BF Manchester. Had the Marble JP Best the night before and intended to start with it again the next morning, only to find it was gone. I wandered in search of a light hoppy brew of equal proportion but instead ended up with this, what a mistake. Golden with a only a white ring of head inside the glass. Smelled like an ashtray and the taste wasn’t much better. Bitter, malty and buttery with a hint of apple. Not a good start to the day.
Spitting Feathers Farmhouse Ale;Chester, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Spitting Feathers;A Mes rate: Gravicask at Manc Winter Fest. Golden brown, no head. Very rough unbrewed malt with much to obvious tea notes. Cleary not right and even if it was I doubt it would be great.

Exceptionally watery palate, fizzy. Nasty hard water taste. papery hops. Bad, and outragiously watery.
Lindenhof;Pécs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Pécsi Sörfözde;Lindenhof was added to the site on 26.10.2006. I get to be the first one to rate it. Great. Thanks to ogivlado for the tip on where to find it (he saw it in the window of the CBA Prima that’s on the corner of either Városház and Plivak or Városház and Pariszi streets but the store was closed that day), I REALLY hope I manage to get another can on my way back for him! Poured a pale yellow body with a medium-big thick white head that went away fast. Fizzy. The nose was actually more complex than I expected. Dust, vegetabley hopiness, malt. Ok for a Pécsi supermarket lager. The taste, however... oh the taste. Mineral water. That’s it. Prickly carbonation and not much else. Yaaaaaaaaay!

Welsenburg;Bõcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);No 790 Rated: 25.07.2009 Can 500 ml, rated in Bogacs, Hungary. Appearance: Pours pale golden, moderately to weak carbonated body with some sediments floating in the body texture, head is initially small, quickly diminishing but leaving some lacing traces, head is foamy, weak, non-stable, greyish white in colour. Aroma: Stronger but only a bit when compared with Greif from Ptcsi Sorfozde, in fact denoting more or less the same aspects, cooked corn, dullness, very weak due to being slightly watered down, poor in terms of wort extract, no hops, no yeast, no alcohol but only corn dominating over completely covered notes of barley malt. Flavour: Fornt is very watery, sour because of corn adjuncts, some artificial oriented hints of hops, alcohol is felt, metalic and mineral, salty and perceptably highly carbonated, cooked corn, some gentle tantalizing aromatic hoppy accents but too thin and too weak, totally no bitterness and no barley malt background felt, finish duration is short. Palate: Body is light, texture is watery, carbonation on palate is weak, finish feel is flat, slightly sour from corn, mineral.

Watery without any significant aroma except cardboard. Taste is similar to camomile tea exposed to the sun for at least 10 days. What a remarkable milestone.
Welsenburg;Bõcs, Hungary;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Borsodi Sörgyár (Molson Coors);0.5l can shared courtesy of and shared with ozujsko (thanks !) Poured a yellow-golden colour with a medium sized white head that went away fast. Fizzy. Surprise surprise. Nose... ooh, rubber... my, my. Why doesn’t that surprise me. A touch sourish too. If it smelled that good, you must be thinking that the taste was spectacular. Damn right it was. Watery, hints of rubber again, corn, cardboard. Just what I want in my lager. The Hungarian supermarket...beers? never cease to amaze me, and this one was certainly (hopefully) a unique experience. Not wanting to be outgunned by the Bosnian steel flavoured n/a’s, the Hungarians developed a lager that smells (and tastes) like rubber. Magnificent. It hit a new low with style. Borderless beer taste ? Let’s hope not.

The mild aroma was of polished rice. The thick mouth feel was vinous with a mellow vinous alcohol aftertaste. The sharp flavor contained notes of vinous alcohol over polished rice. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.

Messrs Maguire Porter;Dublin, Ireland;Porter;Messrs Maguire;2012 version on tap at Messrs (4.8% ABV). Pours deep, dark, murky ruby with thin off-white head - great lacing. Aroma is fairly subtle roasted, smokey malt, chocolate, and slight coffee. Taste is much the same with pronounced chocolate, smoked, and coffee flavours all combining well. A little bit watery - not quite as full a mouthfeel as I would like, but still a very decent and satisfying porter.
Messrs Maguire Porter;Dublin, Ireland;Porter;Messrs Maguire;"Deep brown coloured body with a thinnish tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee and some nuts. Medium-bodied; Creamy and roasty flavour with a nice bitterness at end. Aftertaste clean and sharp, but relatively nice. Overall, a nice break from Guinness, but the reminders of THE irish beer are still everywhere in this one! Definitely nice to try in Ireland. I sampled this pint on draught at the MessRS Maguire Brewpub in Central Dublin on 19-February-2009."
Messrs Maguire Porter;Dublin, Ireland;Porter;Messrs Maguire;Bottled at Stockholm Beer Festival 2007. A black beer with a brown shine under a thin brown head. The aroma is sweet malty with strong notes of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of roasted malt and hints of smoke from black malt, leading to a dry roasted finish.
Messrs Maguire Porter;Dublin, Ireland;Porter;Messrs Maguire;Draft at Bull and Cork, Dublin. The pour was dark brown in color, ok initial head and below par lacing. The aroma was milk chocolate and light roast. The flavor was milk chocolate first and foremost, light roast second, and a variety of lesser harder to detect hints of licorice and maybe some dark fruits. The mouthfeel was low on carbonation, somewhat sticky. Overall a sweeter take on the porter style, also not complex, but enjoyable (not sessionable: too sweet).
Messrs Maguire Porter;Dublin, Ireland;Porter;Messrs Maguire;Black, though with very little head. The aroma is quite mild. Dry, decent roasted flavours, coffee more so than chocolate, pronounced bitterness, but not to the point of being harsh. Medium bodied. One of the better Irish brews IMO.
Messrs Maguire Porter;Dublin, Ireland;Porter;Messrs Maguire;Draught@SBWF 2007 Dark ruby, almost opaque color, nice expresso head, some lace. Some roasted and papery notes in the nose. Coffeish, coffee beans all over. Clean, a bit lagerish product. Nicely drinkable.

Six Rivers Losen Frambozen;McKinleyville, California, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Six Rivers Brewery;Draught. Poured pinkish red with thin head. Aroma is raspberries set off with wheat malt. Flavour is tart raspberries. Doesn’t taste as strong as it is. Lasting fruity finish, with some tartness to keep it from being sicky sweet. Recommended.
Six Rivers Losen Frambozen;McKinleyville, California, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Six Rivers Brewery;GABF ’09. Pours a deep sangria red with a nose of raspberry filling baked atop a sweet pie crust. Flavor is like a frozen raspberry popsicle. Thick and lasting on the tongue. Yummy.
Six Rivers Losen Frambozen;McKinleyville, California, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Six Rivers Brewery;GABF 2009: Nice pale red color with off-white halo. Nice sweet, vivily raspberry nose but no sourness detected. Good raspberry flavors...this is a very nice fruit beer but i dont taste any of the claimed brettanomyces or much sourness or funk at all. But for a fruit beer, its quite nice.

Six Rivers Losen Frambozen;McKinleyville, California, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Six Rivers Brewery;GABF 2008. An intensely fresh raspberry nose, so fresh it reminded me of the fresh fruit cuvees we made at the Muddy Pig’s Belgian beer festival. The body was very tart and had a vegetal bite that again reminded me of incredibly fresh raspberries.
Miyanoyuki Junmai Ginjo Sake;Yokkaichi, Mie, Japan;Saké - Ginjo;Miyazaki Honten Co. Ltd;Bottle (assume fresh) consumed at Fugakyu, Boston on 9/30/06. Clear, but somewhat viscous appearance supports light legs that are not terribly large or sticky. Graceful, yet strong aroma is full of light, pear-like fruits, hints of tangerine and mango skin and very delicate phenols that contribute a spiciness on the end. Smooth and refined, it shows none of the alcohol. Strong pear and rice notes combine and strengthen as it warms. Hints of unripened plumskin and perhaps some vanilla are notable as well. Much stronger in flavor, though no less elegant, it boasts a warm, round, nuttiness, that also has hints of fruity sweetness and a white grapeskin tartness on the end, that combines light alcohol warmth with spicy phenols to balance the beginning. Thicker texture than expected, as well, with a palate-coating viscousness (which I’m overexaggerating, it’s not as if it’s truly thick or syrupy in the least) that really drives home the rice richness up front and allows complexity to emerge as the palate dries through the middle and end. Very interesting and drinkable, quite hearty for a sake. Rice sharpness and some acidity do build up over time, with increasing nuttiness and alcohol warmth.
Arcadia Cereal Killer Barleywine;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Arcadia Brewing Company;Bottle. Amber pour. Aroma of sticky caramelised malt, raisin, bitter pine, baked orange and grapefruit. Taste has sticky raisin, caramelised malt, bitter piney hop, orange, port-like ripened malt and a little yeast.

Very malty and fruity, very old school. Pretty solid, but unremarkable, old barley wine.
Arcadia Cereal Killer Barleywine;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Arcadia Brewing Company;Amber, with a little bit of haze. There's actually a fair bit of jammy fruit, and some piney hops. Tastes a bit old, maybe a bit flat. Touch of jammy notes, a bit harsh but maybe the bitterness has mellowed. Not great, old school, aged okay but just okay.

Flavors of toffee, sherry, dried fruit and spice with a crisp dry lingering dried fruit sherry finish.
Arcadia Big Dicks Olde Ale;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Arcadia Brewing Company;A fair Olde ale...a bit too bitter on the end for my taste. I hope to find a dated bottle now though as mine was not. I’m curious to try a bottle I can confirm some age on because I would definitely up my rating if the bitter truly does disappear with some aging. Though not the best, still by far not the worse Olde ale I’ve consumed.

Arcadia Big Dicks Olde Ale;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Arcadia Brewing Company;Tap at brewery. Opaque dark red. Really nice foamy head and Belgian lace. Sweet, cereal grain nose. Nice sweet malt without being cloying tempered by a surprising dry hop presence. Well camouflaged ABV
Arcadia Big Dicks Olde Ale;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Arcadia Brewing Company;Poured from the bottle of a four pack this is the 2010 vintage so we’re talking 5 year old beer. Dark brown with a lot of chunky foam. Taste is sweet malt and really boozy, maybe there were some hops used but I can’t taste them because it’s so sweet. Very strong like a barley wine. It says that this is 9% but I think the 5 years in the bottle has made it stronger. You probably won’t come across this in your travels but if you do be careful, it’s English and it’s rough. Not for the faint of heart.
Arcadia Big Dicks Olde Ale;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;Old Ale;Arcadia Brewing Company;Really malty and bitter flavored. Some caramel notes in this one. Bitter finish with some boozy notes. Pours brown in color with a thin tan head. Had at Arcadia ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Daleside Chocolate Stout;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Stout;Daleside Brewery;April 2007: Brown 500ml bottle, purple label, can’t find a best before date on the bottle. Poured into a Frankenheim Alt glass twice. If there is a darker beer out there, I haven’t seen it, dense and black, with a small bubbled rich light brown foaming head. Very strong burnt malt aroma, dark chocolate and treacle smells add to the malt, which gives the beer an over cooked chocolate cake aroma. This beer is what it claims it is, a smooth and creamy Chocolate Stout. This is what lets the beer down a little, it is watery for such a heavy looking and smelling stout. I enjoyed this beer, a pity about the mouthfeel, but drank with some Belgian chocolates made with beer (as bought at the Zythos fest), which I did with the second bottle, it stood up very well.
Daleside Chocolate Stout;Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England;Stout;Daleside Brewery;[Daleside Brewery, Harrogate] Pours dark brown with a yellowish head. Nose has some faint chocolate and a bitterness. On the taste - chocolate malt hints only, not as chocolatey as others I’ve had in the past. Quite light in alcohol so taste is pretty thin, some coffee in the aftertaste, which finishes quite smooth. I don’t think the three malts are that well balanced – and it’s just not that chocolatey [04092008]

Humperdinks Smokin Mesquite Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Humperdinks Brewpub;GABF 2008. Clear pale amber. Barely a hint of smoke essence in the aroma. Palate is thin and watery, flavours of caramel and cidery apple fruit. I couldn’t tease any smoke out of this beer. Disappointing.
Humperdinks Smokin Mesquite Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Humperdinks Brewpub;Clear copper colored body. Weird nose of butter syrup and burnt corn with some light notes of toasted bread crust and toasted barley.... nose is truly weak, the set up is quiet poor, but then it actually tastes pretty good and holds up well on the tongue. Medium to full body, well attenuated, has the right thickness of a true German smoked lager, but the flavor doesn’t seem to go anywhere. Very plain, mild and transparent all around... weak notes of burnt toast and charred grains. Disappointing.
Humperdinks Smokin Mesquite Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Humperdinks Brewpub;G.A.B.F. 2008: Deep copper dense light tan head. The aroma is toasted and sweet with some dough, brown sugar, mild smoke (peat). Interesting flavor. Brown suagr, toast, mildly sweet hickory notes and mildly smoky wood. Not a lot of smoke, but the flavor is unique with a very hickory like presence.
Humperdinks Smokin Mesquite Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Humperdinks Brewpub;GABF 2007. Pours to a clean filtered looking shiny fossilized amber body with a thin white head. The aroma is strongly mesquite smoked wood and pale malts. The flavor is kind of like a mesquite smoked toffee or nougat. Very unique. The palate is slick, lightly salty, and medium bodied.
Humperdinks Smokin Mesquite Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Humperdinks Brewpub;I raced over to have this once it was announced as a winner at GABF 2006. I figured a gold medal winning smoked beer must be exceptional, right? Clear brown. Nose is malty and sweet but only faint smoke. Taste brings a subtle smokiness and some burnt wood along with caramel and light cocoa. Body is medium with mild carbonation. Finishes with more caramel, cocoa and only faint smokiness. This wasn’t a terrible beer, but a gold medal winner?
Humperdinks Smokin Mesquite Ale;Dallas, Texas, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Humperdinks Brewpub;GABF 2006: Ok so this won the gold so I grab a sample. Mostly clear amber color. Malty aroma and flavor with some caramel notes and there was smoke but to me it was overbalanced. I thought there wasn’t enough smoke. The taste was fine but when I drink a smoke beer I want that to really shine. Jus tlike when I have a fruit beer.

Knappstein Reserve Lager;Clare, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Knappstein Enterprise Winery & Brewery (Lion Co Kirin Holdings);Pours pale straw with a nice floral aroma. The taste is something really different from what I’ve experienced with other beers. The savion hops bring a white wine taste along with floral and fruity notes, quite nice! The only real let down for me was it is over carbonated for my liking. Quite fizzy... Overall, I would happily have it again. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for Android
Knappstein Reserve Lager;Clare, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Knappstein Enterprise Winery & Brewery (Lion Co Kirin Holdings);Pours a crystal clear pale straw gold with a good head of white foam. The aroma shows nice sauvin white grape, biscuity lager malt, a hint of general fruitiness. The taste is very clean, grainy, fruity hop. It’s light on the feel, but flavour alludes to a higher than average ABV. It’s crisp and refreshing, not too dry, nicely carbonated. Great lager.

True: Smells like a fruity white wine. also picking up some floral notes. Sweet, bready taste with a smooth finish. Carbonation is a bit low. Surely not a ordinary lager, but not quite my style. Does’t mean it’s not good.
Knappstein Reserve Lager;Clare, South Australia, Australia;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Knappstein Enterprise Winery & Brewery (Lion Co Kirin Holdings);Smells like a Savignon Blanc wine! A lovely, flavoursome lager - probably the best Australian lager I’ve had. Slightly sweet, little bitterness, pale yellow, little head. Would benefit from a little more acid. A great showcase for the Nelson sauvin hops.

Sea Cider Pomona;Central Saanich, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider-Ice/Fire/Fortified;Sea Cider Farm & Ciderhouse;375ml bottle @ home. Pours a clear light copper colour with no head. Nose is lightly of alcohol, apple brandy with a hint of acidity. Flavour is mildly acidic but quite sweet apples with a tannic and tart boozy character. Medium bodied, mildly syrupy, no carbonation, very sweet with a mild acidity. It's OK but needs some refinement, complexity, and balance.
Sea Cider Pomona;Central Saanich, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider-Ice/Fire/Fortified;Sea Cider Farm & Ciderhouse;Bottle @ The Greenwald Residence. Amber in color with a pretty decent viscosity. Kind of a weird cider. Slight smoke. Very acidic and tannic, but also has sort of a jolly rancher/candy sweetness to it. Certainly some bitterness to the finish, which is very odd. Almost vegetal/celery finish and certainly some booze. Not sure I’m a fan.

Sea Cider Pomona;Central Saanich, British Columbia, Canada;Apple Cider-Ice/Fire/Fortified;Sea Cider Farm & Ciderhouse;Sample. Hazy deep copper red pour, dull color. Aroma is really off, light smoke, leather, cherry, rotten apple, what’s going on here, medicinal notes. Taste is sweet but also very acrid, bitter leafy notes, woody as all hell, as if they put the whole tree through the cider press. Palate is full bodied, lingering boozy finish. Definite drain pour, worst ice cider I’ve ever had.

Wilds Wild Fire;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wilds Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton.

Old Mill Halloween Surprise;Snaith, East Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Mill Brewery;Gravity Cask @ Highfield Inn, Beer Festival. Odd and not entirely pleasant nose, slightly fruity with some rotting wood. Unfortunate aromas fade leaving a mild hop finish which goes with the mild flavour profile. At best a little boring, otherwise verging on the offensive.

Mild inoffensive bitter. Bit of spice on end. Some orange/satsuma fruit. Quite full and juicy in mouth.Not sure where the surprise is.
Old Mill Halloween Surprise;Snaith, East Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Old Mill Brewery;Good copper colour, thin creamy head. In the nose, there’s a slight citrus hop with a hint of malt, but not much. Quite thin and lacking in taste: orangey hops but not much else, and I really didn’t get the chocolate. Slightly bitter. No surprise here, it’s just bland and boring.
Cazeau Tournay de Noël;Templeuve, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de Cazeau;2003 Bottle. Poured a mahogany color with an averaged sized head. Earthy, caramel, dark fruits, and yeast. Drinkable but past its prime.
Cazeau Tournay de Noël;Templeuve, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Dark;Brasserie de Cazeau;"Friday 1st Feb 2019; 7th Pre-Brugge Bier Festival International Beer Swap, De Bierboom. This is one of the many bottles that landed on my table for me to try, it is OK to take a decent sized sample (within reason) because there are so many beers to share. Deep Ruby body, beige head. Malty nose with some dark fruit esters also. The taste is also malty and slightly fruity with a fairy sweet flavour, nice slick body feel too. A very pleasant beer all round."

Flossmoor Station Harvest Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"Draft at FSRB. Now I’m told this is strictly pumpkin pie spice with no pumpkin. Hard to be sure from the color: a beautiful, deep cloudy brown with brassy highlight, like a varnished cabinet, and a brown-eggshell half-inch head. Big spices in the nose, perhaps a bit too much, but there’s a big foundation of malts to try and support it. Hoppiness, too, but not in excess. Can’t help but taste all the usual pumpkin pie spices, and somewhere, I get an impression of ginger, too. Don’t know how I can qualify a ""stunt"" beer from a place better known for its great regular beers. All I can say is, you gotta be prepared to drink this one."
Flossmoor Station Harvest Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Well, a day late and a dollar short, I too enjoyed this just after the release. Served with a light-hazed, copper body under a cream-colored head that held long and settled frothily. Despite bartender Becky’s observation that last year’s Peter Pumpkinhead was more pumpkiny, I felt that this year’s rendition held a fatter pumpkin character. Spices that normally overtake this style were in delicate remission as were the lagering yeasts that formed a hearty yet subtle backdrop. Yeasts and alcohol were forefront in flavor with tart pumpkin heart quick to follow and dry spices late. ABV dries the palate (maybe a little too harshly) but the spicy festivities were allowed to linger nonetheless. (Becky also mentioned she took pictures of Matt hollowing out pumpkins for last year’s brew and I might just pay cash money to see them!) On tap at Flossmoor Station, Flossmoor, IL 60422
Flossmoor Station Harvest Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;I missed the Mug Club preview at Flossmoor but, seeing RAYBOY01’s review, I thought I should stop by since I was going to be only a few miles away. Nice pour, a clear orange body with a good lacing, creamy white head. The aroma is softly spiced, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and allspice. A touch of toffee is added as it warms. The flavor has a solid caramel base to keep the spiciness in check, and it all blends well into a tasty Autumn treat. Nice. Flossmoor Station, Flossmoor, IL
Flossmoor Station Harvest Ale;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Other;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;"This autumnal specialty possesses a very deep orange glow with a medium creamy head. The nose was surprisingly subdued for the style, usually too over the top with ""holiday"" spicing. I detect nutmeg and cinnamon and a touch of clove. The first taste reveals a medium creamy body (almost like dipping into the first bite of pie and coming up with nothing but whipped cream) The cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, coriander, allspice are all intermingled nicely and serve as counterpoint to a touch of vanilla and maple syrup as well. Sweet caramel maltiness anchors the whole beer nicely. These can never be my favorite style of brew, but it is rather well done, considering the last-minute nature of the particular brewing circumstances involved here...Matt decided hurriedly to respond to several customer requests for another pumpkin beer and coincidentally a tap opened up because several of his special beers (Black Wolf, particularly) sold so quickly! Just proves once again, Matt is completely incapable of brewing a bad beer."
Williams Brothers Red with Elderflower;Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Flavored - Other;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Aroma is spicey hops with grass and biscuity toffee malts, with an intresting twist from the elderberry giving some lychee citrus flavours. Taste is similarly complex but a bit to bitter in the finish withoput a decent amount of dryness to justify it.
Highgate Lone Wolf;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in October 2006. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale copper red in colour with a thin white head. Floral hop flowers present in the short aroma. Thin but resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malts give a robust fiery digestive malt base with tart redcurrant fruit and burnt caramel. Dusty floral hops in the astringent metallic aftertaste. Finish is rather dry with golden syrup and malt extract flavours. A decent session ale.

Dark gold with a small white head. Served so chilled it was hard to discern any aroma.

Unterbacher Dröppke;Düsseldorf-Unterbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Vereinshaus Unterbach;Draught @ brewpub in Dusseldorf. Looking at the other reviews I no longer feel crazy. Pours was typical alt, with ruby hints and well clairty. Nose was rather floral, with some nice smoky aspects. Taste was alt in a sense but came with a slightly fruity buoyancy (from the other ratings I see I wasn’t the only one). This was indeed not a bad thing. Different and I rather enjoyed it. Some like apple or peach, and maybe a little bit of a dark fruit like a plum. The follow up on the palate is semi-sweet bitterness and soft. Enjoyable indeed.
Unterbacher Dröppke;Düsseldorf-Unterbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Vereinshaus Unterbach;I happened to live less than 2km away from this place during my stay in Düsseldorf, far closer than I was from the city centre, so I of course had to take the stroll to try their alt on tap. It shows a rather hazy dark amber body mounted by a fading off-white head. Fruity for an alt, this is almost cherry-like and the yeast breadiness almost brings it to pie-like level, but the sweetness takes a more caramelly orientation. Not quite as toasty as I like, but it develops fun nutty notes, rather almondy in character. Its fruitiness feels a bit tart in mouth, almost vinous and this interferes a bit with the hops that seemed to be pretty floral and aromatic for an alt, but now feel a bit subdued. Still, a rather wholesome, fruity alt, if not gloriously balanced.
Unterbacher Dröppke;Düsseldorf-Unterbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Vereinshaus Unterbach;Draught at the brewpub. Sweet malt aroma. A bit sour with a hint of diacetyl. Hazy dark brown/red colour. Small light brown head. Watery butterscotch flavour, some malt and a little aroma hops. Very fruity flavour, not what I expect from an Alt. OK beer, by no means overwhelming.
Unterbacher Dröppke;Düsseldorf-Unterbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Vereinshaus Unterbach;(draught at the Düsseldorf RB gathering) Hazy, amber colour with a small, slightly off-white foamy head. Moderately sweet, strong fruity aroma with a wide range of red berries to exotic fruits, accompanied with spicy hoppy notes. Medium-bitter flavour, light to medium bodied with a moderate carbonation. Initially malty, slightly toasted with a distinctive fruit-character and notes of marzipan. A bit slim but aromatic malty and herbal hoppy finish. Uncommon but pleasant Alt.

Smells big for a brown, with chocolate and American hops in the nose. Not that it smells really hippy, but you know they are there.

Watery coffee grounds like bitterness up front is a bit off putting to me, washed out malt in the middle, hops escape in the finish with a last minute citrus note. Average palate.

Tanglehead Pale Ale;Albany, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Tanglehead Brewing Company;Bottle. Lively pour, amber orange, off-white head requiring a pause in the pour to allow it to settle. Low aroma of toffee and cooked peaches. Similar flavour, palate is rather thin with low bitterness. Not bad, just thin and a little lacking in character.
Tanglehead Pale Ale;Albany, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Tanglehead Brewing Company;Poured hazy amber tending to bronze with a substantial loosely packed head that dispersed rather quickly. Aromas are reserved, dry grass seems dominant. Palate is a tad more complex. Some more dry earthy hop notes with hinting toffee from the darker malt. Finish is rather bitter and a tad astringent. Not a bad interpretation of the style. Kind of reminded me of hop back summer lightning, which isn’t a bad thing.

Tanglehead Pale Ale;Albany, Australia;Pale Ale - English;Tanglehead Brewing Company;This is the best English Pale Ale brewed in Australia. The Brewery has not been opened long. I was there about 6 weeks ago and meet the brewer. Andrew Larsen is a young New Zealander who set the brewery up and created the beers. Having meet him in person and picked his brains, I can tell why he has created such a good beer. Well done, keep the good work up.

Cucapá Barley Wine (Centenario);Mexicali, Mexico;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cervecería Cucapá;From a bottle, likely 2011. Aroma is fairly malty with a ton of caramel, toasted bread and toffee. Medium light honey and faint wet cardboard oxidation. No hop aroma. Medium raisin, sugar plums and prunes. Light alcohol spice. Faint hints of roast and treacle. Pours a cloudy, burnt amber with some brown colorings and a thin, tan head that quickly receded leaving just a hint of bubbles on the edges. Light lacing and sheets of alcohol, not legs. Flavor has a light sweetness with moderate malt character. Moderate caramel and toasted bread with lighter toffee notes. Faint roast and chocolate. Medium bitterness with no hop flavor. Medium light oxidation notes of wet cardboard. Light alcohol spice. Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. Overall an interesting Mexican beer, and likely the most flavorful I have had. The oxidation helps round the beer but also detracts with the wet cardboard notes. Lots of nice malt complexity. Very clean beer.

Cucapá Barley Wine (Centenario);Mexicali, Mexico;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cervecería Cucapá;Bottle from South Bay Drugs: I never even noticed this until it was pointed out to me by my friend but it sounded real good and like a real treat. The aroma is caramel based malt with a whiff of alcohol. Appearance is a dark mahogany color with a puffy small head which dies in a matter of seconds after the pour. Flavors are rich with sweetness and a bit of bitterness. Tastes range from a thick caramel you would put on a green apple to English style ale with cigar tobacco.

Murky brown umber body. Sweet aroma. Wonderfully malty sweetness with an alcoholic backbone. Reminds me a lot of that British barley wine with the devil on the label, whose name is escaping me right now. Bit of warming in the throat. Probably the best Mexican beer I’ve ever had!!
Cucapá Barley Wine (Centenario);Mexicali, Mexico;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Cervecería Cucapá;Cloudy orange brown color with little to no head. Big malty aroma with some oak, caramel and port.

Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;A shade darker Copper, Good Head, Some Lacing. Same as others from sample pack, lacks flavor sharpness. Bland and subdued. Tastes Malty, Light Bitter and finishes little sour. Enjoyed it the least from this sample pack. Drinkable, but meh... Pass it....
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Bottle. Bready yeast and barley malt aroma. Clear amber with a small white head. Bready yeast and barley malt flavor. Medium body. light carbonation.
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Bottle. Lightly sweet barley malt aroma. Golden yellow with small head. Sweet caramel malt flavor. Nice clean lager but not really any typical bock characteristics.
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Dark brown, almost opaque. Molasses, oatmeal, raisin, hint of walnut. Oily feel. Relatively sweet. Nice seasonal.
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Bottle, just said ’winter ale’ on the label. Light oxidized roasted and fruity aroma. Dark brown, offwhite layer. Fullbodied, light oily mouthfeel - quite a bit residual sweetness, nutty, roast, herbal hop balance - not entirely harmonious IMO.
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Bottle - Deep mahogany pour with a thinnish tan head. Nose is moderately sweet, bready malt, with a bit of molasses and next to no hopping. Taste is watered-down sweet bread, muted toffee and raisin notes, and a mildly sweet malt finish. Ample carbonation fluffs up the body a bit, but it’s pretty slick and thin. About what I expected.
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Aroma is malts, berries and an off note. The flavor is mild caramel malts, berries and a smooth finish.
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;bottle - Pours dark amber with a small off-white head. It has minimal aroma. The flavor is very sweet with some caramel. It tastes off though. I’m not sure what it is about it. I don’t think it’s infected, but whatever’s going on, it’s not good. Thin. Odd. Meh.
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;Cola coloured, fluffy tan head. Ok, here’s where it gets strange...I looked at the other reviews and mine is in left field.....maybe a bad bottle....don’t know....here’s my take: Aroma is spice and Tomato...Taste is vaguely like a weak bloody mary mix....That’s what I got out of it....I’m going to try another just to check myself. Strangely, it wasn’t that bad. That’s my justification for the mid-range rating. I’ll get back to this. TAKE 2: Different bottle, (of course) purchased at different location.....same result, maybe not as much tomatoe-zing, but it’s there. Other reviewers report iron and metallics, maybe that’s what’s throwing me off. I’m going to let this stand and try next winter’s offering.
Berghoff Red Bock Winter Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Berghoff Brewery Inc.;An unoffensive and forgettable brew, but decent enough to drink. Minimal bitterness. Mild maltiness. Faint notes of raisins or prunes. A little too subtle for me.
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Stale ash tray aroma. Murky yellow brown colour with poor head and lacing. Smokey stale malt flavour very unplesant. Flat palate.
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);"I just don’t get this beer; coffee in a pale ale... why? I’d much rather use the complementary tones of darker malts to showcase some coffee flavour. A weak coffee aroma with a touch of banana. Flavour mainly of coffee and some wheat grain character. Thin palate doesn’t carry the coffee well, yet some lingers longer than it should. Coffee porters may not be original, but the style works a lot better than this."
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Tried this in the middle of a long session - needed the caffeine hit. Surprised at the light colour. Coffe aroma and flavour apparent. Best example of coffee and beer I’ve tried, but not a must try.
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Aroma is a bit lacking with a touch of coffee and smells sort of like a Macro/Corn syrup based beer. Flavour is a bit wierd, it is a sourness with coffee floating in and out and slight nuttiness. Finish is has some coffee in it too, but again it seems to swing in and out rather then consistent and progressive. A nice experiment, but doesn’t quite pull off.
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);"A bit disappointing really as to my mind this beer doesn’t really achieve anything despite the coffee bean aspect. Pours like a macro albeit the dull orange haze gives the impression it wasn’t heavily ’cleaned up’ prior to bottling. There’s no doubting the bouquet; coffee chocolate notes dominate. Palate is definately ho-hum as the coffee, milk chocolate, cocoa etc, overlayed with a citrus note, looks quite awkward and unbalanced. As a few other notes have observed coffee flavours work well with stout or porter styles yet Malilda Bay has tried to infuse into a pale lager / pilsner format. It just doesn’t work at all."
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);On Tap, Balmoral Hotel, EVPk The Coffee aroma and flavour retention is great, with a real nuttiness and spiceyness coming through, not sure how it will last in the bottle, but is a great spacer beer on tap.
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);An unusual cup of Joe, this. Coffee-infused beers are fairly common, but they tend to be stouts/porters with strong espresso-type notes developing through a blend of beans and dark malts. This coffee-infused Australian beer brewed with pale malted barley and wheat sets out to be more like a caffe latte, or creamy white. It looks like a lager, albeit one of unusual golden intensity. It’s unfiltered, resulting in a very slight haze. The head is moderate but endures well. The aroma is where things get interesting. Close your eyes and you could be sniffing a robust porter. Dry cocoa powder tickles the nostrils, but it’s bedded in tropical fruity esters. It’s an odd mix - limey citrus and coffee beans. In the mouth, it’s a weird melange of pale ale and porter - a sort of Black’n’Orange. The first taste impression is of sweet ruby grapefruit hops and bubblegum but the Arabica beans fight for attention in the mid-palate and provide some kick to the swallow. The palate is thin with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry, phlegmy and fairly abrupt. It’s encouraging to see a mainstream Australian brewer break new ground but I wish the end result was more satisfying. One view would be that the reason this hasn’t been done before is that the combination simply doesn’t work. I thought this might make an accompaniment at a beer dinner but it’s hard to see where it would fit. On the plus side, I am feeling unusually alert after 500mls of this stuff. Might just skip bed tonight and go for a run instead. (750ml bottle from Liquor on Parade, Kingsford. Best before Sep 11, 2008)
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);In retrospect the best thing about this beer was the price. I was at the bar in Northbridge and after ordering an Alpha Ale I asked what this one was like. The girl gave me a sample of about 100ml, quite enough for a rate. It is quite pale and not what I thought it would be. Then the looks becomes deceiving card is played as I smell and taste it. Only a subtle coffee note but enough to give the game away. Look, in a robust stout this flavour works as it complements roasted malts and the bitter finish of a strong beer. In this it is just pretending to be a coffee flavour, like a decaf soy double latte. coffee shops call these ’why bothers’, I agree.
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Tried this on tap at the Queens Tavern a few weeks ago, served way too cold, it had a bright clear pale gold body with a decent head that didn’t want to hang around for long although it did leave some rings of lacing down the glass. Fairly light in body, nutty, very light coffee buzz on the aftertaste, bubblegum with mild carbonation. Some citrus characters especially on the nose. To me this is essentially a wheat beer for those of you who think they need their caffeine fix as well. Bring back the Barking Duck!!
Matilda Bay Crema;Melbourne, VIC, Australia;Flavored - Other;Matilda Bay Brewing Co. (AB InBev);Bottle (at Liquor on Parade’s tasting): Hazy gold with a thin white head. In the nose coffee dominates over some gentle grainy sweetness. However, it is the aroma of an espresso that has been left untouched overnight, a little off and urine-like, and quite odd. In the mouth things are much better - dry coffee beans (’raw’ my notes say) and again some grainy sweetness. But this is all there is, essentially a one note instrument, and there is a giant hole in both the aroma and mid- and back-palates. It’s certainly a interesting experiement, but I think it need some tweaking to really find what the strengths of this method of using coffee are. I’ve given this a slightly higher rating that I thought it was worth simply for being so unique. I like it when people push boudaries, even if they are little ones.

Haimhauser Schloß-Weiße Dunkel;Haimhausen, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Schloßbrauerei Haimhausen;"(bottle) Hazy, dark amber to brown colour with a big and tanned foamy head.

Adlerbräu Dellmensingen Brehms Edelbitter;Erbach (Donau), Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Adlerbräu Dellmensingen;00ml bottle (One Pint, Helsinki, German beer festival). Pale and uninteresting lager. Definitely not helped by it being filtered. Trawling for details you might spot some hoppiness and uninspiring malt.
Adlerbräu Dellmensingen Brehms Edelbitter;Erbach (Donau), Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Adlerbräu Dellmensingen;Bottle @ the German beer festival, One Pint, Helsinki. Not much taste, not much aroma, not much finish, not much else either. A mediocre lager, unfortunately there’s not much more to say. It’s pale yellow with a small head. Aroma of... well, nothing. Taste is an arbritary question, but there is some grass there. Hops in the finish.
Ursberger Klosterbier Dunkel;Ursberg, Bavaria, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Klosterbräuhaus Ursberg;Bottle. Dark chestnut, fluffy tan head. Fruity roast aroma. Medium light body, metallic dry. Roast grain, rust, light burned notes, roasted chestnut, fairly dry - as in lacking restsweetness - which makes it weird that it has a light sticky roast finish.

Hij komt van Kanegem;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Brown Ale;De Proefbrouwerij;bottle, very dark amber coloured with medium stable white head. Nice lacing beer. Strange style, is this ’brown ale’ ? I don’t know. Smell some industrial cheap, candy sugar, passion fruit. Taste: very fruity, some malty notes and nice hops. A bit heavy beer, may be a bit unbalanced but very special one and one of the nicest bottles ever!
Hij komt van Kanegem;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Brown Ale;De Proefbrouwerij;"Bright red-amber beer with a small beige head; medium carbonation. Very caramelly nose, with notes of parsley; bit of human sweat, coloured malts. Good dark malts returning in the mouth, and bitterish-bready(crust), without burnt, nor overly sweet notes - good balance. Dry hopping obviously worked, without conferring unwanted IPA-touches. Warming up, some less flavoursome oxydized malt notes. Medium bodied, slick, even refreshing despite the caramel overtones. Another one that is better than the sum of its parts."
Hij komt van Kanegem;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Brown Ale;De Proefbrouwerij;(Bottled) Very hazy red-amber with a largeish, tanned head with some lace. Toffee-caramely aroma with strawberries and some flowery hops. Toffeeish, somewhat acidic and mildly ashy-dryish flavor. Medium-bodied, quite foamy-carbonated palate. Not very clean or balanced, although decently drinkable. Label says it’s dry-hopped, but can’t find much hops here.

Simmerberg Dunkles Hefeweizen;Weiler-Simmerberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Aktienbrauerei Simmerberg;"Sorry for the german rating, but this is a lousy rating from my ""newbie"" time (2007-2009), and it’s not worth of being translated. I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Ins Glas ergießt sich ein nussbraunes, mitteltrübes Weizen mit prächtiger Cremekrone. Der Geruch ist röstmalzig, hefig und dezent nussig bitter. Der Antrunk erfolgt ebenso. Sehr lecker röstmalzig mit dezenter Schokoladennote. Dazu wieder die bitter-nussige Note, die das Ganze perfekt abrundet. Zur Mitte wird’s ein wenig hefiger, der bittere Ton geht etwas zurück, ist aber immer noch gut spürbar. Im Abgang kommt ein deutlich malzbitterer Ton durch, zudem eine saure Hefenote. Ein sehr gutes dunkles Hefeweizen, hier gibt’s nix zu meckern!"

Oberstdorfer Dampfbier Weizen Dunkel;Oberstdorf, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oberstdorfer Dampfbierbrauerei;On draught at the Brewery. The color is between a Dunkel and a regular Hefe. Not much of an aroma to be honest, a bit yeasty. The taste is a bit sweetish, some banana. Nothing wrong with it, but very middle of the road.

Oberstdorfer Dampfbier Weizen Dunkel;Oberstdorf, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oberstdorfer Dampfbierbrauerei;Thanks to quack-duck for that bottle. Looks really good. Beer in the glass fine turbid, nice head. Starts malty-yeasty, not too dry, fine fruity like banana. Modest sourish. Finish with some lemon hints. Well balanced and very drinkable. Nice!
Oberstdorfer Dampfbier Weizen Dunkel;Oberstdorf, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Oberstdorfer Dampfbierbrauerei;5l cask from the brewery. Cloudy amber golden colour, mid-sized, very creamy off-white head. Banana, roasetd malts, caramel, slightly yeasty. Not a classic Dunkelweizen but rather like a Bernsteinweizen or Ur-Weisse - neuther pale nor dark. Very well balanced, smooth palate with low carbonation. Delicious - any time again.
Mieghelm Gestels Withelm;Sint-Michielsgestel, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Huisbrouwerij Mieghelm;Draught @ Biermatinee Oisterwijk 2012. Hazy opaque yellow color, medium sized a bit creamy white head. Don’t smell much. Tastes a bit sourish, some fruity, orange peel. Quite balanced though, decent beer with a medium body and fresh finish.
Mieghelm Gestels Withelm;Sint-Michielsgestel, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Huisbrouwerij Mieghelm;Tap at KBC, Den Bosch: Simple whitebeer from this tiny North-Brabant brewery, its hazy, some spices, some thirstquenching.
Mieghelm Gestels Withelm;Sint-Michielsgestel, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Huisbrouwerij Mieghelm;Bottled. Aroma of grass and 7-up. Hazy, pale yellow color, white head, no lace. Light sweet, citric, light but nasyy bitterness, veggies, thin, very much one dimensional.
Glentworth Freeloader;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Golden with a small white head. Very sweet floral hop aroma. A little sweetness and fruit in the taste, but the mid section lacks impact and direction. Quite a pleasant lasting bitter finish.
Black Forest Smoked Hefeweizen;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Black Forest Brew Haus;Enjoyed a half liter of this one on draught at the brewery in Farmingdale, NY. Pours to a bright, golden color, with a nice white head, that faded, and a lively carbonation. The nose was inviting, with some light, salty/sooty smoke aroma. The palate is firm, with some good tart, wheat malt flavor, and a touch of sourness, that made this beer refreshing. This beer finished with some more tart wheat malt flavor up front, then ended with some light, salty and smoky flavor that lingered. Tasty beer, but it lacked the fruity esters of a good Bavarian hefe, and appeared not to be a true hefe, as it poured bright, and I didn’t get any yeast aroma or flavor. That being said, it was a tasty, refreshing beer, and I enjoyed the rauch malt aromas and flavors. A good beer that would work well with the German fare on the Brew Haus menu.
Black Forest Smoked Hefeweizen;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Black Forest Brew Haus;On tap at the brewpub tonight...A good beer overall. To me, it tasted much more like a lager than an ale, and certainly not much like typical american heffes. Very clean tasting, refreshing, with no citrus or too much wheat. The smoke is not very prominent, and just complements the flavor, which is slightly grassy and herbal. Nice.
Black Forest Smoked Hefeweizen;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Black Forest Brew Haus;"An interesting take an a hefe - much more lively, ""sparkling"" carbonation than your typical hefe, with an aroma that is much less dominated by the citrus and banana fruity esters than you’d expect, with just a light smokey quality far in the background - the flavor, much like the aroma, lacks those up front banana and clove flavors, which is a welcome change - there’s some light lemon, a mild bready quality, and a light yeastiness, with a very faint, but still quite present, smoke flavor - finishes fairly clean, almost like a pilsner or lighter lager - quite nice, actually."
Moylans Harvest IPA;Novato, California, United States;IPA;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;Amber with medium white creamy head. Slight fruity aroma. Good bitterness full of fruity notes. Slight metallic touch. Bitter aftertaste with some metallic notes.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Poured a virtual black color it ha small tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, bit of nut and caramel. Taste of roasted malt, some coffee and trace of nut. Nice bitterness and a dry finish. Fairly full body, with a bit of a grainy texture with a hint of character.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Dark black. Medium beige head. Really sweet. Tastes like chai. But as thick as I would expect with oatmeal. Subtle cinnamon. Interesting.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Had this at their tap room Fall 2012. Not really impressed with any of their beers. Not bad for this one.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Tasted on tap at the brew-pub. It poured an almost opaque dark reddish brown color with thin but persistent head of beige foam and a little lace. Not very stout-like. Not very toasty or roasty, very little oatmeal silkiness/creaminess. Tart, mildly fruity, acidic, dry finish. Just sort of a non-descript dark ale. Fairly smooth and easy-drinking but not particularly memorable.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Sample at the Highlands Brewery. Pours very dark brown and the aroma has heavily roasted malt. Medium/thick body and the taste has roasted malt. There is also some light fruitiness - like grapes? The finish has most other flavors dropping out except for the char. Not a bad stout.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Draft sample at the brewpub, the tenth of ten in our sampler. This one poured a deep, dark brown, pretty much opaque, with a small beige head. The aroma was pretty faint overall but I got some roasted malts, toasted oats, and earth from it. The flavor improved upon that, with more of the same notes, some light coffee, and a bit of cocoa. Medium-bodied, with average carbonation and a roasty, grainy mouthfeel. Along with the Marzen, this was my favorite from Highlands, and those were the two beers I felt were executed well. A good finish to the sampler.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;tasted 8/7/10. Sampler from the Brewpub. Opaque with a brown hue. Layer of khaki head. Aromas of dark roasted malts and a mild anise note. Hints of rustic breads. Rather full bodied with a great malt roast. Flavors of dark chocolate and cocoa dust. Mild coffee note without the astringency. Smooth body with a nice sweet flavor. Mild grassy hop note in the finish. Well crafted.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Sampled at the 7th Annual Parkville Microbrew Festival on April 24th, 2010. Pours black with a big-bubbled dark tan head. This has a wet blanket aroma. Medium roastedness. There’s also a big of smoke wrapped up in this. A fairly good stout.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;On tap at Highlands brewpub. Dark brown with some ruby lowlights and a thin tan head and a few spots of lacing. Aroma of roasted dark malt, mild smoke and a touch of grains. Taste of roasted malt, a hint of coffee but no real sweetness. Thin bodied and finishes up with some malt bitterness. Reminds me more of a dry stout than an oatmeal stout.
Kirkwood Station Oatmeal Stout;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. This brew is a brownish-black color with a medium tan head that diminishes steadily. Roasty aroma with notes of coffee and malt. Medium, smooth body with flavors of roasted malt, chocolate and a touch of black coffee. The finish is sweet chocolate up front with a lightly bitter coffee and hops aftertaste. Slightly above average overall.
Abbeydale Decadence;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Abbeydale Brewery;A dark chocolate brown coloured beer with a weak effevescence. A strong, perfumed, tropical fruit nose of lemon, mandarin and lychee, then a faint hoppy aroma. The taste is bitter, slightly sour, again, tropical fruit, lemon, grapefruit, mandarin and lychee, then a dry hop flavour, that is followed by a slightly sweet malt finish. The brewery’s 10th. anniversary celebration brew. Apparently dry hopped and with the addition of maple syrup in the cask (?!?!). (Cask - The Fox & Hounds, Heacham, Norfolk).
Odell Extra Special Red Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Odell Brewing Company;Fantasitc red ale with a balanced earthy malt base. Typical hop finish with a weighty body. Really good.
Odell Extra Special Red Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Odell Brewing Company;4/23/18. Reddish amber appearance with a beige head.

Odell Extra Special Red Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Odell Brewing Company;Aroma is malts, fruit and a mix of slight sugar and citrus. The flavor is fruit, caramel, malts, grapefruit/mild tropical fruit and a mix of whiskey/liquor and hops/alcohol in the finish.

Odell Extra Special Red Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Odell Brewing Company;Aroma of oak, vanilla, caramel, and light hops. Pour is orange and red with a lasting lace of off white head. I really enjoy the american strong ale style when done right, which this is. May not appeal to some as it is not hoppy, but this is a nice break from the styles I've been drinking lately.
Odell Extra Special Red Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Odell Brewing Company;Bronze pour, finger of tan beauty atop. Nose is deep caramel and understated cedar.

Odell Extra Special Red Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Odell Brewing Company;I sorta dig reds and this showed up at my best local shop, had to buy and try. The 12 oz bottle, Cellar Series/2018, is opened and poured into my New Belgium snifter, yep, red all right with a light tan foam rising to the top. An ipa-ish scent, okay start. Tasting now, ipa again, kind of woody, biscuit, a small caramel hit. Okay for sure, buy again? At the price I paid for the bottle, no.
Odell Extra Special Red Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Strong Ale - American;Odell Brewing Company;Bottle from Brewers Haven. Dark amber, crystal clear, instant foamy head disappears. Aroma is big caramel malts. Tadte too favors the malt, caramel and toffee notes. Mild sweetness, some latent barrel accents. Tiny bit of alcohol warmth.
Three Floyds Chubby Brown;Munster, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Nice malty beer. Pours brown with medium head. Sweet and malty flavor. Sublte cocoa and nuts. Light body and really drinkable.
Three Floyds Chubby Brown;Munster, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap @ FFF: Dark brown color with a nice tan head. Chocolate aromas a little roast although they aren’t too strong. Chocolate and roast domintate the flavor as well, definitely baker’s chocolate that dry almost chalky chocolate with a nuttyness and a chocolate roast bitter finish. Pretty tasty for a brown, although i wish it had a little bigger body.
Three Floyds Chubby Brown;Munster, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub: Hazy brown with a small frothy head and very good lace. Wow, a surprisingly hoppy nose backed by caramel, walnut, apple, juicy fruit, and grapefruit vapors. The flavor is fruity and chewy with a lot of malt background brfore a heavy (for a brown ale) bite. Finishes with a hint of mocha and nut. The mouth feel is resiny and dry with some snap on the finish. I liked it, not normal for sure.
Three Floyds Chubby Brown;Munster, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;this is a GREAT beer... this is my first rating too ... i’ll try to do well.... soooo sweeeet and tasty..... arrrrggggggggghhhhhhhhh..... 8% alcohol, and is soooo sweeeeet and tasty!!!!!!!! arrrrrrrrgggggggghhhhhhhh (did i say that already?) sorry, just had a 120 min. ipa and a dreadnaught......
Three Floyds Chubby Brown;Munster, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;No boring brown ale here! This one has a deep rich brown pour with medium tan head that lingers throughout. Very roasty flavors pervade...mostly chocolate and nuts, oh yeah...and a ton of PNW hop bitterness. Citrusy hop zest was a big surprise in whay usually is a very bland style. Quite well hidden ABV...I would have guessed more in the 5.5% range. Very nicely done.
Three Floyds Chubby Brown;Munster, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewbup. Pours and orangey brown with lots of dry hop haze, and a bit of white head. Aroma is typical for FFF. Buckets of Amarillo and Simcoe? Some light nuttiness. Same with the flavor. Just a shit ton of hops with some nuts and chocolate as it warms. Pretty easy to drink with along bitter finish. I personally would like a bit more brown ale charcter. Alway a pleasre to try a new FFF brew though.
Three Floyds Chubby Brown;Munster, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Dark reddish amber color beer with a big frothy beige head. Malty nose with hints of chocolate. Very smooth beer with a light body given the ABV. The taste is dominated by dusty bitter chocolate, with some raw grain and bready notes, and an almost cherry sweetness. It has the standard Three Floyds hop profile, but it is more subdued. You get chocolate burps instead of hop burps. I wish I could try the brown without the chocolate.
Three Floyds Chubby Brown;Munster, Indiana, United States;Brown Ale;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This was my first brown type ale and was very happy.It had malts and roasted oats roasted in their very own ovens.I had one sample and would like to try more .Alcohol is well hidden and beer is very smooth to the finish
Sail & Anchor Deneb;Fremantle, Australia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Sail & Anchor Brewery;I forget what the Deneb means, or perhaps I didn’t even ask. The S&A is one of those places you are attracted to because of the promise. It is situated in Fremantle, has an ample bar and possibly good food. The beers are the potential attraction but overall they fall short. For a black beer it is probably too pale, even though it looks fine in the glass. The head dissipates quickly but this is not as disappointing as the sweetness and cloying overbalance of sweet malt to the hoped for burnt flavour of black malts. OK, but only enhanced by the company, Bluevegie and my work colleague Petra.

The aroma is all about resin and rich caramel. Full-bodied with an ultra-creamy mouthfeel and reserved carbonation. Leans on the sweet side of balance, but not by much.

Fine with curries though. // Rerate new bottle 2ß18-4, merci Miles. Commerative Dave Wickett pours this time. Hard to put my fingers on why, but I like this more than I rated it as: could be the sub-5% easygoing lemon goodness...
