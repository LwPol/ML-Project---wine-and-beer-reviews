Das Bierhaus Black Bear;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Das Bierhaus;On tap at the brewpub. Aroma of toasted malt and coffee. The color is pitch black, no light coming through. Taste is of dark, roasted malt and coffee-ish overtones. Overall, an excellent example of this style. More body and mouthfeel than a Köstritzer Schwarzbier, but not thick or cloying.
Das Bierhaus Black Bear;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Das Bierhaus;On tap at the brewpub - Pours opaque black with a foamy light tan head. Smells huge and malty, with some coffee and dark chocolate, with some dark bread in the background. Taste is smooth, considering all the flavors mixing here. Chocolate comes through a lot more, and there’s a touch of smoke in there, with a clean finish. Powdery mouthfeel, and not too heavy. Very, very good stuff.

Das Bierhaus Black Bear;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Das Bierhaus;Sep 29, 2007 Draught at the brewpub. The beer was opaque black with a moderate amount of head. Burnt malt was the dominate flavor and aroma in the beer. Mildly sweet. Very drinkable for a Schwarzbier.
Das Bierhaus Black Bear;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Das Bierhaus;Thanks to my wife Heather for picking me up a growler (while in Menomonie) that I shared with friends after a night of bowling. Powerful roast aroma, with some hints of charcoal as well as light hops. The knock on this beer is that it is slightly one dimensional. However, that dimension is extremely well done. Great stuff.

Pours a clear, dark brunette with a reddish hue. Large amount of light brown head. Tight bubbles. Produces extensive lacing. Great looking beer. Sharp coffee flavor, as one would expect given the smell. Some citrus. Hoppy. A touch of softer, dunkel-like flavors. Also a bit of dark chocolate and sugary candy sweetness. Light to medium body.

Das Bierhaus Black Bear;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Das Bierhaus;If it wasn’t for Skyview, I wouldn’t be able to keep drinking magnificent beers from this slice of Germanic heaven. Black color with a thick head. Light aroma of slightly burnt malt. The taste keeps up the burnt, almost charred, malt profile. Very chalky mouthfeel. Slightly salty finish. Good lord, I could drink it by the gallon.
Brahma Porter;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Porter;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);Not too bad really, kinda schwarzbier-ish. Some good caramel malt. A little bit of garbage in there.

Brahma Porter;Quilicura Santiago, Chile;Porter;Cerveceria Chile S.A. (InBev);(Can). Dark brown colour with a small beige head. Aroma is mostly of toasted malt, sugar, candy and that’s it. Sweet flavor with some notes of chocolate and alcohol. Medium body, but gets watery in some parts. Not as drinkable as the Stout.
De Proefbrouwerij Signature Ale;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;50% off on clearance...otherwise would have probably not have ever tried this for $15. I am thinking that this maybe sat too long, as seemed on the flatter side....maybe balance off a little leaning towards the sweet side. I can tell that the flavor is there....fruit/tart, earthy, some hop...typical Belgian flavors. Once past the mouthfeel, it is a decent beer. Appearance is murky medium brown, kinda like swamp water or a dark apple cider with zero head. After reading these reviews I really do think the bottle was bad, as I figured aging a bit wouldn't matter with this one.
De Proefbrouwerij Signature Ale;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;Sampled from an 11.2 oz brown bottle this beer poured a murky brown color with a medium sized creamy off white head that lingered and left decent lacing. The aroma was sweet with bread dough, honey, caramel, fig and vegetal malts. The flavor was sweetish, bitter, astringent, medicinal, perfumey, chalky and vegetal. Very long finish of rancid vegetable soup. Pretty disgusting.
De Proefbrouwerij Signature Ale;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;De Proefbrouwerij;Leans sweet like most Belgium ales. Pale brown and clear color. Solid head. On closeout. Retailer says big bottles are losing compared to cans.

Ume No Yado Hoshiusagi (Star Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;"Poured into flute. This is for people who don’t like sake. Pours out a purple colour with blueberry scent. The blueberries were a little too much for me but they seemed ""real"" not a chemical flavouring."
Ume No Yado Hoshiusagi (Star Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Bottle: Pours a ruby red color with a nice pinkish head, fairly carbonated for just sparkling, even holds together too. The nose is fruity and light with the typical koji and alcohol note you always get with a cheaper base sake watered down to this low of a percentage. Obviously this stuff was bad, BUT the blueberry does meld things together with some love. Fresh berry flavors with a sweet (-30) flavor yet a tart berry note that balances it. The finish is clean and refreshing. You want to think of fruity soda pops or something, but there’s still some sake taste in there. Worth a once over.

Sprague Farm Kick Bock;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;They call this a Heller Bock? Doesn’t Helles mean light? This is more in line with a doppelbock except that it doesn’t taste like one either. Tastes of caramel dominate the flavor profile, more like a porter, certainly not like any bock I’ve had.
Sprague Farm Kick Bock;Venango, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sprague Farm & Brew Works;On tap at the Bocktown. Cloudy dark brown with a big foamy head. This almost looks like a weizen bock. Not too sure if it is truly opaque but it is getting there. Slightly roasty aroma but the smell is barely detectable. Initially the taste comes on like a stout, almost impy stoutish. Then the flavors meld into that typical bock characteristic. Interesting evolution of flavors. The bock flavors then proceed to overwhelm the palate. Roasty, then alky malty bitterness. However, the bitterness is not excessive like many bocks. This stuff is more like a mild impy stout or baltic porter than a bock. Mild carbonation. Quite surprising. If you like baltic or impy stout, give this a try just for the fun of it. Medicinal bitter lasting finish.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Summer Bock;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Did you ever check out how messed up the listings are for the Rock Bottom brews? Terribly confusing! On tap at the Pittsburgh Rock Bottom. Sweetish plastic aroma. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color. Laid back flavor at first but then the alky impact develops and gives you a slight alky wallop. It fools you into thinking it is mild then the impact occurs, quite interesting. Alky impact slowly builds with each sip. This light colored bock is OK but you certainly can tell the alky content is higher than most of the brews at Rock Bottom. Leaves a medium alky bitterness as a finish that hangs for a while after the last sip.

J.T. Whitneys Blond Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;J.T. Whitneys Pub & Brewery;On tap at brewpub Once they gave me a pour that was worth drinking this did not turn out so badly. The first pint was a horror story though. It arrived just as the tap line was being replaced (but not cleaned). As a result I got 12 ounces of sediment. You’d think the bartender would have noticed. At least they were prompt in bringing a new one. Aroma / Appearance - A one finger white head balanced on the top of an orange colored body. Grapefruit, pine, lemons and orange rinds highlight the nose which also is supported by a basic maltiness blended in caramel. It’s not exceptionally complex but it is good enough. Flavor / Palate - Pine and grapefruit reveal the hoppy nature of this beer. Caramel unfolds as the chewy mouthfeel fills every crevice of the palate. I am reminded most of orange liquer but with a yeasty aftertaste. It tastes pretty good especially when you get a pour that is not 95% chud.

Big Bear Mountain Orange Blossom Amber Ale;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;[Tap @ Brewery] Orange all around. Lightly hazed orange appearance, lots of orange sweetness on the nose. Lightly malty, a touch bready, strong orange flavor. Very light ale, not sure why they’re calling it an amber. Orange is both the strength and its weakness in that it’s a little overdone - especially ahving seen a better and more crafty example from Hangar today.
Big Bear Mountain Orange Blossom Amber Ale;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Served on tap at Big Bear Mountain Brewery. The appearance is a slightly hazy golden orange hue. The aromas are strong with a McDonald’s Orange Drink aroma that takes me back to me T-ball days. I dig it. The flavors have a powdery orange taste that runs through the beer. Light hop additions. If you like fake orange drinks you’ll love this brew. The mouth is nicely carbonated (unlike most of their beers this evening). I enjoyed this one.
Big Bear Mountain Orange Blossom Amber Ale;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;A: The pour is a hazed light orange/amber color with no head to speak of. S: This beer stings the nostrils, and not in a good way. Paint thinner, orange rinds, and Vick’s Vapor Rub work well to clear a sinus problem but aren’t really what I look for in a beer. T: This is what a mixture of orange peel infused cologne and Vick’s Vapor Rub would taste like. Simply dreadful and it burns a little bit. M: The body is thin with almost no carbonation and an intense heat as though taking a drink of liquor. D: Truly dreadful. This might be good for a head cold, but it’s nothing I would ever wish to drink again.

Big Bear Mountain Lil Beaver IPA;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;IPA;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Served on tap at Big Bear Mountain Brewery. The appearance is a slightly hazy gold hue with a micro white head, a little darker then the Pale Ale. The aromas are also stale. The flavors are the same. Oxidized, mild stale malts. When I first tasted my buddies I though they acidently gave him the Pale Ale but the IPA is even less hoppy then that. Sad. The mouth is pretty still. This beer too has seen it’s better days.
Big Bear Mountain Lil Beaver IPA;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;IPA;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;A: The pour is a golden amber color with a small white head and some spots of lacing. S: A pretty decent hop aroma to this beer, which is mostly oranges (seems like a popular theme at this brewery). There are some hints of pine, but otherwise it’s sweet and bready malt. T: The flavor is quite bitter, much moreso than I would have expected from the nose. Most of the hop flavor is in the form of bitter orange and grapefruit peels. M: The body is on the light side of medium with a low carbonation. D: This is one of the better beers from these guys, but that’s not really saying too much.
Big Bear Mountain Lil Beaver IPA;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;IPA;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Draft. Name of beer was Little Beaver IPA. Amber beer with an off-white head. Low grapefruit aroma. Grapefruit and light malt flavor. Medium bodied. Low bitterness. Light grapefruit and light malt lingers.
Big Bear Mountain Lil Beaver IPA;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;IPA;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Pours with an amber body topped by a thin to medium thick head with some lacing left on the glass. Slightly sweet and malty yet well balanced with bitterness and a subtle citursy hop note. Very refreshing. Medium bodied, smooth and a touch dry.
Big Bear Mountain Lil Beaver IPA;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;IPA;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;Clear orange amber with foamy white head. Faint malty aroma. Creamy mouth feel. Tart citrus taste but lacking the hoppy bitterness to back it up.
Big Bear Mountain Lil Beaver IPA;Big Bear Lake, California, United States;IPA;Big Bear Mountain Brewery;A malt dominated nose with some earthy and grassy hops. A little pine, but faint amounts. Pours a murky darkish amber. Flavor is caramel and toffee malt dominted followed by some earth and pine hops. This is definitley a more malt based IPA. It is pretty heavy in body and the alcohol is detectable to a certain extent. Not bad, but I like my IPA’s to be more on the West Coast style.

Gyumri Lager (Rigayi);Gyumri, Armenia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Shirak Gyumri Beer-Malt Factory CJSC;50cl bottle at my hotel room in Yerevan. Pours pale golden with a small white head. Standard industrial lager. Sweet, lightly malty and drinkable, but not worth bringing back home. Backlog from Armenia trip in 2010 - tasted: 2010-06-01

Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;Bottle sample at a beerandbeyond speciality beer tasting. Pours murky dark brown with a quick dissolving off white head. sugar, chalk, kvass and grape juice aroma and a way too sweet taste. Weird fizz, medium body, caraway aftertaste. Weird, disgusting taste, but I was expecting the worst.
Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;Tan head over clear deep-red body. Aroma of Sweet malts and cardboard. Taste... Like two day old caraway bread. I assume that was the point, and I think if it were baked it might be good. As a beer it sucks, though.
Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;This beer smells like brown bread and tastes great. There is nothing ordinary about this beer.
Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;Starker Kräutergeruch, Kümmel kristallisiert sich logischerweise heraus. Auch im Geschmack dominiert das Aroma, darunter ist eine unpassende Süße zu erkennen. Die groben Aromenzüge scheinen noch nicht ausgereift, und so fehlen Details, das Bier wirkt etwas lieblos - aber interessant! Danke an Barak!

Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;Dark red to amber quite hazy with small off white head, aroma of caraway grass and some sweet malt, flavor of caraway white wine, unpleasant sourness, no hop, bad taste.
Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;Bottled@omhper. Hazy ambery brown colour with small white head. Aroma is ryebread made into liquids along with some slight fruity notes. Flavour is the same as well as a lot of herbs and spices. Strange, but pleasant.
Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;Bottled, thanks DSG! Cloudy mahognay colour, minimal head. Strong caraway aroma. Sweet and fruity. Bready with a flavour of caraway all the way. Doesn’t have the phenols and medicinal notes of the other Canaan beers, and the caraway is defnitely a unique thing. Still not world beater.
Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;0,33l bottle, bought by my wife at a café/shop somewhere between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Color is a bit muddy, lame head. Nose is filled with herbs and - surprisingly - caraway. This is quite a challenging beer, and not necessarily in a good way. In my opinion the brewery could have focused on some other spice - it is rather obvious that caraway does not suit beer.
Canaan Caraway Beer;Kfar Adumim, Palestine/West Bank;Flavored - Other;Canaan Brewery;0.75L bottle. Murky brown colour, small head, very pronounced sourness, distinct flavours of caraway, intresting but not too appealing, the sourness and the caraway do not meld together and each one stays distinctly apart. I do no think that caraway in a beer is a match made in heaven.
Kern River Anniversary Ale;Kernville, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kern River Brewing;Bottle, thanks to Doodler. Very much a gusher here, showing it’s age, I suppose... Nose is lightly grassy, with caramel and hay, and light bready notes,as well as something lightly funky. Doughy florals are easily picked up with further nosing. Flavours of round barley, some funky yeast, very bready/yeasty, some soap,some citrus, some soap. banana, rather like De Dolle Arabier here... Possibly infected, but very tasty regardless.
Kern River Anniversary Ale;Kernville, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kern River Brewing;Pours a slightly cloudy orange color with a gushing thick off-white head that disspates very slowly. Not a good sign. Sticky small patches of lacing. Aroma of yeast and tropical fruits. Light to medium body with flavors of sweet fruit, yeast and malt. The finish is short and fruity. It is pretty safe to say there is something off with this bottle. Just average regardless.
Kern River Anniversary Ale;Kernville, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kern River Brewing;Bottle from a generous trader. Pours orange with white frothy head. Nose of kiwi, pear, lemon and peel. Taste of farmhouse fermented fruits and candy sugar.
Kern River Anniversary Ale;Kernville, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kern River Brewing;Bottle thanks to Jake65. Pours out golden yellow topped with a small cream head.

Kern River Anniversary Ale;Kernville, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Kern River Brewing;had to let breathe for awhile. may have had an older bottle. nice light golden ale with a good carbonation level. easy to drink. a starter Belgian. a bit of spice to it to make it a little more complex than a plainer beer.

Appalachian Vanilla Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On draft at the Collegeville pub. This was a decent porter, but I didn’t get enough vanilla to support the name of the beer. I tasted more chocolate and coffee than I did vanilla. The pour was basically black in color, but didn’t come with any type of head. Most of the vanilla shows through toward the finish of the flavors and in the aftertaste. I also got a somewhat smokey flavor in the finish. Not a bad porter, but probably one that I wouldn’t order again.
Appalachian Vanilla Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at ABC Collegeville. Pours turbid blackish brown with tan head. Nose was vanilla, roasty malt. Tasted malty, with a pronounced and well integrated vanilla flavor, and a smooth finish. This one reminded me a lot of the old Sunnybrook vanilla porter that was brewed by Bill Moore (now Lancaster Brewing head brewer) during his tenure under Henry Ortleib at the Sunnybrook Ballroom in Lower Pottsgrove.
Appalachian Vanilla Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft. Deep brown, medium body but not good finish. Otherwise a nicely flavored porter of vanilla.
Appalachian Vanilla Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);The vanilla nose worked well with the roasted barley for a really nice beer---although a little lighter than I would have preferred, it was delightfully satisfying after a day of hiking on the battlefield.
Appalachian Vanilla Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);i thought this was not all that great not fror $5 a pint, body was real thin, had an allright vanilla roast taste to it, but i didn’t dig it at all.
Appalachian Vanilla Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Brown, moderatly dark but lighter than expected for a porter. Light brown head. Light vanilla bean and mocha nose. Heavy roast tasted. Pasty palate. Lacks depth and complexity, just a plasticy, moldy charred grain flavor with very light vanilla, but what is there actually tastes like French Vanilla ice cream. OK overall.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at ABC GBurg. Clear golden thin white head. Minimal nose. Very sweet and cloying. Not what I’d consider to style.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at ABC Collegeville. Pours clear light gold with white head. Nose was pale malt, mild hops, butterscotch. Tasted of pale malt, mild hops, and a definite buttery flavor and finish. I hope this is not a trend, as the last 3-4 new beers here have been terrible. Earlier Rating: 9/4/2008 Total Score: 3.2 Poured deep gold with creeamy white head. Nose was grainy pale malt, mild hopcitrus, mild fruit. Tastes crisp, not hefty of palate, with fruity, lemongrassy hopcitric, and bready pale malt flavors, with decent balance. A good example of this style.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);[Collegeville] Golden color with a small, white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of butter, diactyl, toast, grass, light citrus. Taste of toaste, light toffee, faint bitterness, more diactyl in the finish.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at the brewery. Very mild pilsner malt aroma with a bit of mild fruity hop character. Golden amber clear with thin head. Medium body with medium-light carbonation. Starts sweet with some corn and DMS. A bit watery. Not very crisp. Decent flavor but not really reminiscent of a kölsch.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Gold pour with off white head and lace. Aroma of light sour malt, paper, and perfumy hops. Sweet caramel malt start, perfumy hops, medium bitter, and a dry finish. Medium bodied and fizzy.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);This is not a very Kolsch-like beer at all, let alone a very drinkable one. It poured a hazy and cloudy golden color with virtually no head and no lacing. The aroma was almost non-existant. The flavor was overly fruity with no hoppiness to speak of. The finish tasted like strawberry Pez. This was truely an undrinkable and nasty beer.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);hazy yellow, borderline cloudy. Aroma is sweet grain. Flavor is grass, hay, slight wheatiness even. Light bodied but flavorful. An excellent kolsch.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);On tap at the brewpub. Pours a glowing gold with a medium sized white head. Citrus, crisp grain. Medium bodied, and grainy. Sweet, fruity, with some empty grain flavors and crackers. Soft sweet apple finish.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at the brewery. Like their lager, this was nice for its type. Crystal clear gold, small head, surprisingly good lacing, more like a cask than a keg in mouth and appearance. Not much happening in the nose. Taste has grassy notes, a little pale malt, a little hoppy bitterness, in good balance. Long bitter finish.
Appalachian Dom Blonde Kölsch;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Location: Tap at the Brewpub, Harrisburg location, 6/13/10 Aroma: It has grains, honey, and corn on the dull nose Appearance: Has a clear orange-gold look to it Flavor: The taste is light sweet, not much else, similar flavors to the nose Palate: It has a fairly light body Overall Impression: This was pretty boring stuff, overall. Oh well...
Cornerstone Eden;Berea, Ohio, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Cornerstone Brewing Company;Pours a slightly hazy amber. The flavor is actually fairly tart with a little Belgian yeast funk. The aroma is full of sweet fruit.
Thomas Hooker Oak Aged Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Draft at Barcade. This was like my fifth or sixth beer, so I don’t remember it too much. It was oaky.
Thomas Hooker Oak Aged Liberator Doppelbock;Bloomfield, Connecticut, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Thomas Hooker Brewing Company;Draft at Hop Devil. Apparently this was the only keg made. Mildly oaky, vegetal aroma, complimented a wet, veggie taste. Slight oak in the finish. A bit pungent, tough to drink, and unexciting. I think the benefits the oak imparted on this beer were far less than the hit this beer took from aging -- that is, losing most all of its character. Some beers were not meant to be aged: this is one of them.
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear gold with a medium sized white head. Sweet honey and a hint of lemon on the nose, a touch of musk. Medium bodied, soft fruit, a bit of musk, not overly sweet, but has a thick sot of mouthfeel that makes me think of something a bit sweeter. Slow gentle bitterness into the finish.
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;Bottle. Thought I was buying the DuPont beer. Ugh... Hazy copper with a small white head. Aroma is honey, floral, cardboard. Flavor is sweet, honey, grain, some floral. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Ok...
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;Bottle from BevMo! in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is sweet flowers, mild honey, bread, some Belgian yeastiness. Taste is light honey and a very mild Belgian. Gets better as it warms. Like a Kolsch meets a Belgian blonde.
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;My go to beer when visiting the Tasting Room. They will serve it in the correct glass for you, if you ask. It is a ’Braggot’ so there is honey in it.
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;Sweet and cidery. Taste of fruite. Nice once and awhile but not all the time. Poured into a pint glass
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;On tap @ Rabbits Foot. Clear golden straw pour with a white head. Mostly bready malt and a little bit of biscuit, dough, and cereal. There’s a bit of a paper/cardboard thing to it. A lot of bread, sweetened cereal, and some grass. A light bitterness to it and some hints of orange. Pretty light.
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;"""not sure if this is technically a mead or a kolsch...Rabbit’s Foot is a meadery, but it smells and tastes like a Kolsch sweetened with honey, even though I know the honey was fermented. Basically, this was waaaay weaker (4.2%) than Chaucer’s Mead, but it totally works as a summer session beer. Usually when I go to breweries, their ""honey"" ale is a crappy blonde or golden with some honey thrown in, but this is actually a very well crafted kolsch underneath, and a near perfect amount of honey...I thought the honey was lacking at first, but not as it opened up. Pours just a touch darker than a standard kolsch. Fairly high carbonation, thin hrad and light-medium bodied. Aroma is more kolsch than honey, but nice. Flavor is very refreshing...some citrus, grain, and honey finish. Although not my favorite style, well done!"""
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;Sample at the Rabbit’s Foot Meadery. Clear golden color with a medium fluffy white head that diminishes gradually to an outer ring. Spotty lacing. Aroma of fruit, doughy malt and hops. The finish is fruity with a biscuit malt aftertaste. Slightly below average Kölsch overall.
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;Draught @ Rabbits Foot Meadery, Sunnyvale, CA Pours clear pale yellow with a white head. Aroma has notes of malt, honey and floral and fruity. Taste is light sweet and light bitter with a light floral and slightly dry finish. Body is light, texture is thin, carbonation is soft.
Red Branch Biere De Miele;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Flavored - Other;Red Branch Cider & Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. It’s a clear, golden beer topped by a white head. The aroma is lightly fruity, feeling dry, with a honey twist. Fruity, lightly honey-ish flavor with a decent bitterness. Medium to thin on the palate, dry, and with a short finish. Not a bad one, but rather boring and uninteresting. 130808
Belgoo Witte;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Flemish Brabant, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Belgoo;Big thanks to Phil L. Aroma is malts and citrus. Flavour quite malty too and a decent amount of citrus and wheat. When I say decent amount, I mean quite mellow which I like. Refreshing and tasty. Not bad.
Belgoo Witte;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Flemish Brabant, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Belgoo;Very refreshing, smooth wheatbeer. Citrus tones. Ideal thirst quetcher for the summer season. Unfortunately not yet for sale (we tested preproduction samples)
Belgoo Witte;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Flemish Brabant, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Belgoo;A little better white beer as Blanche des neiges. Tasted on same festival. There is also a Belgoo Blond. The blond I do not have tasted yet
Belgoo Witte;Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Flemish Brabant, Belgium;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brouwerij Belgoo;Don’t shoot the rater, but, seen the double oo is circled on the bottle, I think it refers to the international indication on airplanes, Belgium being OO Fast gone, dense white head, shards of lace over fully hazy pale lemon-yellow beer. Overpowering coriandernose, with false orange/citrus notes, and a bit of hazelnut oil(?). Fruity, false-lemony taste from the coriander overdose. God, what ails these people? Wheatslickness, light to medium bodied. Another cartoon-like repeat performance of a Hoegaarden. I am informed this beer is NOT a definitive version, just an experimental version. As this might mean extensive change, the beer will have to be retried and rerated.
Archers Nosmo King;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Stillage from the Marquee at Bromsgrove Rugby Club 14/07/2007 Fruity hop aroma. Clear golden coloured and hoppy with a slightly dry malt finish. A little thin.
Archers Nosmo King;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);I can only agree with the previous comment. This was brewed to mark the end of smoking in pubs, but does not stand out in any way from the norm. A golden beer with not much aroma and a slightly sweet taste. I could find no trace of smoke in this inoffensive beer.
Archers Nosmo King;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask conditioned at The George, Barford St Michael, Oxon. Pale gold with white head. Brewed to celebrate Englands change to No Smoking in Public places and like the day, this was a non entity. Lowly flavoured with the Archers ashy taste, yes almost like tobacco ash. Sweet on the edges, really not worth bothering with.
Hydes Golden Brown;Salford, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Hydes Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Nursery Inn, Heaton Norris 09/06/2007 Fruit and hop aromas. Golden amber coloured fruity and slightly sweet with some bitterness in a crisp malt finish.

A copper colour with a good sized off-white head. A nice floral aroma. A pretty standard bitter: some hoppiness, roasted malt, caramel and light bitterness. Some citrus in the finish. Somewhat boring.

Malty, roasted nose with notes of chocolate, dark bread and hints of citrus. Malty, roasted taste with dark bread, dried fruit, caramel, some chocolate and slightly tart hints of citrus. More than medium body, slightly bittersweet finish. The citric notes feel a bit out of place. Nice beer though.

Sandbacka Brown Ale;Sandviken, Sweden;Brown Ale;Sandbacka Bryggeri;Draught at Monk’s Porterhouse, Stockholm. Clear mahogany colour, small head. Lactic nose. Mid sweet with medium body and clean mouthfeel. Nice chocoltey roastiness. There’s tatr black verries, dark chocolate and notes of licorice. Salty bitterish finish. The somewhat lemony tartness actually works fairly well with the cocoa flavours, but nevertheless gives the beer a flawed impression. Typical Sandbacka beer - ambitious but imperfect.

Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Blackberry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at the Chicago location. Vibrant rose pink colour. Rather murky looking. Plenty of fruit in evidence. The fruit is quite sharp and tart - not too sweet and sickly. Fruit beers are not really my thing but this was quite pleasant.
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Blackberry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;On tap at RB - Chicago. Poured a deep, hazy pinkish-amber with a short off-white head. Aroma had a dry wheaty base with some sort of awfully-familiar blackberry liqueur.. the next hit from the fruit was rather fresh. Flavor found blackberry puree on top of a grainy, lighter toasted wheat core.. some vegetal undertones detract a bit, but this was still drinkable. Lighter-bodied on the palate with some points a touch too grainy.. watery at a couple other points.. nice and creamy middle. Quite solid for what it is.
Rock Bottom Chicago Walleye Blackberry Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a cloudy purple-yellow color. Head was white with good retention and lacing. Aroma was of subdued berries and a hint of grain. Tasted of honey touched grain and subdued berries with a pleasant fresh malty cereal grain aftertaste.

Zwarte Flesch;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;Bottle at Beer Brothers’ Festival 2007, Mechelen, Belgium Clear, yellow body. Somewhat off-white, creamy head. Cloyingly sweet aroma of salami (Joris says hot dog cooking water), spices, coriander. The aroma really doesn’t want to make you drink this. Somewhat bitter, quite alcoholic flavour, although it doesn’t contain that much alcohol. Not very well balanced either.
Zwarte Flesch;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;De Proefbrouwerij;"Pale gold with a very slight haze; very huge white head, leaving textbook lace. More fatty acids, hot dog cooking water, (diabel says salami), a bit fruity & grassy. Meaty esters in the taste, overripe grain that has gone wet. Ends a bit leafy. Definitely something sourish. I’d hesitate to call it infected, but it comes close. Medium bodied, a bit oily, buttery (molten) texture. In the aftertaste something spicy - a whiff of coriander? I’m underawed. Pity I haven’t tasted the former Van Den Bossche variety."
Rustic Rail Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;I thought this was a decent Miller style beer. I definately would not call this a mead in anyway, it had no sweetness, and lacked in honey flavor. but it had a nice bright golden body with a quickly dissipating head.
Rustic Rail Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;On tap at the Rustic Rail brewhouse, this beverage pours a clear, brownish-copper amber brew with a thin white head. Aroma of strong caramel and a faint flowery hop scent. Taste is lightly carbonated, bread doughy, and some caramel character. Medium bodied brew, this had a light bitterness and a touch of bread dough finish. Not as citrusy as most other pale ales but still quite drinkable.
Rustic Rail Oatmeal Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;Once the thick head settled, it settled into a chocolate coloured body, with a still pretty large vanilla coloured head. It had aromas of breakfast, cocoa and oatmeal. It wasn’t too sweet, and not too rich.
Rustic Rail Oatmeal Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;I had this brew about 8 months ago and forgot to rate it. This brewhouse is now closed but felt this beer was worth rating. Taste was sweet and creamy with a coffee aftertaste. One thing I remember was that the beer was pretty good and the food sucked, probably why they are no longer open.
Rustic Rail Oatmeal Stout;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;One of Rustic Rail’s better brews. On tap only at the Brewhouse, this beer pours an almost opaque dark brown brew with a thick light tan head. Aroma of nutty caramel, a touch of coffee, some lactose and a touch of dark chocolate. Taste is smooth, creamy, with a slight metalic aftertaste. Finish is smooth, light and slight bitter.
Grimbergen Cuvée Blanche;Obernai, France;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Kronenbourg (Carlsberg);Hazy, yellow color, not so big but creamy and hard, white head. Little citrusy, little spicy aroma with a huge amount of vanilla. Spicy and hoppy taste, light body, little watery, very refreshing.

Rustic Rail Nut Brown Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;On tap at the Rustic Rail Brewhouse, this beverage pours a clear dark reddish brown brew with a white head that dissolves quickly to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of flowery hops, some caramel and a touch of roasted nuts. Taste is slightly carbonated, medium bodied with a metalic/acidic aftertaste. Finish has some nutty roasted malt and a slight bitter finish.
Rustic Rail Golden Lager;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;On tap, only at the Rustic Rail Brewhouse, this beverage pours a golden pale blonde brew with a think, fast dissolving white head. Leaves behind a thin off-white ring and just barely any lacing. Aroma of sweet cereal grains and cooked vegetables and corn. Taste is lightly carbonated, softly crisp, smooth light bodied mouthfeel. The hop have just a very light spiciness and a sweet malty finish.
Rustic Rail Honey Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;When this was poured as a sample for me, the head was big and it went down very sweet. I thought maybe it was just me and I ordered it anyway. But when it came back in a glass my first sips were again sweet and overly malted. There wasn’t a faintest bit of hops in the beer. and i was really dissapointed.

Finish has some floweryh hops but slightly sweet.
Rustic Rail Amber Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;This was my favorite out of all the ales I tried here.

Rustic Rail Amber Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rustic Rail Grill & Brewhouse;On tap at the Rustic Rail Brewhouse. Pours a clear reddish copper brew with a creamy off-white head. Aroma of grassy hops, multi-grain malt, and some orange peel zest.

Leffe Tablée Ambrée;Leuven, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);Bottle at Beer Brothers’ Festival 2007, Mechelen, Belgium Deep brown body. Very sweet aroma of malts. Lightly bitter, moderately sweet flavour. Quite disgusting.
Leffe Tablée Ambrée;Leuven, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Anheuser-Busch InBev Belgium (AB InBev);"No head but a yellowish rim; red-brown beer. Nutty, horse fodder smell, almonds and molasses. Sweet, sugared parsley, molasses - CHEAP in taste and probably in ingredients. False fruity, faintly beefy esters. Medium to better bodied, slick. Nutty aftertaste. They are really searching for cheap producing methods, aren’t they? This is a bl**dy disgrace for a brewery with such financial possibilities. Oh yes, dividends are the only Brazilian passion. And why a Leffe Rossa, and now a Tablée Ambrée (name???)..."
Titletown Beergarden Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Titletown Brewing Company;Another winner from Titletown: Pours a clear orange colour with a small white head. Aroma is very pleasent, strong floral hops and pine- well balanced citrus hops all the way through. but half way through the palate is smoothes itself out and becomes even more delightful, eventually softening up in the finish.
Titletown Beergarden Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Titletown Brewing Company;Ontap at the brewery. Not impressed at all with any of the beers at this brewery. Typical poor to barely average macro brewpub offerings. The food was much better however, but I’ll save that for rating the place itself. Poor non-existent head and watery appearance. Hardly any decernable aroma having to really REALLY grasp at pulling anything out. Flavour itself is actaully a bit more than I reckoned for with some light pilsner malt and citrus. However, the hop profile was sad and lonely here with a light dusting of floral and grassiness. The house character is very prevalent as well with all their beers having an odd metallic taste and certain terroir that I find very quite displeasing. Not a fan at all.
Titletown Beergarden Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Titletown Brewing Company;On tap at Titletown. Poured clear medium amber with a short white head and a light ring. Aroma picked up sweet caramel and medium-skinned fruits.. very soft with a light floral backing.. quite nice. Flavor was of lightly-toasted caramel at the core… quite sweet with mild floral bitterness around.. perhaps some artificial sweetener evident at the back-end.. tacky, long-ish finish. Medium-bodied and sweet throughout with a sticky-sweet finish. OK balance.
Titletown Beergarden Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Titletown Brewing Company;Another from Skyview. Cloudy, copper color. Thick white head. this is a good looking beer. Aroma has light hops. Flavor is light hops as well with malt, and a very salty taste. Some grassy flavor, and interesting in that is is more focused on malt than hops.
Titletown Beergarden Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Titletown Brewing Company;"Once again thanks to skyview for sharing. Light grain/malt nose on this hazy brown beer - a little dark for a ""pale"" ale. Roasted malt body with an earthy flavor that ben said was from some fuggle hops or something. Not what I’d expect from a Pale ale but very good."
Titletown Beergarden Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Titletown Brewing Company;Growler thanks to (guess who) Skyview. Copper color with a medium head. Slight hop aroma, more Noble and earthy than American. Dry wheat flavor with very earthy hop flavors. I know it’s Willamette, but it tastes like East Kent Goldings. Seems like more of an English Pale Ale than American.
Titletown Beergarden Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Titletown Brewing Company;From a growler. Pours a coppery color with thin white head that quickly dissolves. Aroma is light caramel, bready and hops aromas. Taste is light caramel, sweet bread, and light floral hops. Moderate carbonation. This almost like a Sam Adams Boston lager clone. Good stuff.
Titletown Beergarden Pale Ale;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Titletown Brewing Company;On tap, only at the Titletown brewpub. Pours a clear golden amber brew with an average off-white head. Dissolves to a fine film with a bubbly white ring. Aroma is very light with bread-like character and grassy hops. Taste is slightly carbonated, sweet at first and then a mild hop bitterness in the finish. Slight bready aftertaste with a lingering hop bitterness.
Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Draft @ Founders. Pours a clear brown color with a minimal off white head. The aroma is caramel malt, fruits, bread, and light floral hops. The flavor is more caramel malts, chocolate, light fruit, and the slightest hint of nuts. Light bitterness to the finish. Medium bodied. Not a bad brown ale.
Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);2007 Great Taste: Whooo! Mmm... Rick Flair tie in... Anyway, this was a decent brown. Taste of bread, toffee, and peanuts. Slight bitter end with a tiny twang of alcohol that rests on your tongue. Good body.
Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);MBGF07. Dark brown body with a medium beige head, lasting. The aroma is cola, caramel, toffee and grapes. Flavor is caramel, light berry, nuts and grapes. Medium body is very soft with dense carbonation.

Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Tap @ GTMW. Hazed and caramel chocolate in color with a khaki tan head. Maris otter and hazelnuts meet brown sugar and woody shavings in the nose to do little to increase the allure of the ale. Light bodied and flavored, mildly sweetened with brown bread. Diluted caramel ribbons attempt to give traits to the blasé beer. Harshly carbonated and medium bodied at best, finish with a nutty edge amidst chocolate and pecan shavings to boot.
Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Draft at Indiana Microbrewers festival. Pours a murky brown with a huge tan head. The aroma was of nuts, a bit of chocolate, and plenty of malts. The flavor is a combination of a brown ale and a Belgian Dubbel. The roasted nuttiness of a brown, with some of the complex flavors of a dubbel. Nice clean finish, with just a touch of hops. Well done. I wish they would bottle this just so I could get the Ric Flair label.
Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);Draft sample at MBGF07. Poured a hazy dark brown color with a moderate frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Medium toasted nutty malty aroma. Medium body with a thin texture. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. I would not recommend this to a freind as the first choice.
Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap: The aroma is lightly nutty with some faint roast and smoke. It’s a barely transparent brown with a small off-white head. The flavor starts with some faint, somewhat watery chocolate and fruity sweetness. I get a faint sourness in the background. Flavor finishes with a faint roasty grassiness.
Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. Dark warm brown with a slight haze and a fine tan head. Not much of a head after a while. Faintly dark malty. Not too chocolatey, a bit nutty. Some out of place roast. Clean, other than a little fruit, but largely empty. Full creamy body, small bubbled mouthfeel without being watery, this is still quenching. Sweet malty brew. Creamy with a bit of fruit. A hint of diacetyl seems to only add to the creaminess in this beer. Rather clean with a dry finish. Some floral hops on the back end. I
Founders Space Mountain Brown;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Founders Brewing Company (Mahou San Miguel);On tap at Founders. Cloudy orange-brown body, medium buff head. I’m not sure what they were going for here, but there was a surprising estery component, with notes of banana and clove permeating the otherwise rather simple sweet, toasty body. Thin, lacking depth and character. Reminded me of a dunkelweizen rather than a brown ale.
Funfair Magic Mouse;Elston, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Funfair;Cask Stillage from the Outside Bar at the Black Horse, Darwen 26/05/2007 Fruity aroma. Dark red slightly rich and smooth with some bitterness and dryness in a lasting roast finish.

A light brown head soon diminishing, clear blackish with red hints. Moderately sweet and slightly bitter flavour, a slightly salty finish. A dry, slightly astringent finish. A pleasant enough mild, but with a definate salty finish, unusual.
Tomos Watkin Magic Lagyr (Bottle);Swansea, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tomos Watkin;"Clear golden with a big white head which diminishes quickly leaving medium lacing in the glass. Aroma is grass, slightly floral, a hint of white pepper. Taste is slightly floral and grassy with a hint of white pepper in the aftertaste. Medium sleek body with medium carbonation. I am not a great fan of lagers full stop, but this one is the one I would choose over other lagers available. Nothing too extraordinary (it’s a lager, after all) but definitely stands out of the ""lager crowd"". Lager lovers - you will love it!"

Tomos Watkin Magic Lagyr (Bottle);Swansea, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tomos Watkin;50cl bottle from Spar in Rhos on Sea. Pours golden with a decent head and steady carbonation. The nose has lemon, cream and some green vegetable thing going on. The taste has more of the same though it slightly lacks the fresh green vegetable zing. The palate has a big body for lager, very creamy in texture and it just lacks some bitterness in the finish. Overall, I think it’s a decent lager, just needs some more bitterness, in my opinion.
Tomos Watkin Magic Lagyr (Bottle);Swansea, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tomos Watkin;Clean, clear and cheerful lager. A bright golden colour with a big opening fizz producing a short lived small head. Aroma and flavour of barley. Quite dry. Very refreshing. Will be getting again.

Tomos Watkin Magic Lagyr (Bottle);Swansea, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tomos Watkin;2010: Today is 24th April, yesterday was ’Saint Georges Day’, the patron Saint of England. Yesterday I asked my wife to pour me an English Ale to celebrate my Saints Day, she produced this, a Welsh Lager (sometimes I dispair!). Anyway the brown 500ml bottle had been poured into my Batemans pint sleeve, so I had no choice but to consume and review it. The label claimed it is brewed using the best German hops, finest English Malts (hurray for Saint George), Danish yeast and crystal Welsh water. It looked every inch a fine lager based beer, bright golden in colour with a firm pure white head sat majestically on top. Sadly the smell let it down, there wasn’t any, so it gets my standard score of 3 for a lager no show aroma. I was however impressed with everything else, the lager was dry, refreshing and could certainly hold its own against most lager/pilsner style beers I’ve had and reviewed. Pity it was Welsh, or should I say, pity I reviewed it on the wrong day?
Tomos Watkin Magic Lagyr (Bottle);Swansea, Wales;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Tomos Watkin;Bottle. golden with a small head.Clear appearance and slightly sweet.Well balanced, well bottled and pleasant.

Rail House Silver Cream Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Sampler Brewery 7/31/14 (Rail House Restaurant)-Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma of nothing. Taste of green apple and slight hops. This light bodied brew was pretty bland.
Rail House Silver Cream Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Decent beer in the refreshing summer thirst quenching way. Pours a hazy yellow. Not much of an aroma, mostly bread and yeast. The taste was a bit bland. Just a good old fashioned summer beer.
Rail House Silver Cream Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy light straw body, thin off-white head. Crisp, grassy nose with hints of green apple. Sweet, tangy body, with a somewhat harsh interplay of green apple skin and cereal and grassy notes. Very light and not particularly pleasant.

Rail House Silver Cream Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Thanks to Bob for the bottle! Slight gusher.. poured clear, pale golden with a creamy, seemingly synthetic cap of white head. The aroma picked up interesting floral and lemony character paired with some green apple.. definitely deviating from any intended style, but it reminded me of something I really liked. The flavor had green appley tartness throughout that didn’t detract from the enjoyment as much as you’d think.. bready and grainy notes at the core.. light floral, earthy, and lemony bitterness around. Creamy, heavy carbonation on the palate that became somewhat cloying on the back.. all in all, decent balance and quite drinkable.
Rail House Silver Cream Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Dark straw color with a lid of white bubbles. Hints of malt, grain and bit of cidre in the aroma. Perhaps a bit of floral hops mix with the mild apples. Mild sweet pale malt in the start. A touch of corn and mild sweet herbal hops in the middle. Fairly dry in the finish and linger. Just a touch of cereal. This would be a good one for a lazy Saturday afternoon in the summer.
Rail House Silver Cream Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Cool! Another one of Menominee-Marinette/Oconto brewery brands of the past revived by Rail House. This beer pours a clear pale golden blonde brew with a thick and creamy white head. Slow dissolving and nice lacing. Aroma of light roasted malt, flowery hops and a touch of sweet cream. Taste is light bodied, slightly carbonated, some bread dough with a sweet hop aftertaste. A very faint hop bitterness to give this brew a refreshing taste.
Rail House Brewers Best Pilsener;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Draft. golden pale pour' light haze. Light fruity pils aroma. This is the first one from this brewery I'm disappointed in. Very eatern euro pale lager like. Yeasty.

Rail House Brewers Best Pilsener;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Average at best but then I am not a pilsner guy. Pours light yellow with the typical pilsner aroma and flavor. Give me an amber or Irish red anytime.
Rail House Brewers Best Pilsener;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. The arom is pale yellow with a white head. The aroma was bready with some biscutis and bell pepper. The taste has some spicy beller peppers with some meaty bologna. It’s ok.
Rail House Brewers Best Pilsener;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Light golden color with a smaller, but stable popcorn colored head. Light malt and toasted grain scents. Only a hint of herbal hops. Needs a touch more hops for this style to differentiate between this and a regular pale lager. Decent lace. Some grains, light honey, bit of grass and dough in the flavors. Some mild perfume flavors wonder in as well. Reminds me of a pre- pro lager more than anything else.
Rail House Brewers Best Pilsener;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Thanks to Bob for bringing the bottle! This bottle was a foamer!.. clear brighter golden with a creamy white head. The aroma found soft dusty lemon and detergenty notes.. somehow pleasant with a bit of dusty bread emerging with warmth. The flavor found sweet bready notes and odd fruit-like (but not really fruity) notes.. sweet overall with nothing very good going for it.. grainy, fruity sweetness at the back. Lighter-bodied with carbonation on the high side.. not a very memorable feel on the palate.
Rail House Brewers Best Pilsener;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Clearish straw body, spritzy carbonation, medium tight off-white head. Grassy, floral hops nose. Nice, easy-going palate pairing honey and nectary malts with floral, grassy hops. Light, sweet, and well-balanced. Above-average.
Rail House Brewers Best Pilsener;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Another one of Menominee-Marinette brewery brands of the past revived by Rail House. On tap and in bottles at the brewpub, this beer pours a light golden amber brew with a thick white head that leaves an excellent lacing. Aroma is lighter than Silver Cream but still has light roasted malt, flowery hops and a touch of vanilla. Taste is lightly carbonated with a sweet doughy taste. Finish is semi-sweet and creamy with a good bitter balance. Though this is not the original recipe of the historical Brewers’ Best, it is still very refreshing! For you beer historians, this brand is the legendary Brewers’ Best Pilsener beer that was at various times brewed by 13 different breweries between 1943 and 1967. Walter Brewing Company of Trinidad, Colorado started this beer in 1943 and shared a unique yeast strain that gave this a smooth, light bready and crisp flavor. Though the yeast strain has been long gone since 1950, (Two Rivers Beverage Co. in Two Rivers, Wisconsin had the last yeast batch), kudos to Rail House for reviving this historical brand of the very distant past.

Rail House Big Mac IPA;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Sample 7/31/14 (Railhouse)-Pours golden with a small head. Aroma of hops and malt. Taste of the same. This light to medium bodied brew was well balanced and not too shabby.
Rail House Big Mac IPA;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Poured a rather cloudy golden-copper,with minimal head. Aroma of hops, malt, some breadiness and citrus notes. Flavor was very fresh and quite bitter, dominated by pine-hop bite, with citrus and some malt sweetness to round things out. I quite liked it.
Rail House Big Mac IPA;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;I had this right after the Kolsch which may skew my ratings higher than normal. This had a good hoppy aroma and a nice hoppy bite. Not a big hop profile to speak of. Decent beer.
Rail House Big Mac IPA;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy straw-orange body, medium puffy, pillowy off-white head. Spicy, soapy, citrusy hops nose. Rather thin and dry body, with oily hops resins, dominated by pine and citrus rind. Dry, biscuity malts and fruity esters complement the hops.
Rail House Big Mac IPA;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Bottled. An unclear golden beer with a huge orangey head. The aroma is sweet with notes of malt and citrus. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of straw, citrus, and grapefruit, but the body is thin. Thanks Papsoe for sharing.
Rail House Big Mac IPA;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;3 oz. sample at brewery. Golden pour, persistent white head. Big citrus aroma, flavor bitterness upfront but soft on the finish. Light-med body, medium-full palate. Very nicely done IPA.
Rail House Big Mac IPA;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;IPA;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Thanks to Bob for the bottle! Poured clear light-medium orange with a creamy eggshell head. The aroma picked up oranges and floral over a subtle caramel base.. soft and well-balanced. The flavor had caramel and pale malt at the core with orange, pine, and floral bitterness around.. the hoppage lost a little character at the finish, but it was still solid. Medium-bodied, well-balanced, and refreshing.. definitely a pleasant surprise!

Rail House Zummer Fest;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Sample 7/31/14 (RailHouse)-Pours a light golden with a small white head. Aroma of wheat and citrus. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew missed the mark.
Rail House Zummer Fest;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Exactly what it is meant to be. A German style wheat beer, light and refreshing. Pours a light gold with a citrus orange aroma probably due to the orange slice on the glass but isn’t that what it should be? Light refreshing taste, lots of orange and a bit of pepper, nicely balanced. Come on you beer snobs, this is what it should be.
Rail House Zummer Fest;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brew pub. Very light yellow, almost like a wit / Blue Moon. This was a bit of a clunker, sorry. Some lemon up-front, and lemon at the end, but not much else that you’d typically taste in a wheat beer (bubble gum, banana, clove, etc.) Body and flavor more like a Kolsch.
Rail House Zummer Fest;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, this beer pours a semi-hazy golden pale blonde brew with an average off-white head. Spotty lacing after the dissolve. Aroma is light wheat with some coriander spice, and yeast. Taste is smooth, creamy and sweet with character of banana esters and some noble hop bitterness.

Rail House Dumb Blonde;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Sample 7/31/14 (RailHouse)-Pours a medium golden with a small white head. Aroma of grains and sweetness. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew reminded of a Kolsch as I am not a big fan of that style.
Rail House Dumb Blonde;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Don’t ask me to rate a Kolsch. I am not a big fan. For a Kolsch, this is good.
Rail House Dumb Blonde;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. The body was hazy pale yellow Fresh grains and some woody notes are the main smells. Light almonds shells and apple core wre fairly strong flavors. This had a longering bitter finish
Rail House Dumb Blonde;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Straw color with a somewhat wispy white head. Much like a blonde can’t find much in this one. Hints of pale malt and touch of floral hops. The fact that there are no real off scents is the biggest plus. Light malt and grain flavors. Quite clean, but also quite light. A shame more people at the bar were not drinking this instead of the amount of bud light that I saw served.
Rail House Dumb Blonde;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewpub, the beer pours a clear pale golden blonde brew with a thin off-white head. Aroma is very faint, just a touch of regular barley malt, and little hop presence. Taste is soft, sweet and creamy. Finish is light and sweet with no bitter aftertaste. A pretty much clean and crisp light beer.
Rail House Red Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Draft brewery 8/13/04-Pours a medium amber with a small head. Aroma of caramel and malt. Taste of the same with some toffee on the back end. This medium bodied brew is not bad.
Rail House Red Ale;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Interesting beer name. Just like New York City, this brewery likes its brand name so much it called its name twice. :-p This beer is available on tap at the brewpub and pours a clear penny reddish copper amber brew with a creamy beige head. Slowly dissolves to a fine lacing and foamy ring. Aroma is unique with characteristics of caramel, milk chocolate and a touch of toffee. Taste is smooth, creamy and distinct caramel barley malt to the tongue. Finish is sweet and smooth, slight flowery hop taste with no bitter aftertaste.
Rail House Bock Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;I was not a big fan of this one. Pours a dark amber with a small tan head. The aroma had a lot of bread. The flavor had more bread. Give me an IPA.
Rail House Bock Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Thanks to Bob for the bottle! Poured medium coppery-amber with a fine, creamy cap of beige head. The aroma picked up toasted darker caramel and anise notes accented by spicy floral and earthy hoppage.. warmth brought out interesting alternative grainy character. The flavor had caramel, almonds, and nutty character at the core with dry, spicy floral and earthy bitterness again at the edges.. sweet candi sugar and yeasty notes were laced throughout.. slight buttery notes and light oxidation came through on the finish. Light-medium bodied with higher carbonation and a decent feel on the palate.. warmer than it probably should’ve been on the finish, but still aiight.
Rail House Bock Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Bright umber color with a hint of ruby. Moderate, somewhat diminishing dark canvas colored head. Aromas of dark caramel, wood fiber, dark currants, sorghum and touch of buckwheat. Interesting, but not quite engaging scents. Quite sweet with lots of caramelized sugar and dark Belgian candi and some light spice. Seems too sweet, but does not come off as worty or under-attenuated. Finish and linger have a mild nuttiness. I can see this being an early example of this style. I enjoy it for that.
Rail House Bock Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Light orange/amber body, off-white to buff head. Toasty, somewhat burnt caramel roast aroma, light at cold serving temperature. Unique body, with a dirty, dusty, woody fruitiness reminiscent of a Flemish Brown Ale, in addition to the more traditional burnt caramels and toast. Very strange beer. Alcohol punch is surprisingly strong for 5.6% ABV. A tad harsh, but worth a try.
Rail House Bock Beer;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;This bock beer is available even during the summer on tap or in bottles at the brewpub. Unlike most dark bock beers, this beverage pours a semi-hazy caramel amber brew with a fast dissolving off white head. Aroma is light sweet caramel, toasted malt and a touch of vegetable hops. Taste is smooth, creamy, with taste character of caramel and toasted malt. Finish is a good balance of sweet and bitter tastes which then changes to sllight bitter after the finish. The beer bottle label is an interesting story. The label design is a replica of Menominee-Marinette’s stock bock beer label that was used between 1938 and 1941.
Rail House Old Craft Brew;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Thanks to Bob for the hook-up! Poured medium amber with a creamy, well-retained cap of off-white head.. some chunky sediment in there, but the color was solid. The aroma picked up softer bready and caramel notes with a faint hit of green apple and some herbal tea surrounding.. solid presentation. The flavor had more caramel at the core paired with a bit of maple and dark fruit.. dried leafy and earthy bitterness around.. finished crisp and refreshing for the most part, but it did have some tacky components. Lighter-bodied with full carbonation on the palate.. balance was good and it was easy drinkin’.
Rail House Old Craft Brew;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;"Lightly hazed amber/copper color with a moderate tight bubbled cream colored head. Heavy caramel aromas with hints of dried leaves, light currants, raw sugar and maple sap. SOmewhat rustic in scent. A balance of dry caramel, herbal tea in the flavors. Toffee and hints of ripe fruit also present. Finish and linger are quite bitter and lasting. Has a real traditional ""feel"" to it. It’s good to see this brewery back on track. My last visit a few years ago was most depressing."
Rail House Old Craft Brew;Marinette, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rail House Restaurant and Brewery;Picked up a single 12-oz bottle from the brewpub in Marinette, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-hazy caramel amber brew with a thin off-white head that dissolves to a thin ring and island film. Lacing is spotty that quickly disappears. Aroma of caramel malt, sweet apples and pears, with a touch of brown sugar. Taste is lightly sweet, carbonated with flavors of caramel and toffee. Finish is slightly bitter with a lingering dry aftertaste. Not the original recipe that Menomonee/Marinette Brewing Co. (1933-1960) and Oconto Brewing Company (1961-1965) produced, but I’m happy to see Rail House resurrect another historical beer brand for the next generation of beer drinkers.

Rivertowne Belgian Invasion;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;Stronger ale aroma, with sweet olfactory impact. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color but ever so slightly hazy. The first taste is earthy, wet hay and medium low carbonation. Slight sour hints are prevelant. I could be mistaken but I think it makes me think a little bit of the flavor or Corsy. Not overpowering. Not quite as refined as a wheat beer should be. Comes across more like a german hefe. Hides the alcohol well. Overall a decent wheat beer with a unique flavor. However, does not stand up to the likes of Hoegaarden.
Rivertowne Belgian Invasion;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;Sampled on draft a the brewery this beer poured a cloudy pale golden color with a small white head. The aroma was spicy, fruity and sweet. The flavor was very spicy, lemony and wheaty. The coriander spiciness really lingers on the palate. This is probably the spiciest Belgian Wit I have ever encountered - in a good way. The beer was rather robust and flavorful.
Rivertowne Ultra Light Tackle;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rivertowne Brewing;Sample at the brewpub. This beer is a clear yellow-gold color with a thin and fizzy white head that burns away quickly. Spotty lacing. Aroma of malt and corn. Light body with flavors of sweet malt, mild hops and more corn. The finish is short and sweet. Forgettable entry beer overall.
Rivertowne Ultra Light Tackle;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rivertowne Brewing;Draught sample at the Pour House. Has a very nice aroma for a session lager. Mild sweet grain with floral, subtle hoppy character. No cooked corn or cardboard, which plagues so many of the style. Fresh. Clear golden pale body with very little white head. Thin watery body, which one expects, with mild carbonation. For a lighter pale lager, has a nice strong pilsner malt taste to it, with beany hops bitterness and some light sweetness. Clean crisp finish with the smallest amount of cooked veg, ending in a smooth after. If I drank a lot of this style, I would opt for a growler of this.
Rivertowne Ultra Light Tackle;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Rivertowne Brewing;On tap at the Pour House. Barely yellow, white head. Aroma is malt, hay. Flavor is corn, malt.

Rivertowne Out of Plumb Pale Ale (Not A Fruit Beer);Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rivertowne Brewing;Perfumy aroma, very attractive to the olfactory. Orange brown in color with no head. Darker than most APA. Perfumy aroma caries over into the flavors. Medium hop flavors, but not like an IPA. Easier to appreciate and less offensive than many pale ales. Tho not the impact of an IPA the hop bitterness is ever present. Bitter grapefruit rind finsih that hangs for a while. Not quite as good or enjoyable as Acme California Pale Ale or Stoudts American Pale Ale. Better than Tröegs Pale Ale. The aroma of this is better than most APA.

Gouden Predikheer Tripel;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Commissioned for the Lichtfeesten of Reet, a stereotypical tripel with sticky, loose, creamy, lightly beige head and peach blond colour, cloudy. Sweet fruity, yeasty and florally hoppy aroma, melon, honey, gin, orange peel, coriander, something sulphuric (fried egg). Soft sweetish fruitiness in the mouth, not sugary or sticky, mild carbo, light caramelly and honeyish malts, coriander touch, but unfortunately solvents too which become stronger in the finish to the point where they reach a plastic-like ’chemicality’ which more or less ruins it for me, especially since the wryness is further enhanced by badly hidden alcohol. Not a very good tripel.

Gouden Predikheer Tripel;Lochristi - Hijfte, Belgium;Tripel;De Proefbrouwerij;Säuerlicher, etwas alkoholischer Antrunk. Hier noch mittelintensiv, was mit der Zeit aber deutlich nachlässt. Etwas hellmalzig, der Alkohol wirkt in einem scharfen Hintergrundton. Nun wird das Bier in geringem Maße herb, zusammen mit der alkoholischen Würze ist das Bier hier unerwartet harmonisch und weist Gewürznoten von Birne und später Bitterschokolade auf. Das Bier wandelt sich so mit der Zeit zu einem schmackhaften Gebräu, das aber doch einen Tick aromatischer sei könnte. 11/10/9/9/6/9

Bubes Eis-stout;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Bubes Brewery;The story goes...The fermenter froze up with the Irish Stout sitting in there and the brewer scraped the ice out of the frozen batch. Voi-la! An eis stout... Appears a deep majogany with a dark crimson outer edge. A small head quickly fades into a mild cap. No lacing is left behind in this one.. Smell is of coffee, cream, mocha, cocoa, and nuts. Taste is of the aromas with bitter mocha grounds mixed with ripened fruit. Mouthfeel is full bodied but slightly thin on the start and finish of this brew.
Bubes Eis-stout;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Bubes Brewery;Sample courtesy of Axilla (thanks!).

Trout River Vindicator Weizenbock;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Trout River Brewing Company;"My Bottom Line: This lightly watery and clean Bock offered lean toasted and caramel malts atop mild alcohol warmth and whispering spiciness. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam surfs the amber gown. -The Vindicator I had was billed as a Doppelbock, yet their Doppelbock is not supposed to be called Vindicator. In any case, as most Trout River beers I’ve had, the style doesn’t seem to important; they just brew what they feel like brewing, completely ignoring stylistic guidelines. -The flavor profile was very simple and not compelling at all. -The body was quite slim, especially for such a strong lager. On tap at the Vermont Brewers’ Fest."

Trout River Vindicator Weizenbock;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Trout River Brewing Company;6 ounce draught sample at the Vermont Brewer’s Fest (July 2007). Just a bit of creamy foam lasts as a ring atop the hazy caramel-copper body....mild aroma: a bit of tobacco, faint sour/tart wheat, a touch of berry, sweet caramel....very sweet at the front, but becomes quickly tart and dry, and at the finish sour -- too sour....syrupy, thick caramel texture doesn’t help when mixed with this strong sourness....alas, this and the other 2 I sampled from TR all seemed poorly kept or infected, I can’t tell which, but all were a little sour/off. This one fared the best and was certainly drinkable, but I think I’ll have to finally make it out to the pub one of these weekends to really get a picture of what Shaun Hill’s cooking up there....
Trout River Vindicator Weizenbock;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Trout River Brewing Company;"Thanks to grassrootsVT for this... Appears a transparent amber with a small, off-white head that quickly fizzles out into a mild cap. Scattered spots of lacing are left around the glass. Smell is fruity, full of caramel, toffee, roasted nuts, and citrus. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a sweet, fruity flavor from the lagering yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth, mildly sweet up front and sort of yummy despite not fitting the style completely. I know many brewers have been using a lager yeast lately for a ""Doppel Weizen Bock"", which isn’t a true style(yes - I know that’s what it says on the Aventinus bottle) but more of a hybrid of using a wheat base and lagering the brew like a doppelbock, rather than using the Bavarian Ale strain with it’s naturally spicy phenols that made Aventinus famous."
Trout River Vindicator Weizenbock;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Trout River Brewing Company;Sample courtesy of weeare138 (thanks!).

Trout River Vindicator Weizenbock;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Trout River Brewing Company;Poured a lightly hazy, reddish amber color with a thin off white head, that left no lacing on the glass.

Appalachian Coconut Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Served on-tap at the ABC brewpub in Harrisburg into a standard pint. A - Pours deep brown, borderline black, with a small half finger tall tan head leaving spotty lacing down the entire glass. S - Plenty of dark roast and sweet coconut dominate the nose of this one. Some light vanilla, sweet chocolate, and a touch of char round out the aroma. It is really way too sweet for its own good. T - Lots of dark roasted malt and sweet coconut run the show for this one. Bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and some light coffee add some additional flavors. Finish is far too sweet with plenty of it lingering for some time. Decent stuff but I have had much better. M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sticky sweet feel with plenty of coconut sweetness and some dark roasted malt in the finish. O - Decent stuff. It was ok but the large amount of sweetness really brought this one down a few notches. Good coconut flavor but it got a bit lost in all that darkness.

Appalachian Coconut Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);"Pours dark brown with cream-colored head. Aroma is of refreshing fruitiness (pear and coconut); it was surprising how much mixed-fruit-juice flavor the coconut clearly contributed to the aroma and to some extent the flavor. Tastes of refreshing fruit and strong coconut, a dry roastiness that is somewhat masked by the coconut, and minimal hops (less than the Pennypacker Porter). Overall, quite unique, but not something I’d look to drink often."

Appalachian Coconut Porter;Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;Appalachian Brewing Company (PA);Draft at the Harrisburg brewery. Dark brown body with a tan head, patchy but not thick.

Decent raspberry note and some hints of vanilla. A lot of bread, some light lemon, and a decent it of berry.

Downtown Joes Raspberry Blond;Napa, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Good aroma but falls flat on taste. Weird bitter hit in the middle. Okay finish. Needs more carbonation and consistency.
Downtown Joes Raspberry Blond;Napa, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Ugh. This one pours a clear golden color with a white head.

Downtown Joes Raspberry Blond;Napa, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Haven't had too many decent raspberry beers, this one is slightly above average. Pours a nice brown color, with white head. Smells intensely of raspberry, almost a little too candy-like. Taste is the same. Not quite as sweet as some others.

Downtown Joes Raspberry Blond;Napa, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;On tap 3(?) oz. sampler at Downtown Joe's Restaurant & Brewery. Clear, rusty amber with white head and fair lacing. Fruity berry aroma. Definitely smells of raspberries, but not totally so. Light, sweet artificial raspberry taste with a hint of grapefruit. Light body and carbonation. This beer brings to mind raspberry flavored seltzer water, but without the strong carbonation. A few lambics aside, fruit beers are not usually my thing. Maybe I'm being harsh, but this one is more fruit than beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Downtown Joes Raspberry Blond;Napa, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Tap at the brewpub in Napa. Mostly clear light orange pour wih a nice white head.

Downtown Joes Raspberry Blond;Napa, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Had on draft at the brewery in Napa in June. Pours a pale yellow with lots of bubbly. Taste is very very light on the palate, not much flavor, some backround raspberry flavor but not dominating or offensive. I actually found this one to be kinda refreshing given the head and my meal (fajita salad...really really good). Usually I don’t like raspberry beers much but this one I found enjoyable since they let the raspberry add to the beer without taking it over. That said, it is kinda watery, but you need that a little sometimes.
Downtown Joes Double Secret Probation IPA;Napa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Smelled like Pinesol and some hops. Nice deep orange color. Taste wasn’t as piney, but very hoppy. Some citrus. Mouth feel was standard. Tap at brewery.

Downtown Joes Double Secret Probation IPA;Napa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;On tap @ Downtown Joes. Chill hazed golden beer with some white foam. Pretty mild for a double IPA. Sweet caramel, some orange, peach, and a touch of pineapple. Kind of sweet and...smooth? Sort of a grassy flavor to it and a hint of celery. Bitter pine and grass, but a fair amount of sweet citrus and caramel malts.
Downtown Joes Double Secret Probation IPA;Napa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Pours translucent amber with a creamy beige head. Lots of citrus in the aroma. Flavor is mixed citrus resin over decent mildly roasty caramel. Finishes not exactly dry,, but pretty hoppy and bitter. Nice drink.
Downtown Joes Double Secret Probation IPA;Napa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;slightly sweeter and less bitter than most IPAs. Smooth and easy drinking, good but not quite as assertive as hoped.
Downtown Joes Double Secret Probation IPA;Napa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Draft at the brewery, firm bitterness, big American hops character, citrusy, grapefruit, bready maltiness in the finish
Downtown Joes Double Secret Probation IPA;Napa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Pours a hazy orange gold color with a quirky dissipating off-white head. Lacing coats the glass. The bouquet is phenomenal. Dried sweet fruit, grapefruit, and mown grass. The flavor is a little less bold than the bouquet, but much the same as what is picked up in the olfactory. In fact, the flavor was a little disappointing after having first gotten a whiff of the wonderful bouquet. Mouthfeel is decent, but a little flattened. All in all, a very good DIPA, but I’ve had so many ridiculously good DIPAs recently that it doesn’t rank well.
Downtown Joes Double Secret Probation IPA;Napa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;Very drinkable, albeit pretty strong in alcohol. I had this at the pub in Napa. My senses might have been dulled by the Tantric IPA that preceded it.

Downtown Joes Double Secret Probation IPA;Napa, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Downtown Joes Restaurant & Brewery;This is a very good double ipa very hoppy but not to bitter. I like bitter ipa but the floral flavors are what bring me back to ipa over and over. Had on draft a Joes started out with a small white head and a full amber to orange color. The aroma was just ok a touch muted. What it was missing in aroma it made up in flavor full body,rich and very floral. Over great beer.

A change of glass and this was great improvement on my previous beer &#40see previous rating at FFTMC&#41 Nice aroma of hops, malt and bags of fruitiness, its a lovely really quite traditional bitter aroma.

Vailima Special Export Lager;Apia, Samoa;Pilsener - Imperial;Samoa Breweries (Paradise Beverages Fiji - Coca-Cola Amatil);Bottle from Pack and Save in Napier on 15 November 2018. This is my first ever beer from Samoa and much to my delight it was reasonably good. I was expecting a pale and pasty looking beer with little flavour but instead what I got when I poured the beer from the bottle was a vibrant looking amber coloured beer with a big fluffy white head. Medium bodied in the mouth with a strong hit of alcohol in the finish.
Vailima Special Export Lager;Apia, Samoa;Pilsener - Imperial;Samoa Breweries (Paradise Beverages Fiji - Coca-Cola Amatil);750ml bottle BB 15/12/2016 Fruity estery aroma. Poured pale straw with small head. After the (minimal) bitterness all I got was wet cardboard. Perfectly fine on a hot day in downtown Apia but a fresher sample would have been better.
Vailima Special Export Lager;Apia, Samoa;Pilsener - Imperial;Samoa Breweries (Paradise Beverages Fiji - Coca-Cola Amatil);Christ Almighty! This packs quite a punch. Typical lager flavours, slightly honeyed malt, apple, a bit of grassy hop bite, alcohol is very well hidden, just a very slight numbing on the tongue. It’s actually very similar, yet a bit better than most other green bottle slosh.

Vailima Special Export Lager;Apia, Samoa;Pilsener - Imperial;Samoa Breweries (Paradise Beverages Fiji - Coca-Cola Amatil);"Unlike any other lager I’ve had, this has a strange and persistent under-taste. I’m sure on holiday in Samoa this would be nectar, it is after all the ""Special"" and not the normal. Comes in a 24oz 750ml bottle, and is good to get you from sensible to a bit squiffy on a bulk over substance thing."

The Twisted Hop Harvest Pale Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;The Twisted Hop;This beer sticks in the memory (and that is how I am reviewing it, it has been about two years since it was brewed). I assisted in the picking of the hops, the bulk of which came from the side of the brewery walls. I can remember the grassy resins that stuck to my hands and the pleasant feeling of falling sleep six times as I sifted out hops that were too green. The scent of lupulin on my hands is just the same as the aroma that came from a freshly poured pint. It was a grassy punch in the face on a lovely light amber beer. One sided toward the use of hops, but something well remembered.
The Twisted Hop Harvest Pale Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;The Twisted Hop;Tasted 12/07/2007. Flagon, courtesy of BozoNZ. Cheers! Copper, huge hop haze, creamy off-white head. Hop character, on the nose, is tropical fruit, stonefruit, a little metallic and a touch of dry grass. A little caramelly malt pokes through too. Good malty weight in the mouth, low cask-style carbonation, carries through more of that intense fruity hop flavour - mostly stonefruit here - with a slightly muddled malt character. Some hoppy phenolics in the mouth. One for the truly crazy hopheads but a bit too much for me.
The Twisted Hop Harvest Pale Ale;Christchurch, New Zealand;Pale Ale - English;The Twisted Hop;Pint at the brewery. I love this. Beautiful copper hues and the typical full creamy ’Hop head. Big grassy resinous and a dash of citrus aromas. Same goes for the flavours. Something truely beautiful with interest and complexity. Get one before it runs out.

The Livery Bourbon Barrel Aged Liverator Doppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;Tap: Looks like muddy swamp water, deep shitty brown color with a light-tan collar around the top.

The Livery Bourbon Barrel Aged Liverator Doppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;Enjoyed on the bus to Bell’s during RBSG. Deep amber pour with a sticky white head. The nose is lightly fruity. A sort of salty character along with a lot of bourbon on the nose along with some nice oaky contribution. Toasted oak, light vanilla and a little bit of lightly lactic tartness. A touch of dark funkiness going on as well as a bit of the light fruit. Pretty nice stuff although its hardly doppelbock anymore.

The Livery Cask Aged Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;Tasted at RBSG/MBGSF ’10 from notes. Pours a hazy caramel brown color with a small off white head.

The Livery Cask Aged Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;This bottled brew from rbsg poured a head of frothy fine to medium sized tan colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a no visible carbonation hazy brown colored body and a fair lacing. The funky aroma was woody. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of old ale wood and citrus. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.
The Livery Cask Aged Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;On tap at The Livery. Pours a hazy amber color with a thin off-white head and not much lacing. The nose carries some light notes of hops plus a bit of oak and a mild sourness. Fairly pleasant, though a bit odd. As it warms, an unfortunate acetic character comes through. The flavor is about the same--starts out with a moderate pleasing sourness along with a few hoppy notes and then gets hit pretty hard with some acetic character, which is then very, very apparent in the finish. Pretty cool concept, though it went a bit astray. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 05-07-2011

Finishes tangy and lightly bitter with a dab of pecan praline.
The Livery Cask Aged Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;"Keg on the RBSG 10 Bells/Dark Horse bus ""Barrel Aged Hoppelbock"" Pours a gorgeous rich brown with a fantastic fluffy head. Aroma is aggressive acidic, nice bright fruit, some hop bitterness, piney, light cheese. Flavor follows, super aggressive but extremely drinkable, plenty of acidic and bright fruit played against strong hop bitterness and some cheesiness. Super crisp sharp carbonation. Very sour, extreme, hides the 10% so well."
The Livery Cask Aged Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;Pouring at the Michigan Brewers Festival during RBSG. I have this down as “Barrel Aged Hoppelbock” and “Sour Doppelbock” in my notes as well. Which leads me to believe this is a separate version and is not on the site. But as I don’t have enough accurate info, I’ll leave it to someone else to tidy up the mess that this listing seems to be. Pours a hazed brown with a thin to medium sized beige head. Nice big balsamic vinegar and sour malt, some light fruitiness. Nice tannic and tart bitterness, tart vinegar and toast.
The Livery Cask Aged Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;MBGSF 2010. Poured a clear dark copper color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a solid beer. Earlier Rating: 7/31/2007 Total Score: 3.5 Draft sample at MBGF07. Poured a hazy copper color with an average frothy off-white head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Moderate sour citrus hop aroma. Medium body with a slick texture. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bitter finish of moderate duration. Drinkable brew that I would recommend to a freind.
The Livery Cask Aged Hoppelbock;Benton Harbor, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Livery;Fliptop bottle courtesy of Derek. Version aged in wine barrels I believe. Pours a deep, slightly hazy amber with a big bubbly head that recedes to a thick collar and leaves spotty lacing. The aroma has some clean, crisp caramel malts with some sweet apples and toasted bread. But the most interesting aspect is the lightly sour, vinous aroma with hints of sour cherries and oak. Interesting. The taste is even more sour with the initial taste being the tart cherries and acidic barrel character. The caramel malts and bread are present in the background but it’s less prevalent than the dry wine-like presence. The finish is dry and oaky with a red wine presence. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated with a dry tannic presence and a bit of funk. This is a different take on a doppelbock with the uniqueness of the wine barrel really taking things in a different direction. Another interesting from The Livery.

Pours a hazy golden color. Head is medium to big, white and creamy. It leaves a nice, steady film. Aroma is very nice, fruity with notes of butter, berries, ricotta, cream, yoghurt and pancakes. Hints of cereal grains, especially barley. Unexpectedly good. Flavor is slightly tart showing some sweetness. Buttery notes and again touches of ricotta, milk, berries, Berrie Kuchen, dough, raspberries and strawberries. Wow! Surprising, original and nice. Light to medium body, medium to low carbonation. Refreshing despite of the intense flavor. Oily texture. Finish is long and aftertaste is very agreeable. Calle Calle’s best.

Mommeriete t Is Mooi West;Gramsbergen, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Mommeriete Brouwerij;Bottled. An unclear orange beer with a thick white head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of hops, elderberries, and coriander. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of elderberries, hops, and coriander, leading to a dry straw finish.
Mommeriete t Is Mooi West;Gramsbergen, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Mommeriete Brouwerij;Thanks SoLan. Pours a murky golden color. Very spicy, hoppy nose, not what I expected at all Some back notes of hay and grass come through as well. Flavor is well balanced and graceful, with the Pilsner malts playing harmoniously with the American hops. Excellent beer.
Mommeriete t Is Mooi West;Gramsbergen, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Mommeriete Brouwerij;"Bottle... Murky, straw-colored lager with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Excellent, tight retention. Herbs and spices construct the nose (grains of paradise, coriander, English lavender) along with esters and phenols of banana, bubblegum and clove. Full-bodied and creamy with moderate carbonation. Sweet pilsner malt balanced by medium, earthy hop bitterness. Spicy, moderately bitter finish. Kudos to SoLan for providing the bottle and the late night eats from the McDonald’s ""dollar menu!"""
Mommeriete t Is Mooi West;Gramsbergen, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Mommeriete Brouwerij;Thanks to solan for sharing this one! Citrus hops, spicy, with a sligthly musty aroma. Pours a cloudy blonde with a white head. Great hop flavor, great malty crisp lager bite, and great citrus hop flavor. Great combination of an american ipa and german lager. Great beer!
Mommeriete t Is Mooi West;Gramsbergen, Netherlands;Pilsener - Imperial;Mommeriete Brouwerij;Courtesy SoLan. Thanks Alan! Pours a cloudy goldenrod hue with a small, foamy, white head. Sudsy legs mostly rejoin the body. The nose is dry, grassy, and hoppy with a bold, funky, spicy yeast profile. The flavor again benefits from an obviously aggressive dry hopping, with dehydrated grasses and herbs showing quite strong over sweet, pale malts and spicy, peppery yeast. The body is substantial, with perfect carbonation providing for a lightly prickly, fizzy feel on the tongue. Each sip makes you want more and more. A very memorable brew. Excellent.
The Beer Joint Hefeweizen;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Sampled at the NoVa Summer Beer Fest in Leesburg, VA on 6/25/11. Pours a hazy straw yellow color witha thin creamy white head. Decent head retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus and clove. The taste is wheat, citrus, clove and a tart finish. Medium bodied.
The Beer Joint Hefeweizen;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Sampled at 4th NoVA Summer Brewfest. Pours cloudy yellow with no head. Aroma is heavy malt (bread, straw, meal), light citrus hops, banana, and orange. Flavor is heavy malt with bitter orange notes and banana. Light body, warmth, and carbonation with a dry finish.
The Beer Joint Hefeweizen;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Sampled on tap at Vintage 50. Light hefeweizen aroma with standard notes of banana and clove but also a bit lemony. Pale golden straw, hazy, with thin white head. Medium watery body with fizzy carbonation. Notes of banana and lemon, yeast sourness, and yeasty finish. Mild bitter finish with yeast astringency. Mild sulfur after.
The Beer Joint Hefeweizen;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Draft. Pours a very cloudy yellow with a small creamy white head. Spicy wheat and lemon in the nose. Fairly straight forward for a hefeweizen. Medium-low carbonation with a light mouthfeel. Wheat, lemon, dust, and a light tart note that reminds me of persimmons on the palate. Medium-short finish with a little lingering citrus note. A pretty good hefe.
The Beer Joint Hefeweizen;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Sampled at V50. Beautiful cloudy golden with a white head. Great banana/clove nose - not too strong, but very nice. Lightly herbal with banana, clove/spiciness, wheat, lemon and pleasant residual sweentess. Very bright and summery. Medium smooth body with moderate, fine beaded carbonation. Quite good.
The Beer Joint Hefeweizen;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;5oz glass at the brewery. Dusty lactic nose, very inviting and distinctly lacking (in a good way) the fruit, lemon and candy aromas of so many hefeweizens. Very stiff and fluffy palate, lactic sourness is there, doughy and yoghurty, semi-crisp on the tongue, with a bit of an oily, tingling sensation in the finish. Very well made, with the right amount of sourness provided by the yeast, leaving the mouth covered in a wheaty, doughy, fresh, lively yeast flavor. Very good.
The Beer Joint Porter;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Draft from the cask. Pours an opaque, dark brown with a creamy, light tan head. Earth, caramel, coffee, roasted malt, and smokiness in the nose. Low carbonation with a medium-light mouthfeel. Dark, roasted malt, coffee, earthy bitterness, and a touch of nuttiness. A little roasty for a porter. Good drinkability though. Medium finish with some lingering bitter roastiness. Great lacing all the way down the glass. I will certainly have this one again.
The Beer Joint Porter;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;On tap Sep. 2008: Pours a barely transparent dark mahogany with a thin, wispy-lacing light tan head. Has a sweet milk chocolate nose with some roasty malty character. Body starts with good rich fullness and sweet dark caramel and chocolate flavor drying out slightly toward a lingering roasty bittersweet finish. A smooth and authentic porter.
The Beer Joint Porter;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;At Vintage 50, the cask selection. Dark, opaque brown with some ruby highlights and a wonderful, creamy light brown head that lasted well. Roasted nuts aroma, hints of coffee, and some light spice notes. Medium body, fine medium carbonation, and a mildly astringent character. Nice balance of flavors with a dark malty sweetness and just enough bitterness for a slightly dry finish.
The Beer Joint Porter;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;I dunno. I didn’t find this as something I’d come back to. maybe it was because the day was a downer and the Porter wasn’t something I had in mind. I should have picked the lager! Anyhow, nice color (although lighter than expected for a poster style) and a little roast tinge. I think Bill needs to work on this one more. (addition after being questioned by a RB member... I thought it was too thin and to subtle to wow me a s a Porter style... I think it felt too thin... nothing wrong with the taste... but for the color and flavor, it was just too thin on the mouth... but then again, you coudl write it off to being the first one tasted in the sitting that afternoon.. I’m still sticking to my rating though.. for me, my watermark is Stone Smoked.. so maybe I’m biased...)
The Beer Joint Porter;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;A tasteful and delightful porter. Pours nice and dark and creamy. Has a roasted finish that has mocha and coffee.
The Beer Joint Porter;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;"On cask at Vintage 50. Pours a very dark brown (almost black) with a dense creamy manilla head. Pleasant mocha-esque, lightly roasty nose. Flavor is very nice; prominent notes of roastiness, chocolate, mocha and sweet (but not too sweet) crystal malt underneath. Light hint of burnt toast, which I like. Light earthy hop character. Medium bodied with very slight carbonation. Very, very drinkable and tasty. Quite good overall."
The Beer Joint Porter;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Cask pint at the brewery, but it sits in the glass like it was poured with nitro, a dark muddled brown body with burgundy light at the edges, beneath a firm, one-inch thick ice cream frothy head. Incredible rich ice cream texture, the flavor is an astounding mixture of toasty grains, rich dark chocolate with the faintest bit of sharp, bitter bakers chocolate. Soft, mellow, relaxing texture, overall really rich, very flavorful and quite complex. Exactly what I want classic brown porter to taste like. The finish especially is divine, with a pasty, chalky film coating the mouth, and a lingering, rich mocha and chocolate aftertaste. One of the best porters I’ve ever had.

Pours a hazy yellow golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma and flavor have yeasty bread, fruity notes, apples, orange citrus, some spicy character, mild to moderate sweetness, just not too much to get excited about.
Midnight Sun 2007 Deadly Sins: Greed;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Otown Throwdown III. Pours a very light yellow gold- almost to that of a deep berlinner weisse look to it- thinning white head. Aroma is doughy wehat malt, bredy pils, some lemon zest, herbs, spices, moderate belgian yeasty phenolics, dirty yeast, some peppery notes. Flavor is tart, zesty, lemon-lime, earthy and peppery spices, phenolic, slight dill pickle, light crackery bready malts, dry effervescent finish. Strange- ok, but not great.
Midnight Sun 2007 Deadly Sins: Greed;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;A: The pour is a pale and hazy yellow color with a fluffy white head on it. S: A very yeasty character to the nose. A bit of fruitiness along with some mild spicy esters and a floral note along with an underlying bread aroma. T: The flavor is quite sweet and fruity, which I was not really expecting. The yeastiness is once again pronounced as are some nice orange peel and floral flavors. M: A light to medium body with very lively carbonation. D: Nothing overly exciting nor offensive about this beer. Easy to drink, but certainly not worth saving much longer.
Midnight Sun 2007 Deadly Sins: Greed;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;22oz bottle from hannont. Rating #66. Clear gold pour, although it clouded up considerably after I poured the bottom of the bottle into my glass. Sweet aroma, also a slight tomato juice like aroma as well, not sure if that’s what I was getting, but I can’t describe it better than that. Sweet light fruity flavor, very soft on the palate, good stuff. (1138)

Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);At Calgary Zoo. It pours clean pale and golden, snow-white head that lingers but a second. Aroma is almost non-existent: maybe some iron, some grass, who knows. Taste is that of sparkling water, although I like sparkling water and not this. Maybe because of the over-the-top fizziness, maybe because of the overmetallic finish. Again, who knows. Didn't like it. They say they retired it: good riddance.
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Had it in Canada, nice taste and refreshing sweet features. Some foam and reminds good moments.
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);a very disgusting beer. Tasted like a cheap american malt liquor. Not something ill ever partake of again.
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Let me just say that someone in admin should post Josh’s rating in the Quote Of The Day window! That generated a Top 3 RateBeer laugh for me! GOLDEN! Ahhh... Now about the beer: just read the reviews below and you’ll get the picture. Forgettable at best.
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);It’s like a watered down Labatts. Transparent yellow with a white head. Aroma = None. Flavor = Little. Palate = Carbonation. The alcohol content reported as 5%, which I am sure is grossly overstated.
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Gold colour,weak head,carb medium,aroma or lack of,lemon,salt air,flavour,bread like,a slight vegetable taste,mild bitter finish plus dry,tasted worse.
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);Golden clear and minimal thin head. Soapy looking in the glass. Thin, corny with less flavour then the original. Very thin and flavourless.
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);(Bottle) I’m not going to write quite as much as Josh as I really don’t want to over-think this beer. Clear, big head/ Nose is skunky (was this intensional as its from a bottle at a festival?) with a mild juniper odor. Thin milky flavour gives was to a grainery of spent, moldy grasses. Piss poor.
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);"Yowch! What weight has my review after Josh’s Opus on corporate brewing boardroom banality....the market hype for this beer may be the product of insulated executive trend mongering, but the brewer took the right direction at least in a small way...it is at least, a light/pale all-malt lager. ...decent heading, fair aroma of sweet malts ( unlike it’s sibling Kokanee which has a 25% dextrin bite and body). Problem with this beer is although it has a light malt character it is very thin in the body and watery in the mouth...of course I served it at a proper serving temp for a all malt beer about 48-50 deg. F....I suppose they(Inbev marketers) have designs of serving it as half frozen slush like Coors. So from the brewery;s accountant and brew master’s perspective you don’t want to waste a lot of good malt on a drink who’s main sales pitch is selling the taste of ice when it is served far too cold to taste...besides good malt protein just clouds up the drink at those temperatures....they want ice ya give em ice...not rich malting."
Kokanee Glacier Frost;Creston, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Columbia Brewery (Labatt - AB InBev);I thought this beer was good. Something a little different from our friends at the Columbia Brewery. It has a nice clean break, beautiful golden colour and a nice subtle hopping. This beer was also extremely refreshing.....the kind of beer that makes you want to drink more.

Hajduk Mocne;Raciborz, Poland;Pilsener - Imperial;Browar Zamkowy Racibórz;No 445 Rated: 12.07.2008 Bottle brown, 500 ml Appearance: Pours dirty - golden body, texture is perfectly clear, body carbonation is initially vivid and decreasing to medium, quite nice, head initially small to medium but totally disappearing after one minute. Aroma: Sweet malty but not dull, more clean than dusty but haveing the characteristic poor water accent, some gentle notes of herbal hoppyness and gentle alcoholic accent but well hidden as for its 7.0%, some notes of honey, rather clean, not as chalky and dull as ’Tiger Mocne’ from Browar na Jurze, some notes of banana at finish. Flavour: Wattery mouthfeel, extremely surprising in terms of its lightyness, softyness, tastes almost like champagne in terms of alcohol perception, very easy going, refreshing but seems a bit too wattery, clean, poor in terms of hops but soft and pleasant. Finish duration is short. Palate: Body is light, texture is wattery, finish feel is flat, wattery, neutral, carbonation on palate is gentle.

1420 Ale;Mendoza, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;Courtesy of Stine. Cloudy yellow color with no head. Sour aroma and taste. I think some cherry is hiding in there too. Is it trying to be a lambic?
1420 Ale;Mendoza, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;From a 10-oz bottle supplied by Stine, pours a semi-hazy golden yellow blonde brew with a fast dissolving white head that leaves no trace. Aroma of slight skonk, sour hard skinned fruits with a touch of pepper and yeast. Taste is light bodied, tart, with some flavors of green apple and front yard lawn. Finish is slightly chalky with a tart apple aftertaste. For an amber ale, this bottle may have been infected or it’s okay for a sour brew.
1420 Ale;Mendoza, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;From Stine. Maybe a bad bottle, but it is green so it is their own fault. Light skunk and sour flavor. Very light body, and light red in color. Who knows, maybe the infection helped this one.
1420 Ale;Mendoza, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;Thanks to Stine for sharing. Yellow color with no head. Skunk and sour on the nose - infection can be a good thing. No head at all. Sour apple body with a faint bit of grain.
1420 Ale;Mendoza, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;Thanks to Stine for sharing. Pours a hazy straw colored golden. Tart apple and a strawy tyoe grassiness on the nose. Unique flavor with a little tart apple and perhaps cinnamon? Kinda funky, but not terrrible.
1420 Ale;Mendoza, Argentina;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;Bottle aged one year. Perhaps a golden rather than an amber, but it’s rather indistinct. Very cloudy. Lively apple sours and spicy characteristics on the nose from a healthy thickness of yeast. Distantly foul and oxidized. A chewy green apple mash with butterscotch and nutmeg. Quiet but sprightly wheatlike quality. Dusty. Lively and dynamic palate which migrates through lactic sour and basement earth territory. An interesting creation.
1420 Stout;Mendoza, Argentina;Stout;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;Courtesy of Stine. Brown color with a medium head. Oddly salty aroma. Roasty malt flavor with a very unexpected hit of wood, smoke and a bit of cinnamon. Very nice surprise!
1420 Stout;Mendoza, Argentina;Stout;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;From a 10-oz bottle supplied by Stine, pours a cloudy dark brown brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and ring. Aroma of roasted dark malt and nuts, artifically infused smoke with some stale coffee. Taste is medium bodied, carbonated with some smoke wood with a light coffee flavor. Finish is slightly metalic with a light coffee aftertaste. Interesting brew but quite light for a stout caliper beverage.
1420 Stout;Mendoza, Argentina;Stout;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;A nice beer. The full aroma has roasted malt. Light coffee and smoke in the flavor, but it is a strange, woody smoke with a unique aroma I am not familiar with. Medium palate. Good. Thanks Stine.
1420 Stout;Mendoza, Argentina;Stout;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;Light brown color with a faint head. Faint smoke aroma with a grain character. Light wood and smoke in the body with an interesting mouthfeel.
1420 Stout;Mendoza, Argentina;Stout;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;Thanks to Stine for sharing. Pours a nice smokey burnt black. Tobacco like smokeyness on the nose, with nice toasty sweet malt and a weird almost medicinal tinge. Odd oaky flavor with hints of smoke, smoked meats, ripe fruit. Very cool, and unique.
1420 Stout;Mendoza, Argentina;Stout;Autentica Cerveza 1420 Artesenal;Deep and black appearance, quite thick. Bonfire smoke aroma with rich chocolate. A creamy, sweet body with sparks of strawberry and black licorice. Finishes dry with cocoa dust. Mildly dusty in the mouth with a rich and coating presence of smoked meats. Robust and thorough, and to my taste the most fully realized Argentinian beer yet.
Andes Porter;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Cerveza tomable, demasiado dulce a mi parecer, falta el sabor torrefacto, el café, el chocolate, el malteado... Lo que falla es el balance de la misma. Muy correcta visualmente hablando. Apenas más fuerte que la Andes lager...
Andes Porter;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);"Bought a 40oz bottle of this at a convenience store in Mendoza and enjoying it on their ""patio"" with the locals at 8:30pm on New Year's Eve, because not one other thing in the city seems to be open yet. Pours dark brown/black with a little white head. Yes - they have glasses to pour in to! Smell is carbonation and oily with a little cocoa. Taste is syrupy and cocoa and sugary. A little watery but I'm happy as a clam drinking this right now. It is the only beer this store sold, that I hadn't tried yet."
Andes Porter;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);Tastes a little sweet, and very boring. A touch of foulness but only a touch. On average better than most of the ilk Quilmes churns out. Possibly their crowning achievement. In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king... 1L bottle.
Andes Porter;Quilmes, Buenos Aires, Argentina;Porter;Cerveceria Malteria Quilmes SAICAY (AB InBev);A firm dark brown body, with some brandy shades at the bottom of the glass. Raspberry jam on rye aroma. Tastes of lactose sugars with maple syrup, and gum drops. Finishes on a very strange burnt bubblegum sensation. Chalky palate with abrasive sugar. Lightly residual. Sugar cannot fill the gap where malt should be, but this is not so poorly done.
Lancaster Turners Sunset;Lancaster, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lancaster Brewery (UK);Cask conditioned - handpump - Wig and Pen Northampton. More golden in colour if you ask me, not the chestnut the comm description suggests. Has an off-white head and lacing. The aroma is fairly hoppy but very much an English bitter. A nice balance of malt and hops in the taste. Well balanced and nicely drinkable.
Hart Temptress;Nelson, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oscars Brewery (prev Hart of Preston);Aroma: Malts, alcohol. Appearance: Deep amber. Big caramel head. Taste: Malts, porridge, wheat. Palate: Somewhat bitter throughout. Light body. Light carbonation. Overall: An average bitter. Not much to the aroma, although the taste fairs better. Not for me.
Hart Temptress;Nelson, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Oscars Brewery (prev Hart of Preston);Cask conditioned - handpump - Wig and Pen Northampton. A hazy amber coloured beer with an off-white head and lacing. The aroma is sweet and malty. A bit of bread and a bit of candy sugar. The taste is malty and has a bit of Belgian sweetness to it. Interesting.
Tajano Porter;El Monte, Chile;Porter;Tajano;Has a dark brown color and, a medium and permanent head. This beer does not smell very well, has a bad aroma. In the palate, the thing is still equal. There is something of malty, mixed with fruit-bearing flavors. But all of them are extinguished by the final acidity. Or it is a very bad, or this beer infected.
Tajano Porter;El Monte, Chile;Porter;Tajano;Appearance: Dark brown with reddish tones. Medium head, beige color and medium persistent. Aroma: Unfortunately I tasted two bottles that had infection problems, with extreme sourness. However, I recognize fruity of plums, berries and raisins. Presence of toasted cereals, smoked and sweet chocolate. Flavor: Sourness from the infection problems. Presence of toasted grains, candy, plums and berries. Palate: Medium carbonation. Light body, too much for a porter, watery texture. I hope to obtain other bottle, but without infection problems.
Black Lotus Dark Wheat;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Wheat Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Wasn’t on the menu when I had it July 4. The waitress mentioned that it was available. A nice rich wheat - almost like what Bell’s was doing with their special wheats a few years ago. I like it better than the World Wide.
Third Base 3 Baggin Blonde;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured a hazy orange color. The thin white head reduced quickly to a thin film that didn’t leave much lace behind. Aroma was of flowery, grapefruity hops. Dry and effervescent on the tongue. There was moderate hop bitterness throughout. Flavor was dominated by fruit, namely grapefruit and apricot. There wasn’t a whole lot of malt flavor other than a touch of cereal grain.
Granite City Summer Hefeweizen;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Granite City Food & Brewery;Draft in Kansas City. Light hazy golden. Medium head. Faint banana and wheat aroma. Light bodied. Average carbonation. It's average. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Granite City Summer Hefeweizen;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Granite City Food & Brewery;"Un-Muzzling Olde Muzzlehatch Ratings, #77. Draught pint at the Rockford, IL location, August 2008 - and a few times since, mostly recently last summer. Served in a pint glass of course - a corporate brewpub investing in proper glassware? HAH!...properly bright, cloudy gold, but not much head...nose of banana and clove, perhaps a bit of cardamom and vanilla, perfectly reasonable but pretty weak...decent enough flavor, on the sweet side but also displaying plenty of wheaty tartness and OK malt extraction...hints of tart cider and alcohol towards the finish, which is a bit on the thin side. If I had to describe most of GC’s offerings over the past few years in general, I’d probably say ""competent and without significant flaws but totally forgettable"" and this fits that phrase perfectly."
Granite City Summer Hefeweizen;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Granite City Food & Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the St. Cloud location.

Unfiltered and hazy with a steady white layer of foam. Spider web lacing. A nose of cloves and wheat. A hint of banana and spice.

Granite City Summer Hefeweizen;St. Louis Park, Minnesota, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Granite City Food & Brewery;Draft from the brewery/restaurant in Kansas City. Not a lot to this beer. Poured a hazy yellow color with a smaller white head. Aroma was buscuit, banana, and malts. Grass, yeast and malts in the flavor. Very thin and weak. Nothing to this beer.

Derventio Emperor's Whim;Darley Abbey, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Derventio Brewery;Bottle from cousin. Peach colour, soft froth ring, which clings perilously to glass. Smells malty... even though it’s a Golden. Taste is a bit appley, a bit tart, with some very feint tropical fruit being hinted at before the dry, floorboard tang of UK hopfield takes root, firmly. Not the best.
Derventio Emperor's Whim;Darley Abbey, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Derventio Brewery;Bottle. Orange golden colour. Aroma of citrus hops. Taste is a big surprise, quite complex. Very tangy orange tones, a bit like a belgian white beer. Reminds a bit of Hogaarden . Bitter finish. A good beer, unusual for a golden ale. Maybe hints of an IPA.
Derventio Emperor's Whim;Darley Abbey, Derbyshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Derventio Brewery;From Jan 2009: The second beer from this brewery to be reviewed by me today. Clear 500ml bottle (bottle conditioned), best before 2 Feb 09, so two weeks of its life left when drank. Poured into a straight pint glass, with very little sediment getting into the glass. Dull golden colour, slighty hazey and with a large foaming white head. This beer is all about hops, Cascade and WGV are used and they come through into the nose as soon as the bottle opens. A real English bitter taste, hoppy and dry, very impressive. Good feel to this beer, a whole lot better than the first beer I reviewed from them. One more to go (today).

Gage Roads London Best;Perth, WA, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gage Roads Brewing Company;One of my favourite styles of beer, however this was a disappointment that failed to bring all the wonderful English ale elements of subtle hopping and malt back notes to the table. It lacked flavour and complexity. Why put a special edition brew out there when it's no good? -

Aroma is mainly caramel mats with floral hops and a touch of citrus fruitiness. Tongue is bittersweet with a decent English-style hop presence. Light-medium body with a low carbonation and easy sessionability like a good English ale. Less sweet than Burleigh Brewing’s My Wife’s Bitter which this is obviously trying to replicate.
Gage Roads London Best;Perth, WA, Australia;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Gage Roads Brewing Company;From a 640ml bottle on 16/9/2012. Pours a dark copper with close to nil head. Has a moderate sweet caramel malt aroma. Flavour wise, this is very malty, with more caramel, toffee and brown sugar in the mix, with some subtly spicy hops.The body is light to medium and the carbonation average.

Thin white head. 3 Aroma: Syrupy mango, yeast. 7 Taste: Sweet mango initial taste, but quickly fades to light watery Belgian spice. No bitterness. 6 Palate: Watery body, medium carbonation. 2 O Mango is one of my two favourite fruits and this is simply a fun novelty beer. 12
Matso's Mango Beer;Broome, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Matso's Broome Brewery;It tastes like mango juice or some kind of cheap soft drink, it doesn't taste like beer at all. Nothing to write about. However if you like mangos - go ahead and give it a try.
Matso's Mango Beer;Broome, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Matso's Broome Brewery;Bottle 330ml (BB 04.04.2018). Clear golden colour without head. Aroma is definitely like mango but it smells a little bit articicially. Sweet like not beer without bitterness. it tastes like sweet drink, not like a beer. Very poor sample of fruit beer.
Matso's Mango Beer;Broome, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Matso's Broome Brewery;"330 ml bottle with twist crown cap bought at Aeon Style in Whampoa Garden, Hung Hom. Clear dull blonde colour; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy white foam which fades in 10 seconds; Good sticky lacing with near zero carbonation; Fragrant and sweet aroma of malt, with strong raw mangoes, light perfume, floral, sugar and grass; Medium sweet taste of malt, with rice, light mango, light cardboard, light floral, sugar, biscuits, very light lemon, fair bitter hops and grass; Mid to light body. Slick palate; Mouth feel is good maltyness in a slick and carbo-ish background. Mango taste is lighter than aroma suggested, with notable cardboard and rice. Light floral with pretty strong sweetness, close to cloying, with notable bitter hops and lemon to round. Double hmmm…Hoppiness is floral and grass in nose and taste; Bitterness is fair for an abrupt, mid to light astringent sweet malty finish; Fairly dry after taste. Sweet, ricey light bitter to mouth. Comments: This one’s Belgian Blonde base isn’t a good match with the already lightweight mango taste, and worse it’s cloying sweet and with obvious ricey adjunct taste. A dud!"
Matso's Mango Beer;Broome, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Matso's Broome Brewery;330ml bottle from Dan Murphy’s Melbourne. Pale gold with good head. Mango aroma. Quite sweet with mango palate but thin and a bit cloying. OK for summer drinking.
Matso's Mango Beer;Broome, Australia;Flavored - Fruit;Matso's Broome Brewery;Bottle into a standard shaker glass. Aroma strongly of mango and perhaps passion-fruit. Smells very similar to a soft drink called Pasito by Kirks here in Australia. Light to pale orange, very transparent, white head. Taste is sweet and with the aroma you definitely get mango and passion-fruit flavours. Light body, and tastes like a soft drink, with a hint (and just a hint) of beer in the background saving this from being a total disaster. As it stands - glad I tried it, but not for me - but much better than the other mango beer I tried (XXXX summer bright larger with mango - yuck).
Deisenhofener Weißbräu Weissbier;Oberhaching-Deisenhofen, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauereigasthof Weißbräu Deisenhofen;Hefig-spritziger Antrunk, das vorhandene Malz ist ziemlich süß und wirkt etwas disharmonisch mit der Hefe.

Pours a hazy, amber coloured body with some lasting foam and lacing. Light wheat aroma with citrus tartness. Wheat-based character supported by prominent cloves and caramel sweetnes.

Baird Forty-Shilling Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Scottish Ale;Baird Brewing Co.;Pours hazy dark golden with no head. Initial aroma like a bland pilsner, a bit metallic. After some sips a faint tobacco scent blends in. All flavors are light: bitterness, sweetness, acidity. Light bodied with acidic finish. (Sampled @ Nakameguro taproom February 2009)
Baird Forty-Shilling Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Scottish Ale;Baird Brewing Co.;"My Bottom Line: This featherweight of the Scottish Ale division might not muscle you into oohs and aahs, but its swift caramel malts and their bready base sure are able to converse with ease. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam surrounds the orangey glow. -Carbonation is soft and is obviously aimed at high drinkability. -its finish is rather shy, which is disappointing. -This is another Baird beer you could just pound all night. Bottle; thx Tim!"
Baird Forty-Shilling Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Scottish Ale;Baird Brewing Co.;Med mahogany color with strawberry muffins in the nose. Malty mouth with strawberry muffins. It lacks depth, but its straight forward and knows what it is at 3.2%. I only wish beer was cheaper in Japan, I would definetely drink this as a session beer.
Baird Forty-Shilling Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Scottish Ale;Baird Brewing Co.;Copper orange with a thin, light tan head. Lightly roasted malts, caramel, yeast, and bread. Body is a bit thin with a little carbonation. Flavor is light, with bready malts, yeast, some roastedness, and some sweet caramel. Pretty good brew as I’ve come to expect from Baird.

Svaneke Sommernat;Svaneke, Denmark;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Svaneke Bryghus;Bottle. Brown / orange colour with an off-white head. Aroma is fruit, malt, caramel. Flavour is caramel, malt, fruit. Easy drinkable beer that needs more.
Svaneke Sommernat;Svaneke, Denmark;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Svaneke Bryghus;Bottle. Pours a quite golden, clear body with a small off-white head. Pleasant fruity, caramel aroma. The flavor is a bit butterscotchy and metallic, but there’s also the fruit and caramel found in the aroma. Surprisingly bitter in the finish, I don’t think that suits the beer, it sort of breaks with the rest of the impression. Some metallic notes too. Medium mouthfeel with a good carbonation. Easy to drink, quite quenching but a bit boring and lacking complexity. Not that I expected a complex beer, but something more is needed. (080402)
Svaneke Sommernat;Svaneke, Denmark;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Svaneke Bryghus;Bottled. A hazy amber beer with a tan lazing head. The aroma is sweet malty with notes of caramel and straw, leading to a slightly bitter finish. The body is thin.

Nice deep amber copper color with a nice white head at pour. Carbonation sticks around a bit & lacing stays on glass nicely. Some nice caramel & malty hints with some hops bitterness-a bit of cereal and toasty taste. I like the various flavors in this, but I wasnt really overwhelmed compared with some of their offerings. Needless to say, I definitely enjoyed it & will try it again.

Dry Dock Smoked Porter;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dry Dock Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Very smokey smell, surprisingly mellow smoke test, very lingering. Great beer
Dry Dock Smoked Porter;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Pour on tap at the brewery, dark black pour with tan head, aroma brought notes of roast, smoke, campfire, nice chocolate and bacon like notes, hints of roast, coffee, some slight caramel, hints of a slight spice. Taste is a mix of caramel, roast, chocolate, mixing into coffee and campfire notes, slight bacon like notes, hints of earth, spice, slight nutty note, finishing fairly bitter. Not bad.
Dry Dock Smoked Porter;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dry Dock Brewing Company;"Tap @ Dry Dock on 1/14. Pour is dark brown/black. Aroma of a PDQ roller grill station - kind of faint cleaning chemical, gas, cooked meat, and old coffee grounds - and smoke. Taste was of smoke, toast, and a hint of nuts. Decent smoked porter; would go well with BBQ."
Dry Dock Smoked Porter;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dry Dock Brewing Company;Cask conditioned – gravity dispensed: Deep brown with chestnut hues. Off-tan head quickly fizzles into a wispy collar. Tobacco, roasted malt, peppery hops and yeast accompany the aroma. Touches of bready smoke and berry-like esters. Poorly conditioned and light in body. Prickly carbonation. Grainy and slightly alcoholic with a tannic tingle. Rather limp/underattenuated with flabby grains and abundant wetness and yeastiness plaguing the flavor and texture. Milk chocolate is lush and adds some bulkiness to the body but it carries a bit too much weight, as does the yeast. Hints of nutty malt and smoked bread poke through, but the smoke sorely lacks pronunciation. Fuzzy malts and a cola-like sweetness exaggerate the muddled and unclean nature. Finishes slightly bready yet persistently muddled, wet and unrefined with lingering yeast and soggy grains. Went in hoping I would love this, as DD serves up some solid dark beers (foreign stout and coffee-infused oatmeal, in particular), but this doesn’t wet my whistle. Lack of carbonation fails to displace any of the flabbiness and the carbonation drops out of solution immediately as it meets the palate. It’s also astringently yeasty and the malt extraction is subpar. Perhaps the next batch will show improvement?
Dry Dock Smoked Porter;Aurora, Colorado, United States;Porter - Smoked;Dry Dock Brewing Company;cask at the brewery a couple weeks back. i thought i had washed these notes with my pants, but apparently not. dark brown ish black from the cask. coffee scent, similar to used grounds. the roast comes through with some cocoa in the nose also.thin mouthfeel, a bit of acrid smoke/wood taste with light hints of chocolate. some caramel in the finish. light smoke throughout this, although i thought more wood than smoke. a bit oily for me.
York Peaches & Cream;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask Handpump at the Brunswick Inn, Derby 10/08/2008 Some hop aroma. Golden coloured smooth on the palate and a little fruity with a hint of dryness in a crisp malt finish.

Rock Bottom Desert Ridge The Hammer K9 Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Rock Bottom Desert Ridge;Tap on Father’s day event 2007 Aroma was not much diferent than an ordinary beer out of a can. Yellow body with white head. Had a lemon citrus flavor with some bitterness. some acidity on the palate but when it is over 100 degrees any beer no matter the number is a decent refreshment.
Rock Bottom Desert Ridge Hells Bock;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Rock Bottom Desert Ridge;Tap on Father’s Day 2007. Aroma had a light sweet sense on the nose. Darker gold body with white head. Flavor was sweet and somewhat over bitter for me. Any beer is good as long as you have a good luch to go with it like I did.

Tuckerman 6288 Stout;Conway, New Hampshire, United States;Stout;Tuckerman Brewing Company;Pours a solid dark brown color with a decent sized tan head that shows some persistence. Smells roasty and fruity with bits of earth and caramel strewn about. Taste follows the smell fairly well, but there is more caramel than coffee and roast. Dark dried fruits and caramels are quite prevalent almost dopplebock like qualities. Medium to thick body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet burnt sugary mouthfeel. This is not a bad beer, but it really needs some more roast and some chocolate flavor would help as well.
Square One Honey Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Square One Brewery;Half pint glass at the brewpub. A clear golden beer. Some nice clove and a bit of bubblegum in the nose.

Square One Honey Wheat;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Square One Brewery;Pours hazy yellow with a shell white head.

Some huskiness in noticeable as well. Medium / light crisp body with some very sharp carbonation. The flavor starts with rich wheat malt, hints of citrus, bits of honey and some bubblegum traits. The finish has a spiced hoppiness. An enjoyable American wheat.

Slightly smokey, salty, herbal salami-like aroma. Average to lively carbonation supports salty taste harmonically, really dry in a prickling mode, not in that soapy, grassy full-tongue depositing way. Smoked sausage and salty liquorice.

Stierbräu Weizen Hell;Vechta, Lower Saxony, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hausbrauerei Stierbräu;0,75 l bottle bought at the brewery. Nice but simple label art. Unclear and very pale yellow in the glass. Small head for a Weizen. Starts more like a Pilsener with citrus and yeast. Later getting more banana and some nuts. Also present hints of caramell.

John Harvards Monroeville Kolsch;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at Club 3000, PNC Park. Light pilsner malt aroma, with fresh hoppy notes. Golden clear with thin foamy lacing head. Medium body with medium carbonation. Fairly clean with prominent but soft pilsner malt flavor, some soft noble hops in taste and bitterness. Sweetish bitter finish with not much residue.

John Harvards Monroeville Kolsch;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a dark golden-amber with a small white head.

John Harvards Monroeville Kolsch;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at the Monroeville John Havards. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color. Beery aroma that is slightly sweet. As with many kolsch, this beer is slightly bitter and perhaps a bit watery in texture. Pretty mild for a kolsch. Medium low carbonation. At times has the feel of carbonated water. Overall, much like many inexpensive lagers I’ve had. Better and more enjoyable than Schell Zommerfest and Flying Dog Tire Bite Golden Ale, but not quite as good as Saranac Kolsch. Not bad, well behaved and mannered.
John Harvards Belgian Summer Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Sampled on draft this beer poured a hazy amber color with a small white head.

Surprisingly full bodied. Nice.
John Harvards Belgian Summer Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at the Monroeville John Harvard. Pour is almost orange, cloudy like an unfiltered wheat. Very nice looking with very little head, just a creamy girdle. Aroma of a good spiced wheat beer, lots of spices whamming the olfactory. Initial taste is very spicy also, Comes across like a highly spiced wheat beer of some sort. Very low creamy carbonation. The spices in this brew make it a bit one sided. Leaves a palate that is mostly the taste of coriander. Some pepper can be detected. Cannot taste any fruit or lemon peel in this brew. I like wheat brews but this seems to come across as a wheat imitation. Not nearly as enjoyable as Jolly Pumpkin Bam Biere or Yards Saison. You would not know this was a 6.5% beer when drinking it, it is well hidden.

Bad Münstereifeler Landbier;Bad Münstereifel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Kleines Eifeler Brauhaus;Half-litre flip-top bottle: best before 30 Jan 2012. Poured into an Abbot Ale glass tankard @ home on 5th Nov 2012. Pale golden body, bright, clean and very clear: full, deep snow white head on top, which turned into a wisp and collar after a while. Nose of grains and a hint of bread yeastiness: grassy with the grains and a whiff of biscuity/shortbread maltiness. The taste was delicate and difficult to nail down: grains again, some hop bitterness towards the finish and a crisp, tangy body feel throughout, all added up to a pleasant lunchtime beer. Can’t pretend it was full of flavours, but it did test my tasting skills as I tried to pick up on the make up of the brew. Half way down the beer I had some peppered German Salami, Tomatoes and White crusty bread with the beer and they complimented each other nicely. The review was written before my taste buds got hit by the salami by the way!

Nach dem öffnen der Flasche kommt erst ein essigähnliches Aroma, das sich zum Glück schnell verflüchtigt und dem Hopfen Platz macht. Sehr dünner Antrunk.

John Harvards London ESB;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On nitro at the John Havards in Monroeville. Very light root beer color and head, quite a show when it is poured. Big creamy white head like off white whipped egg whites. Slight fruity aroma. On the first taste I can’t help but notice there is no carbonation, totally flat, like other nitro widget bitters I’ve had such as Boddingtons. Reminds me a bit of something like watered down Guinness. Slight hops in there but not excessive. Interesting variation on this style. Very nice lacing on the sides of the glass. I can’t get used to the palate of these flat brews. Overall, probably would not purchase again. Cannot stand up to the enjoyability of Hobgoblin but is on par as far as enjoyability goes with Boddingtons.
John Harvards Dunkel Weiss;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at the Monroeville John Havard. Pretty dark and hazy. Has a slight fruity smell. The aroma is overly spiced, more so than most wheat beers. The initial taste is a little tart and sour then it fades to mostly wheat beer spices, overly spiced. The spices in this brew make it pretty single minded, spices are overwhelming the subtleties of the wheat. Very similar in taste as the Belgian Summer Ale Saison and JH Weizenbock. They must have used the same spice recipe for both. Good tingly mild carbonation. Has some roasty hints in there and perhaps I do detect a little chocolate during the session. Cannot taste any bananas due to the overwelming coriander and clove spices. I’m a wheat beer lover but this JH wheat has a bit too much spice for my girlie taste buds. Finish has a lasting medium low alky industrial bitterness on the back of the throat.
John Harvards Blackbeery;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;From old notes +++ Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a cloudish reddish tan color with a medium sized foamy off white head that left good lacing.

Long tart berry, sugar and bread finish. Medium body. Solid.
John Harvards Blackbeery;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at the Monroeville John Havard. Nice purplish hazy hue with a somewhat pink head. Quite attractive in appearance and aroma. Smell is like sweet blackberries. Not quite as sweet as I expected but there is very little if any bitterness in this brew. Quite interesting and nicely fruity. Best JH beer I’ve had so far. I’m told this is a flavored kolsch, but it has very little in common with their kolsch, this is much more enjoyable and drinkable. It is interesting and much better than the majority of fruit beers I’ve had in the past. Could be a good session brew. Good medium carbonation. Not bad, finish is mild mannered and acceptable again with no lingering bitterness.

John Harvards Old Willy IPA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;I quite enjoyed this one - dark copper, nearly amber - a nice english style ipa, with a strong, american-style hop profile - quite malty up front, but it dries out really quick - the hops work extremely well with biscuity and crackery british malts - the beer manages to stay both malty and dry - overall extremely refreshing, and a wonderful take on a british style ipa.
John Harvards Old Willy IPA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Tap at JH. For the record, we chose to add this beer to the Lake Grove location not in an effort to extend our rating dominance but in the name of consistency or perhaps more accurately my extremely mild but still present obsessive/compulsive tendencies. Aroma of bitter, spicy hops, caramel malt. Flavor again has solid caramel/toffee malt and solid bitterness, but not a whole lot of character or nuance coming from either source. Malty and hoppy, solid, tasty, but not too much going on.
John Harvards Old Willy IPA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at JH. Pours a clear deep amber with a small white head. Aroma of caramel and bready malt, light fruits. Flavor is definitely very malty with a sweet finish. Palate is a touch thin. Where are the hops??? Yeah, this is an English IPA, but it is still overwhelmingly malty. A decent drink though. 7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)
John Harvards Old Willy IPA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at Club 3000, PNC Park. Nice hoppy aroma, fresh and grassy. Mild malt caramel. Dark amber clear with a bit of haze, topped with off-white creamy lacing head. Medium body and carbonation and easy drinking. Starts with caramel malty character, good sweetness before the grassy fresh hops come, juicy and bitey. A bit of harsh grapefruit bitter at the end, but otherwise finely balanced and very refreshing.
John Harvards Old Willy IPA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a dark caramel-amber color with a small khaki head. The aroma was sweet grapefruit. The flavor was bitter grapefruit with a light sweet nutty malt base underneath and a long grapefruity finish. Nice.
John Harvards Old Willy IPA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;"On tap at Kelly’s Bar, Pittsburgh. This beer is a part of the supposed ""Wet Hop Festival."" Dubbed Fresh Hop IPA for this version with ""wet hops."" From Steve Sloan, head brewer at John Harvards: ""The fresh hop IPA was basically our Old Willy IPA that was ""wet-hopped"" with 22 lbs of freshly picked cascade hops from Pedersen Farms in Upstate NY. This gives the nice floral character to the beer. We normally ""dry hop"" the IPA with 6 lbs of previously kilned hops which gives the beer a more citrusy quality. A good amount of caramel malt is added to the IPA to balance the high bitterness (80 bitterness units) from the use of 5 different varieties of hops during the brewing process, thus resulting in a sweeter version of IPA. Alcohol by volume is approx. 6.5%"" Dark caramel ruby, off white head. Aroma is tangerine, kiwi, caramel, vanilla (quite smooth and sweet). Flavor is hoppy with walnuts, maple syrup ice cream and some lingering bitterness. Quite an unusual flavor."
John Harvards Old Willy IPA;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;This is undoubtedly the darkest IPA I have ever sampled. Quite an impressive appearance for an IPA. At first I thought perhaps it come from the wrong tap. Dark brown and hazy, looks something like a dunkel weizen! After one taste however, I knew this was an IPA, no mistake. The floral hops aromas are also outstanding. Tho an IPA, it is a little milder than most. Not quite as brutal in the chewy oppressive grapefruit rind arena. But surely, this is IPA, not APA. I would imagine that most heavy duty IPA lovers will rate this low due to it’s mildness, but I find it rather acceptable. Probably one of the more mannered IPAs I’ve had the pleasure of tasting. I would put this on par with the likes of Bells Two Hearted, Magic Hat Hi PA, Tröegs Nugget Nectar Ale and Victory HopDevil, but this is just my humble opinion.
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;On draft from brewery, pours hazy yellow with little head to it, has aroma of orange and ginger, has a slight taste of mustard to it, pretty good though!
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;Tap. Hazy yellow orange pour. White head. Orange and coriander all over the aroma and taste. Very good summer beer.
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at the brewery after what looks like a long hiatus - Pours hazy yellow with a small white head that doesn’t stick around too long. Wheat and light orange peel on the nose, with a touch of lemon. Fresh and crisp. Taste has light spice up front--coriander and an herbal note, with light wheat. Finishes with a touch of bitterness. Nicely carbonated and smooth, with a decent body. Not my favorite style--if I want a lot of these flavors I’d rather have a German hefe--but not too bad.
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;Pours a cloudy pale yellow. Aroma is very spicy and heavy citrus as well. Flavor is very spicy and nicely bitter. Long dry finish. Creamy texture, medium bodied. Seems to have too big of a coriander element
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;Another style that does nothing for me. A murky amber body under a foamy white head gives off aroma of citrus zest, Chinese parsley, ripe wheat, Belgian yeast. The flavor replayed the aroma in a pleasant manner.
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;The style spices come through,corriander and orange peel blend nicely,tase dominated by the slightly sharp orange peel whith plenty of wheat tang, a somewhat harsh astringent finish. A good example of this somewhat unexciting style
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;Easily my least favorite Tyranena beer to date. Pours a cloudy hazy strawish yellow. Very spicy nose with a good dose of citrus as well. The palate is somewhat creamy, but a little too aggressive on the spicing.
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;Lightly spice wheat nose. Faint head. Cloudy lemonade yellow body. Corriander, peaches, wheat, and a smooth finish. Thanks to Skyview.
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;From Skyview’s growler. A good, but not great wit. As badgerben pointed out, this beer is dominated by coriander, perhaps too much of it, both in the aroma and the flavor. Perfect appearance for the style, cloudy and almost white with a tall head. Some spices in the flavor, citrus, and a finish with butter taste.
Tyranena Belgian-Style Wit;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Tyranena Brewing;A growler courtesy of Skyview. You rule! Very hazy and cloudy yellow color with a medium head. Aroma of oranges and coriander. Taste is mostly peach and oranges, then it is bombarded by coriander. Massive coriander. Not my bag at all, though likely great for the style.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at the brewery. Wild yeast with an amber coloured body and distinct blueberry flavour. Slightly sour, bitter even, interesting drinkability. Lots of lace. Neither too funky or fruity so it is good for all.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;On tap at brewery, pours a dark brown with a thick off white head and lacing in the glass, the aroma is of sour blueberries with some sour notes mixed in, the flavor has a touch of bourbon on the front end with a ton of funk mixed in with the blueberry with a dry finish, overall this is an odd one but I really enjoyed it.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;Pours dark brown on tap at GLBF, thin off white head. Aroma is odd, bourbon, sweet and slightly tart blueberries, and some dark roasted malt. Taste is pretty good for the crazy concoction that this is, some sweet blueberry up front, touch of tart leads into bourbon, some grainy sweet, and back into the blueberries for a sweet finish.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;Sampled from the tap at the 2010 GTMW. Poured brown with a purple hue and a near white head that dissipated to the edges. Aroma had a strong tart blueberry note with a bit of underlying bourbon. Flavor was similar with tart blueberries through out, a bit of sweet grain and the bourbon didn’t really meld with the blueberries.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;Dark off brown pour w/ a tall thick well laced tan head. Pal is to thin hints of water. ARoam is light for the style a touch of funk some berry skins notes of earthyness, a touch of vanilla and bourbon. Mellow well blended flavor w/ a touch of earthy blueberries a light dry wood on the tongue and ahint of butter and bourbon in the finish. Ok brew
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;I am very sensitive to bourbon in my beer, but gladly there wasn’t all that much of it here, though some in the aroma. Not much alcohol presence. Aroma and flavor have yeast and real blueberry. Moderate malt, but it is dry grain malt character, and lightly roasted. Just a hint of sourness. If a brewer finds a way to get real blueberry flavor into a beer, I will probably like it. Definitely not a lambic.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;at GTMW ’09. pours auburn white head. nose is mild blueberry. flavors are blueberry, caramel, spritzy and mildly tart.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;GTMW 2009. Poured a clear amber color with an off white head. Nice aromas of tart blueberry, black pepper, subdued cider vinegar, and oak. Medium bodied with light acidity. Lots of oak flavor with black pepper and subdued notes of fresh blueberry and toffee. I liked this one more than I had anticipated.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;&#40Draught&#41 Pours a lightly hazy dark amber with a small beige head. Aroma of blueberry, grass, caramel, wood, horseblanket, and light vanilla. Flavor of blueberries, bread, caramel, vinous, and some wood in the finish.
Tyranena Glenn & Debs Bourbon Barrel-Aged Blueberry Kinda-Lambic;Lake Mills, Wisconsin, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Tyranena Brewing;GTMW 09. Well, the trend is safe for the taste thus far. I was REALLY looking forward to this and was COMPLETELY disappointed. Not much to write about. Nothing but bourbon suspects &#40vanilla, oak, vinousness&#41 and blueberry. No sourness and no light refreshing chracter like I’d want in a lambic. Just heavy alcohol.
John Harvards Chill Pils;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at the John Harvards in Monroeville. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color, appearance and head. Just plain beer aroma, not much more. The taste of this begins with a somewhat IPA impact. This is more like a well hopped APA and not like a pilsner, but I’m more familiar with those mild pilsners, this stuff really got some personality. Medium low carbonation. A little too much impact for my girlie taste buds. The finish of this is also quite lasting and hoppy bitter. It leaves that citrus rind bitter taste in the back of your throat. JH Kolsch is much more mild than this and has more manners.
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Appearance: A deep-orange brown body with a healthy 2-3 finger head. Body is quite hazy with a dark brown cloud right in the middle of it that slowly goes upward. Lots of lacing left on the side of the glass. Digging the look of this brew. Smell: Not as strong as i would have liked but a good resinous hoppy aroma with a dose of malt. A bit of orange & pine thrown into the mix. Taste: Malt hits me first mixed in with a nice edge to it. Slowly leaves the place to a surprisingly sweet taste. Good dollop of hops but not overdone. Has a sugary aspect to it. Finishes with a spice-like bite and a good piney aftertaste. Mouthfeel: Very smooth with an medium body. Good balance but i found it ended just a little bit thin for my taste. Bitterness isn’t quite up there for a 100 IBU beer. It’s still quite good in the palate though.
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;I haven’t had Humulus Ludicrous in 3 or more years and this year Half Pints brought it back to their new taproom. It was delicious, a citrusy, grapefruit and piney Double IPA that was actually too easy to drink. This year’s batch certainly wasn’t as harsh yet still full on flavour on bitterness as most years, which I liked.
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Dark amber pour with some nice tan head. Aromas are citrus and grapefruit. Taste is also grapefruit but tastes more tropical. Taste is nicely balanced. Dry hoppy finish. Amazing DIPA
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Rating #1274 - 12 oz on draught at Beer Revolution 8.5%. Pours a darker amber, with a bubbly tan head. Aroma is citrusy, grapefruit hops predominant. Taste is extremely hoppy, lots of cool citrus notes - mild tropical, mild pine, mild orange zest. Extraordinarily balanced - the sweet met with doses of bitterness, and they all linger into the finish. Superbly done.
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Bottle: Dark, brownish-amber with a small, off-white head. Orange, spicy, lactic scent. Taste is creamy, orange malt, resin, berry....a little breadheel. Very fruity...sweet....solid pine/peel hopping.... Really good....big hopping, but not just a tossed together bomb.
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Hazy orange with a white head. Aroma is pineapple, citrus peel, hint of pine, honey. Medium-full bodied, bittersweet on the palate with a lingering bitter finish. Taste is cooked pineapple, pine, citrus peel.
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Bottle. Lactic orange malt and pine/grapefruit peel aroma. Hazy amber with large off white head. Sweet ripe orange malt and strongly bitter grapefruit peel flavor. Nice body.
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Bottle thanks to VanJamer, thanks Jamie! Pours a hazy copper with a thin creamy white head that sticks to the side of the glass nicely. Nose is of piny hops, resinous. There is also some slight caramel in the background. Taste is more bitter than sweet but still very well-balanced to me. Flavors of fruity hops, caramel and resin. Finish is slightly herbal and bitter. Body is medium and carbonation medium-high and drying. Overall a nice double IPA, I’d drink that again (in a smaller bottle, hopefully).
Half Pints Humulus Ludicrous;Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Half Pints Brewing Co.;Deep copper amber, with small white head. Leaves some lacing. Aroma is pine, resin and slight citrus. Taste is rich caramel, molasses, some maltiness. Finishes with a long, astringent bitterness. Full bodied, soft carbonation. Excellent.

John Harvards La Prima Espresso Vanilla Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Had this a few months ago at John Harvard’s in Monroeville... since I am finally rating on here I had to put my 2 cents in... This was by far my fav porter to date... strong bitter espresso flavor with a nice strong balance of vanilla... I had high expectations and was not disappointed... Def a shame I will never get to have this beer again...
John Harvards La Prima Espresso Vanilla Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;Sampled on draft at the Monroeville PA location this beer poured a very dark brown color with a small khaki head. The aroma was light sweet vanilla. The flavor was strong artificial vanilla with an undertone of dryish and bitter malts. There really was no coffee flavor to this and an awful lot of vanilla. The body was somewhat thin. The finish was very long vanilla.
John Harvards La Prima Espresso Vanilla Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at the Monrowvilee John Havards. Dark like root beer. Head at first then fades to nothing. Has a sweet mild vanilla cream like aroma. No trace of beer in that smell. Almost has a candy like hit on the olfactory. Taste is immediately like cold black Irish cream coffee. However, it is not overwhelming in the bitter department like many coffee porters. This is for the most part enjoyable and easily appreciated. There is a building coffee bitterness on the back of the palate with each sip. Probably the most impressive beer I’ve had at John Havards. Again, this stuff is like drinken a cup of iced black coffee. Tho the vanilla is very present in the smell, I can only detect a hint of it in the flavor. This java porter taste more like coffee than any other coffee porter I have tasted to date. Good porter entry from JH.
Takenaka (Hikos Milky) Junmai Nigori Sake;Ishibe, KOGA SHIGA, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Takenaka Shuzo Sake Co., Ltd.;Bottle… Looks like coconut milk. I live near a cluster (ok, thousands) of coconut palms, which makes me pretty much an expert on coconut milk. Murky, white liquid that leaves a creamy coating around the edges of the glass. Not much in the way of legwork. Ethanol, grainy/rice aroma that is reminiscent of - you guessed it - coconut milk... on steroids. A touch fruity as well, but I can’t say for certain exactly what fruit or blend of fruits I smell. Medium to full-bodied with a milky mouthfeel and carbonation so gentle, it seems imagined. Semi-rich, sweet flavor of rice and coconut milk with only a suggestion of the huge amount of alcohol within. Lengthy, sweet, milky finish. I suppose the entire coconut experience could have been the power of suggestion derived from this sake’s appearance. I never quite know what to say about sake other than I like it or I don’t. I like this one.
Takenaka (Hikos Milky) Junmai Nigori Sake;Ishibe, KOGA SHIGA, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Takenaka Shuzo Sake Co., Ltd.;Pours a watery milky color. Aroma is rice, yeast and slightly fruity. Taste is smooth and milky with hints of pear and apple. Well hidden alcohol. Has a very thick and grainy texture. Finishes a little thick with a hint of sweetness. Very nice.
Takenaka (Hikos Milky) Junmai Nigori Sake;Ishibe, KOGA SHIGA, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Takenaka Shuzo Sake Co., Ltd.;Milky colour. Big balsa wood/koji nose with firm alcohol. Almost mealy texture with a big whack of alcohol. Fairly pronounced cedar and light koji. Big alcohol signature.
Takenaka (Hikos Milky) Junmai Nigori Sake;Ishibe, KOGA SHIGA, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Takenaka Shuzo Sake Co., Ltd.;"Bottle. Cloudy hazy milky. Leaves legs. Nose it nutty and sweet like almond milk. Great gritty granular texture is fun for the mouth. Thick but not chewy; excellent textural experience. Smooth. Strength is mellowed by sweet grain tastes. Distinctive flavors but the appearance and texture are what grab me most."
Takenaka (Hikos Milky) Junmai Nigori Sake;Ishibe, KOGA SHIGA, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Takenaka Shuzo Sake Co., Ltd.;This a great Nigori, it brings out the all the positive flavors that this type of sake. Its got a sweet, grainy palate with some coconut. Great
Takenaka (Hikos Milky) Junmai Nigori Sake;Ishibe, KOGA SHIGA, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Takenaka Shuzo Sake Co., Ltd.;The aroma has coconut, rice, and sugar. The appearance is milky white and still. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. It’s good.
Takenaka (Hikos Milky) Junmai Nigori Sake;Ishibe, KOGA SHIGA, Japan;Saké - Nigori;Takenaka Shuzo Sake Co., Ltd.;Rated 7/7/07. Served chilled and shaken. Cloudy white appearance. Aroma shows rice, bubblegum, vanilla, and a bit of milk. Flavor is the same, with just the faintest hint of lemon. Body is a little watery for a Nigori, but very smooth. The alcohol is well hidden. Sweet up front, with a dry finish. Excellent with spicy sushi.
Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);1/5/2019. Bottle courtesy of Boris, cheers for this little gem! Pours dark brown with a red tint and an average sized beige head. Aroma of malt, prune juice, raisins, biscuit and light syrup. Quite heavy sweetness, light bitterness.

Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);330ml bottle. Quasi black colour with small to average, frothy, fading, off-white to beige head. Quite strange, dark malty aroma, hint so fleather and shoe polish. Taste is strawy, grainy and sugary, hints of treacle, cola, rock sugar. Bad.
Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);330ml bottle. Pours dark, small pale tan head. Very light roast, distant caramel on the nose. Fairly light bodied and thin, even for a schwarzbier. Light dry roast, light caramel, coffee hints. Fairly mediocre for the style, leaving no lasting impression.
Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);330mml. bottle. Tasted on the 23/10/2018 at home.

Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);On tap somewhere. Black. Decent head. The aroma of malts is very nice and mouth watering. Unfortunately the taste doesn’t have much to meet the high expectations. Thin, watery and tastes like old leather. Still drinkable though.
Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);Tap. Light black pour with a frothy tan head. Carbo is flat. Taste and nose has malts, light roast and some weird tartness.
Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);Wie befürchtet kommt es relativ dünn daher mit etwas Kaffee und Röstung im Aroma. Leicht herb zum Schluss und wenn man ehrlich ist, beinahe geschmacklos. Das war nix.
Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);Pours out of the bottle in a deep black colour with low head and medium body. Aroma of malt. Disgusting taste of canned mushrooms’ water and malt. Got sick by drinking it.
Herforder Schwarzbier;Hiddenhausen-Sundern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Herforder Brauerei (Warsteiner);Bottle. Deep black, brown head. Smells a bit metallic, a bit roasty, toffee aromas as well. Taste is very dry, heavy bitterness, metallic aftertaste. Carbonation is rather fizzy for a Schwarzbier. Hopped too much for my taste,
Brownstone Octoberfest;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brownstone Restaurant and Brewhouse;Pours a medium golden amber color. Aromas of roast malts, caramel, and some hops. Flavors of sweet malt, wheat bread and some nice hopping
Brownstone Octoberfest;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brownstone Restaurant and Brewhouse;Would have been a nice fest bier (I believe it to be an ale, not a lager) had it any carbonation. Lots of crystal malt and gives it a toffee like flavor that finishes with some fruity esters. Not bad, but not great.
Brownstone Octoberfest;Idaho Falls, Idaho, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Brownstone Restaurant and Brewhouse;on tap-pours an off white head and mahogany color. Aroma is sweet medium/dark malt-caramel(?), dark fruit, perfumy. Taste is sweet medium/dark malt-toffee, roasty, dark fruit-cherry, secondary hops bite, medium body. OK carbonation.
Niigata Sparkling Mango;Niigata-shi, Niigata-ken, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Niigata Beer;Bottle from Brewski on 29 September 2017. If this beer was judged on looks alone then it would be in trouble as it looks like a muddy swirl of yellow amber liquid. Luckily the aroma and flavour are okay and there is plenty of mango in both.
Niigata Sparkling Mango;Niigata-shi, Niigata-ken, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Niigata Beer;Draught at the Tanabata Beer Festa Toyama, 2010. The color of a Mango Milkshake. No head, no fizz. Tangy, creamy mango nose. Thick, puree-like body with lots of mango meat. Nice mango flavor is refreshing and not too sweet. A bit of unwanted cardboard flavor too. Maybe I sense a bit of hop? Otherwise nothing like a beer, but very nice on a hot summer morning for breakfast.
Niigata Sparkling Mango;Niigata-shi, Niigata-ken, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Niigata Beer;12oz bottle from Takanaya in Tokyo. Rotten mango smell. Mango juice color and thickness. I’ve never seen a beer so thick. Taste surprises you, because you expect Mango sweetness, but it’s dry. no hops discernable over the super over-ripe mango smell. Flat, no head (despite the name). I don’t seem to like Niigata beers. it looks like they are trying to hard to be original, and not hard enough trying to be good.

Sand Creek Imperial Porter;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter - Imperial;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Brown almost black, minimal head.

Sand Creek Imperial Porter;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter - Imperial;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Bottle donated to the cause by eaglefan538...and it’s good that he did because I seemed to enjoy this much more than he did. Pour was dark with thick foamy head. A wonderful roasty/chocolate aroma. The flavor contained rich roasted malts with some sweet boozy chocolate. Well balanced and no off flavors. I thought this was quite delicious.
Sand Creek Imperial Porter;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter - Imperial;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Very dark ruby red with a one finger tan head that goes away quickly. Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, licorice with some raisons and dark fruits. Taste is pretty heavy on the licorice with brown sugar, roasted malts, alcohol, dark chocolate and notes of coffee. Pretty full bodied for a porter, goes down fairly smooth too. Moderate warming effects, overall not too shabby.
Sand Creek Imperial Porter;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Porter - Imperial;Sand Creek Brewing Company;A very good porter, thick and black. Chocolate and mollasses. Very drinkable, satisfying, a bit on sweet side.

Pours a translucent gold. Nose is slightly floral, malty and fruity with a caramel type hint in the background. Taste is slightly hoppy, malty with caramel and fruit notes. My wife said this was like their Corona, but it’s leagues better! Body is medium and has light creamy carbonation. Finishes with sweet malt notes, soft fruit, corny notes and subtle hops. Not bad at all!

Taste mirrors aroma almost exactly. Nice malt bitter finish. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation.

Extra Billy's Chocolate Porter;Midlothian, Virginia, United States;Porter;Extra Billy's Smokehouse and Brewery;From a growler. Pours black with a small tan head. Nose is dark chocolate, chocolate malts and roasty malts, and soft coffee. Taste is big coffee and dark chocolate with huge roasted malt notes.

Finishes with more dark chocolate notes, coffee, and roasted malts. Bit of burnt caramel and faint smoke as well. Nice!
Great Basin Midnight Special Schwarzbier;Sparks, Nevada, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Great Basin Brewing Company;On tap at both locations on 6/17/16, so very much unretired. My first local brewer to reach 100 rates. Unfortunately it’s for an enjoyable enough, but forgettable beer. Thin with a dry finish, lots of roasted coffee on the nose and flavor with a touch of bitterness. Just a touch too light.

Hylands Sturbridge Industrial Pale Ale;East Haven, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Pioneer Beer Company (Connecticut Valley Brewing);Sampled at the brewery. Pours hazy copper with a lacy, white head. Aroma of light citrusy and floral hops plus some pale and caramel malts and some dough. Flavor the same. Average texture. A pretty standard IPA.
Hylands Sturbridge Industrial Pale Ale;East Haven, Connecticut, United States;IPA;Pioneer Beer Company (Connecticut Valley Brewing);In short: A typical caramelized, fruity and resinous IPA. Above average How: Tap at Vermont Brewer’s Festival 2010. Simply called Pioneer Brewing IPA, I’m assuming this is the beer The look: Clear golden body topped by a small off-white head In long: The typical but always pleasant hoppy nose has citrus fruits upfront backed-up by grass. The nourishing body is well malted with plenty of cookies and luscious fruity caramel. Finish brings a round fruity and resinous bitterness that is never aggressive. Light citric notes. Nothing original. I’ve had IPAs just like this one many many times before and I hope to have many other similar examples. This is the best beer I’ve ever had from this brewery. I’m looking to trying a second one.

G.G. Brewers Smoke Gets In Your Rye;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;G.G. Brewers;Earthy caramel color with no head. Aroma of smoke, wood, and grain. Smoke flavor upfront with some caramel, grain, and smoke. Strangely, smoke flavor disappears when beer warms.

Smells woody, cereal, malt and a touch smokey. Good rye, a sweet caramel malty character and a nice smokey finish. Kind of dry actually, in a nice way. A safe session beer.

Taste of varnish, some sugar syrup, a hint of nuts and subtle grassy hops. Light bodied and flat carbonation. A dry, varnished bitterness in the finish. No aroma or flavour, just varnish!

Quartz Crystal;King’s Bromley, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Quartz Brewing;"Cask at the Bishop Vesey; this beer manages to achieve a zero smell and an insipid taste, flavour does consist of boiled vegetables, on the plus size it does have an appearance of light amber with a thin white head."
Quartz Crystal;King’s Bromley, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Quartz Brewing;500ml bottle from Heart of England Fine Foods, Shrewsbury. Quite a distinctive taste despite being a month out of date with some chewy bits (not due the shop, mind.. rather my unorganised beer shelf!) Some liquorice residue with a slight caramel character. Possibly more so in bottle form, judging by the comments below.
Quartz Crystal;King’s Bromley, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Quartz Brewing;"Bottle. Light bronze with quickly fading offwhite head. Nose is sickly caramel with a little nuttiness. In the mouth, there is a surprising slickness, then some light sweet maltiness and not much else. It’s quite ""lagerish"" to that end. Thirst quencher of decent quality. But no taste-bud exciter."
Quartz Crystal;King’s Bromley, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Quartz Brewing;Light brown. Quite high carbonation kills the head. Aroma has malts and wood and is also a bit perfumed. Flavour has a dry, woody feel but also some red fruit sweetness. Overall a bit too sweet.
Quartz Crystal;King’s Bromley, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Quartz Brewing;Bottle. Bronze with a small head. Some fruitiness and a trace of hops. Pleasant and easy to drink.
Quartz Crystal;King’s Bromley, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Quartz Brewing;"1) Bottle from Dobbies....you couldn’t say conditioned. Slops headless copper with a brief fizz of foam. Buttered dandelion aroma. Alarming, slightly brackish taste at first; some half-decent liquorice and digestive notes amongst the varnished wood, fatty walnut, raw mushroom and chlorine weirdness. Barely drinkable. 524210. 2) Cask handpull as ’Dadlington Hamlet’, The Dog and Hog, Dadlington. Copper-gold with a tight white drum of foam. Mellow apple peel English orchard fruit and biscuit character, sprinkle of demerara. Yeast and bread. Weak pear nose, boiled sweets. Decent. 636313."

Amber Summer Bock;Ripley, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Amber Ales;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 06-07-07. Poured copper in colour and with a slight sulphur nose. This had a strange taste a tiny edge of smokiness was there as was a very thin almost nothing taste for a bit, I’m not familiar with this style at all but will go with what Glen say’s that this isn’t really a true Bock, in truth it wasn’t really making an impact with me whatever box it needed to sit in, as it tasted far too shallow for my liking.
Amber Summer Bock;Ripley, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Amber Ales;Cask conditioned at Merton beer Festival ’07. Copper colour with thin head. Dry, quite chalky, powdery malty body with a definite alcohol note despite the lowish ABV. I really tried to fit it into a Bock category, but failed, not really a bitter either but it had to go somewhere. Not much finish to it for me, obviosly too delicate for my palate, ho hum.
Mighty Oak Caught Short;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Gravity, Merton Beer Festival. Ultra pale yellow gold, small but viscous white head. Vanilla, blended with an elegant fruit cake aroma. Fine textured, fresh bitterness, a bit of vanilla here too, along with berries and a nice toasty finish. I got the last half pint the cask had to offer (needed a little coaxing to get that), but it sure doesn’t seem to have suffered a bit.
Mighty Oak Caught Short;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 06-07-07. This beer poured a light golden colour with a pretty bubbly white head topped off with an aroma of gentle hops. The taste started with a quick burst of vanilla that then subsided and in fact I never picked up again but was followed by pleasant fruitiness and nice malty flavours a lovely beer that was very popular and the first to sell out.
Mighty Oak Caught Short;Maldon, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;Cask conditioned at Merton Beer festival ’07. Gold amber with white head. Another Mighty Oak beer and maybe similar to the others but still pretty decent too. Fruity bitter, rich malts and a green hoppy finish like freshly mown grass. Good stuff.

Nicely hoppy in a flowery fashion, but the breadiness stays upfront, at times taking a ricey leaning. Let’s call it pooridge-like rather, but the thing is that it is unfocused in maltiness and quite oily in mouth, the whole of which feels rather heavy as alcohol fumes overtake the finish.

Cloudy medium brown colour, a bit over primed but great lacing. Big steely malt flavous to my tatste. Thinnish but good lingering malt and tingling steely hop finish.

Dark Isle Triple Malt;Hobart, Australia;Tripel;Dark Isle Brewery;This was the hardest craft brewer to find while I was in Tasmania. I’d ask about it everywhere I went, but more then half of people hadn’t even heard of it! Finally a helpful publican pointed me in the right direction, and I was able to purchase the second-last mixed sixpack of Dark Isle brews from a 9-11 bottleshop on Davey Street in Hobart. This one poured a hazy chestnut colour with a modest eggshell head. Right from the start this seems a little overcarbonated. Aroma is sweet and fruity, berries come to mind. This beer feels thin and fizzy in the mouth, and this really seems to steal away any structure the dark malts may provide, and this beer ends up being a mouthful of fruity caramel blandness. When I came to rate it I was surprised at its designation as a belgian strong ale (there is no mention or hint of what style this is on the bottle, other than the claim of using five different malts). It is worth stating that I have no idea how fresh this sample is as there was no best-before date on the bottle or the carton.
Dark Isle Triple Malt;Hobart, Australia;Tripel;Dark Isle Brewery;330 ml bottle - Slightly hazy Deep red/amber colour. Off white head which does not persist. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Sweet rich and malty with fruity citris flavours including a touch of apple and A strong taste of alcohol coming through in the finish. It could do with a little more biterness (for my taste)

Monkey King Stuart Inlet Amber;Stuart, Florida, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Monkey King Brewery & Floribbean Grill;Pours beautiful deep gold to amber in color. It is just a rich clear deep copper color with thin off white head. The aroma is light with sugariness going along with faint malt roastiness and a hint of hops.

The finish and after taste contains mild roasty maltiness along with some biscuit malts.

Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the 2007 GTMW: Pours an opaque black with a full, airy frothy tan head. Lightly sweet milk chocolate aroma has some nice oaky bourbon notes. Body starts with a mild earthy dark malty sweetness, a hint of light fruity tartness and vanilla oaky bourbon toward a smooth, dark chocolatey finish. A pretty interesting and enjoyable beer.
Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;tap at FoBAB 07. smells like gin and chalk. yuck! a bit thin. i like it insofar as it’s what ive been looking for in a raspberry RIS, but it doesn’t fully make it.... i didn’t realize while drinking or rating it’s meant to be a milk/sweet stout. so i’ll give it back a couple points on palate/overall.
Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;FoBAB 2007: As good as the FS 10 was this was just another in a line of disappointing beers. So much so I apologized to Andrew at the fest for my ratings. Pitch black with a minimal head or lace. Oh no, the dreaded green apple (Acetaldehyde flaw) appears on the nose. I found some fig, chocolate, herbal and grassy notes too. While I found no raspberry in the aroma there was a nice twang on the palate with a layer of sweet chocolate and vanilla beans in support. The finish is a tad boozy and oaky. The mouth feel is sticky but thin, aggressive and warming. Just could not get into this but would like to see if it improves in the future.
Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Had it at the Goose Island Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beer. Good raspberry flavor, but the beer didn’t seem as a hearty of a Stout as I would have liked. I think it could have been a lot heavier, but very good anyway.
Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap @ the Station for Andrews Bachelor Party. Well I’m not the 11th rating, but at least I’ll get it some percentile points. Pours red with a black beige head. Aroma of sour cherries, raspberry, oak, chocolate, and roast. Flavors are chocolate, red fruit, bourbon, and dark chocolate. Balanced really well with a choclate/charred lightly sweet but dry finish. Mmm. Well done.
Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;GTMW. Flossmoor Station’s beers seem to be underrated almost across the board. Not sure why that’s the case -- they were my favorite tent at the festival. This was one of my last beers of the day, and it was another great stout with fruit added. I enjoyed the bourbon barrel Cherry Stout from Bells just a bit more than this one, but this is an excellent fruit stout as well. It reminded me a bit of blending Dark Lord with New Glarus’ Raspberry beer. Onto the beer, thick, oily, viscous, with notes of dark chocolate and framboise wine. I actually thought my wife might like it given the sweetness, but there was too much stout for her here. Vanilla, soy, raisin, cream and a touch of bourbon on the palate. Well extracted, and well crafted in general. Must be more than 5.5 ABV?!?
Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at GTMW. Poured a deep, garnet-tinted brown with a short cap of deep brown head. Aroma picked up toasty semi-sweet chocolates along with sour fruit.. couldn’t place the fruit.. smelled nice. Flavor was of very well-roasted sweeter chocolates with sour raspberries and very mild vanilla and bourbon presence (didn’t realize this was BA when I got it).. rather simple, but certainly tasty! Creamy on the palate but yields to oak and berry sourness a bit abruptly.. odd sour/sweet contrast on the finish.
Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;on tap. pours black with tan head. nose of cherries, roasty. flavor is roasty, tart cherries and raspberries, and vanilla. a very nice stout but i’d like it served in an imperial pint glass not this snifter. it’d also work better as a bigger beer not a milk stout of 5.5%abv.
Flossmoor Station 11;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pitch black with brown head. Aroma of rasberries, choclate, and light bourbon. Flavor of rasberries, light sweet, cherry, alc, with a light bourbon taste that compliments it very well. Body is full with creamyness. Very good and one of those beers I could drink all the time.

Pleasant on a hot summer afternoon."
Pictish Siren;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Wheat Ale;Pictish Brewing;Peoples History Museum Beer Festival 2016. Bright clear blonde coloured. Hoppy, slightly floral, with a lingering malty-bitterness. There’s some wheat beer character here, but it’s mainly an average ale.

Pictish Siren;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Wheat Ale;Pictish Brewing;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. Very pale gold with slight haze, lasting white head. I keep trying Pictish beers as Gazza says they’re great. Faint hop aroma, ok in mouth. Finish is sherberty hoppy with a little of the yeast from teh aroma coming through. It’s not wonderful.
Pictish Siren;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Wheat Ale;Pictish Brewing;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 06-07-07. This poured amazingly clear and a very pale golden colour I was rather suprised, I was expecting at the very least some haziness to it. Once people clocked onto this beer it actually went down very well indeed and I could see why. It had a nice if maybe too subtle aroma with a hint of orange and wheat, the taste was very clean and really refreshing, some spiciness and wheat but quite delicate, still a very nice beer.
Pictish Siren;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Wheat Ale;Pictish Brewing;Gravity, Merton Beer Festival. Luminous yellow gold, delicate white head. Full sulfur and orange marmalade aroma. A clean smell--something you’d expect in a bar of fancified soap. Delicate hop flavor, mineral. Very light reminder of the wheat content. Not bad at all. A beer that has something alive about it.
Pictish Siren;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Wheat Ale;Pictish Brewing;CasK Merton Summer Festival. Especially loved by ER, cask wheat beer with strong wheat flavours and hints of coriander? Another excellent beer at Merton.

Downton Happy Hopi;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Guide Dog, Soton.

Downton Happy Hopi;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 05-07-07 Had a little snifter of this on the Thursday it had settled very well. Poured a mid brown colour with small white head. Whilst there there was a definite hoppiness to this it wasn’t quite as pronounced as I had anticipated. I enjoyed this beers simplicity there was a nice soft toffeeness to it and the hops gave it a reasonable bitterness a good easy drinking beer that I would happily have a session on but how I wish I’d have got the Chimera IPA a stunning beer in my opinion.
Downton Happy Hopi;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Downton Brewery;Cask conditioned at Merton Beer Festival ’07. Chestnut colour with slight head. Darkly roasted malty beer despite the hint at hops in the name, some toffee notes and and a little vanilla. There are hops on the finish, giving a twangy dryness, its a reasonable beer.

Digfield Mad Monk;Barnwell, Northamptonshire, England;Porter;Digfield Ales;Cask conditioned at Merton Beer Festival ’07. Clouded brown with no head. This was the only beer at the Festival not to truly settle out, no mean feat at a summer festival. Dark and malty with a fruity nose and body, lost some of it because some kids roped me in to playing Football, but had enough to rate.
Rebellion Defector;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;"Cask at the Monks Retreat (JDW), Reading. Cehstnut body with a beige head; fruity aroma; fruity in the mouth to start with, then developing roasted malts, quite sweet and nutty; with a drying finish. Quite complex and interesting."

Rebellion Defector;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;Cask at Merton Summer Beer Festival 07-07-07. Poured reddy amber and was very much a standard fruity malty bitter, I’m not so sure you need to re-rate this Glen as I think you may be a little bit disappointed if you went back to it again, it did very little for me at all.
Rebellion Defector;Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rebellion Beer Co.;"Cask conditioned at Merton Beer Festival ’07; Brown red with slight head. Definitely a fruity malty beer but with enough body and finish to cope, I’ve noticed a recent trend towards darker bitters recently, thats ok by me. I admit to being tired by now so I will re rate this when i can, the missus was also giving me a hard time for something, the notes were accordingly sketchy."

With warmth, the nose releases pungent scents of fish oil and graham crackers, dropping the aroma and overall score another point. This beer is average at best.
Front Street Coffee Stout;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Stout;Front Street Brewery (NC);Growler. Courtesy Dragonstout. Pours dark brown/black with very little head. Aroma is hardcore coffee. Really hardcore coffee. By far the most coffee I’ve ever smelled in a beer. There is some chocolate underneath, which is the only thing that distinguishes the aroma from being identical to actual coffee. Taste is, surprise, coffee. A roasty finish. A bit thin-bodied, to a fault. This is unsubtle and over the top but I love coffee so this did me well. This would be a nice pint to start the day off...

East End Smokestack Heritage Porter;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Porter - Smoked;East End Brewing Company;Pint at the brewery. Cola colored body with a small khaki head. Good meaty smoke in the nose and it's reasonably hoppy and sharp. The palate is a little thin for a porter, but the smoke flavor is solid. Some espresso notes in there.

Low retention on the beige head. Lightly smokey nose shows salt, black pepper, soy garlic bbq. Hmmmm, the roast is bacony but still not too heavy. Not very smokey in the mouth.

Rock Bottom Bethesda Right on Rye;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rock Bottom Bethesda;"Draft as ""Right on Rye PA"" on 07/04/15. The menu said 6.2% ABV. Arrived at the table a clear amber with a thin beige head. The aroma featured lots of rye, pine, zesty citrus rinds, grapefruits, and just a bit of a caramel backbone. Went down medium-bodied. A rich, rye bready quality started things off taste-wise. The finish featured plenty of grapefruits and zesty citrus rinds. This was spicy throughout. Tasty."
Rock Bottom Bethesda Right on Rye;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rock Bottom Bethesda;On cask at Rock Bottom in Bethesda, MD.

Aroma of rye toast, caramel, spice, bread and floral hops. Taste of brown bread, rye toast, spice, caramel/toffee malt and touch of floral hops. Medium body and low (cask) carbonization with a nice silky mouthfeel.

Labeled 5.4%. pours a dense amber color with a slight white head and lace. Medium body. Nice mouthfeel with subtle hop flavor and rich maltiness. Nice rye comexity and dry finish.

Rock Bottom Bethesda Right on Rye;Bethesda, Maryland, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Rock Bottom Bethesda;Draft: Pours a very standard look and feel. The aroma wasn’t anything too major and the taste followed suit. A very mild and unoffensive beer all around. The flavors were mainly grassy, but not much else really shined through.
Short's Grass River Natural Ale;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Short's Brewing Company;GABF 2007. Solid, but not spectacular, and pales in comparison to the other offerings at their booth. Grassy through and through, from the smell to the taste to the feel to the finish. Very clean bitter hops in the finish, not much citric quality, staying true to the British ideal I guess. Some menthol-ish mint in the finish as well which is kind of distracting. Not at all fruity. Like every Shorts beer I’ve had, a flavor experiment that you either like or don’t, which I respect.
Short's Grass River Natural Ale;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Short's Brewing Company;Bottle poured a lightly hazy copper with a lasting white head. Aromas of carmel, earthiness and light citrus. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of bread, carmel, earthiness and a hint of orange with a crisp lightly bitter finish.
Short's Grass River Natural Ale;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Short's Brewing Company;12 Oz Bottle. Aroma is a nice tangy, hop resin and spiced rum aroma. Light alcohols carry a very old world hop scent to the nose. Bits of Styrofoam mingle. Pours a hazed peach golden with rim of soapy white, rocky on the way down. Flavor rings with some bitter hop Styrofoam again, I’m pretty certain this is derived from one of the hop varieties, but a whole mouth of chewy candied orange and caramel malt brings earthly delight. Explosive and granular. Texture is right on for the style. There’s some fun musty spice, speaking of Indian Curry and Caribbean pickling. A nice beer and a wonderful rendition of the particular style. Thanks Sean!
Short's Grass River Natural Ale;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Short's Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle courtesy of Xav33- thanks X! Pours a hazy straw colour with very good head retention. Aroma’s of sweet fruit in the nose. Taste- very nice hop bite at first sip, juicy and aromatic. Malts- cereal and grainy. Blends well with the juicy hops. The grassy and woody side of the hops take over at the finish. I can’t exactly place the hops- given its an english IPA, I’ll presume mostly english. If so, there was more pine and citrus than I would have expected. This is a good quaffer, refreshing and carbonation levels are spot on. I never even noticed that it was an organic offering - a great organic beer for those interested in all things organic. A good brew for a hot and sticky summer day.
Short's Grass River Natural Ale;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Ale - English;Short's Brewing Company;Shorts Grass River Natural Ale 12 oz bottle. Recent brewing, enjoyed 07/07. Moderate pour in a tulip glass. Poured a hazy amber with a moderate fizzy mostly diminishing white head. Smelt of moderate fresh hops, mostly spruce and its resin, and a light to moderate sweet bread and pineapple. Taste was upfront strong bitter spruce and bittersweet pineapple and light to moderate honey and sweet bread followed by a strong bitter spruce and resin taste and a light sweet honey, gelatin and bread taste on a long buzzing green hops finish. Palate was light to medium bodied, slightly oily, lively carbonated and moderately astringent and numbing from the hops. Overall, this is a very good English style IPA. Tastes like fresh hops. It feels like a fresh undiscovered forest. Great stuff!
Kingstone Millers Ale;Chepstow, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kingstone Brewery;BCA from Bitter Virtue. Sweet malts with caramel but there is also good citric hops and a balancing bitterness. Not bad.
Kingstone Millers Ale;Chepstow, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kingstone Brewery;Bottle conditioned. Slightly cloudy, deep gold colour with slight off-white head.

Kingstone Millers Ale;Chepstow, Wales;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Kingstone Brewery;From bottle. A rich aroma, hint of fruit somewhere. not a very impressive appearance, in fact a little disappointing. No head and a quite depressing feel to it. Rich flavour of fruit and hops. Smooth on the palette. Not exciting and dull. Kingstone can do a lot better than this.

Slight stickiness on the palate. Nicely bitter, not very sweet, so you wouldn’t know the percentage. Hoppy. Main tastes are oranges and lemons. Very good stuff.
Alehouse I Dont Want To Talk 'bout It;St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Verulam Brewery;Cask-conditioned at the Lower Red Lion, St Albans 7/7/07. Pale gold with a decent white head which left plenty of lacing. Powerful hoppy aroma of grapefruit and pine. In the mouth this held its alcohol well with powerful hop flavours and a very long, dry finish. Excellent.
Alehouse I Dont Want To Talk 'bout It;St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Verulam Brewery;Cask handpull at Lower Red Lion, St Albans. I think this was brewed fro a local drinker’s 60th birthday. Gold, lasting white head. Again, top quality grapefruit hop aroma. Reasonably thick in mouth, but never syrupy, great condition and then this spritzy hop finish is tongue tingling. Pretty damn good. Rich strawberry fruit. Carries strength well. Strawberry jam develops to a pippy strawberry/grapefruit finish.
Alehouse Once Upon a Time in Mexico;St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Verulam Brewery;Cask handpull at Farmer’s Boy, St Albans. Brewed especially for the Mexico day at the pub. Pale gold, lasting thin white head. Smells of JHB/Dark Star Hophead brewed with jalapeno peppers. Tastes that way too. Base beer is good. Spiciness is pretty strong, but actually not disgusting.
G.G. Brewers Naughty Boy Stout;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;G.G. Brewers;Best beer Gerry had on tap that night for the masses. Deep black lil head and a good roast and slight carmel follows through to the pallet.....awsome stuff
G.G. Brewers Naughty Boy Stout;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;G.G. Brewers;Decent offering from our local brew master, the Naughty Boy is his most popular brew and by far his best showing. Deep roast, slight hop aroma, and chocolaty body are accented by a hint of spice. Well balanced, and highly drinkable. Finishes clean and slightly sweet.
G.G. Brewers Naughty Boy Stout;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;G.G. Brewers;On Cask. Poured a dark velvety black with a light cocoa head that did not last long. Aroma was predominantly chocolatey and sweet maltiness, lactose I was told, caramel and slightly coffee. Flavor was chocolate and roast, slightly coffee, with a hint of cinnamon biting at the end. Body was full and slighlty viscous but lacked any serious carbonation due to cask conditioning. From previous reviews I would assume this is not the same naughty boy but an improved version. The best offering so far. I would go back for seconds.
G.G. Brewers Naughty Boy Stout;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;G.G. Brewers;Muddy black body with a sudsy tan head. Aroma of cocoa, roast and weak coffee. Medium-high sugary sweetness in the flavor with prominent roast and light bitterness. Starchy texture. Most drinkable offering from G.G. on both my visits, but lacks the depth of malt that can really make an oatmeal stout stand out.
G.G. Brewers Naughty Boy Stout;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;G.G. Brewers;Draft at the brewpub. Cola body with a decent tan head. Roasty chocolate and malt nose. Mildly bitter chocolate and weak coffee flavors, a mild fruit note. OK.

ABK Fendt Vario-Weizen;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;Hazy amber/brown with a lot of bubbles. The head dilapidates quickly until it disappears entirely - quite outstanding for a Weizen. Not much aroma. Taste is centered around grainy flavours but not very intense before the gently bitter palate sets in. Drinkable, but not among the best of its peers.
ABK Fendt Vario-Weizen;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;Cloudy dark golden pour with a fine thick head. Nice lacing. Moderate intensity in the aroma.

ABK Fendt Vario-Weizen;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;Bottle, 5.2%. Quite citric aroma, lemony and slightly farty. Hazy dark golden colour. Small stable whitish head. The flavour starts off sweetish, turns papery and citric. Has a little clove. Smells strangely citric, almost infected, but does not taste as infected. Tastes a bit papery-old, though, but it is not past BB date at all. Decent mouthfeel.
ABK Fendt Vario-Weizen;Kaufbeuren, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren;Bottle. Pours hazy amber with stable off-white head. Clear aroma of malt, banana and caramel, with estery touches. Sourish, grainy flavour with notes of banana and sweetish touches of yeast, malt and caramel. Acidic and estery aftertaste. I am not sure it it is slightly off but it is drinkable, nonetheless.

Johansson's Black Hand Stout;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Stout;Johansson's Dining House;Black body with a small tan head. The nose is chocolate, roast, coffee and light brown sugar. The flavor is lightly sweet with chocolate, molasses and roast. Medium body is round with light carbonation.
Johansson's Black Hand Stout;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Stout;Johansson's Dining House;Cask pint at the brewery, had along with a plate-full of their 25 cent oysters. Damn that was good. The stout was dark black with mocha colored head. Flavor instantly hits you with liquid smoke and some soy sauce, but in a pretty good way, not offensive. Bitter chocolate and a little hint of bourbon and wood, with a flat, vinuous texture from the cask, it’s actually really good, especially with oysters. Meaty steak marinade and soy sauce, there’s a little hint of that in the back, not overpowering or gross at all, quite good. A different beer, certainly delicious in the right setting.
Johansson's Son of a Peach;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Johansson's Dining House;Had on draft at Bully’s in SC Barefoot Landing at Myrtle. I really really enjoyed this. Great appearance, hazy, nice lacing. Very soft , thick mouthfeel. Peach is understated. Tastes like some wheat is in there, complex body , a bit of hoppiness. This is not your wife’s fruity beer.
Johansson's Son of a Peach;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Johansson's Dining House;Draft pint at the brewery. Pale, watery, thin, oily even. Low carbonation but smooth. Some flavors of wet grains and sweet celery and weird, wet, moldy corn. Really not a good beer overall, but does have some decent banana yeast esters in the nose. Very simple. The thin and watery body is the worst part. Earlier Rating: 7/9/2007 Total Score: 3.3 Draft at the brewery. A very strange beer, couldn’t figure out if they were trying for an intentionally sour beer, or a berliner weisse or something similar. - now I hear it’s supposed to be a saison. Having had the Dogfish Head Festina Peche just one day prior, it struck me as a little close, but not exactly a clone. Clear yellow and pinkish color, with a still body and a little white head. Strange boozy, liquer peach nose, more candy smelled than fruit actually, but still decent. Tastes very unique, and confusing, with some biting acidity but not like a sour ale or berliner weisse... boozy peach syrup and wheat flavors round this out. I’m not sure what to think of it, but I’m glad it wasn’t a candy sweet fruit beer.
Market Cross Bessis Brown Ale;Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Market Cross Pub and Brewery;Draft at brewpub. Pours brown with a thin khaki head. Not much on the nose. Slight nuttiness on the tongue with a fair amount of caramel maltiness. Finish is clean. Eh!

Market Cross Bessis Brown Ale;Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Market Cross Pub and Brewery;Pours a dark brown with a nice off white head. Aroma of toasted nuts, malty. Watery mouthfeel gives way to a nutty body. Not very sweet, or complex, but a nice beer nonetheless.
Market Cross Bessis Brown Ale;Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Market Cross Pub and Brewery;Brown in color with a small head. Fairly unremarkable beer: thin bodied, light malty nut flavor. Not much to say about this one.

Market Cross Bessis Brown Ale;Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Market Cross Pub and Brewery;Draught at the brewpub. Pours, well, brown with minimal head. The aroma is sweet caramel with a little bit of grain and grass. The flavor is the same: caramel, some hay, slight woodiness in finish. A little bland, but ok.
Market Cross Bessis Brown Ale;Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Market Cross Pub and Brewery;cask pint at the brewpub: aroma was faint with hints of wood, and malt. came off the hand pump with a lucious creamy head, and brillant brown color. Flavor was very much live a mild, minus no chocolately, coffee notes. lots of nice sweet, carmally, toffeeish maltiness, and the classic fruitiness of an english ale. As the drink goes down the fruitiness becomes the dominant flavor. A subtle but very delicious and satisfying drink. palate was creamy and classic for a cask ale. Makes me miss England.
Market Cross Bessis Brown Ale;Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Market Cross Pub and Brewery;Cask pint at the brewery. Lightly murky with a brown colored body and a tan, creamy cask head. Mild flavor overall, very mild, but good and without defects. Very faint nose of mild wood and wheat, flavor is similar, some light husk, light grains, light maple flavors. Reminds me of mild ale on cask, actually.
The Covey Chupecabra;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Dubbel;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;Had on tap 8/30/07 at the restaurant. Poured into cold glass-damn. No head and color is light brown and cleanish. Nose is light and refreshing. Very malty/roasty on the palate. Alcohol is well hidden. As is warms the palate gets thicker and creamier, allowing the malts to come through nicely. A well done if pedestrian effort for a dubbel. Note: I was in here around 7pm on a weekday and it was dead. Great menu if not a bit pricey. Hope they can make it last.
The Covey Chupecabra;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Dubbel;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;Rating from memory. Pours a dirty orange-brown with a tan head. Aroma is roasty, but there’s some funky yeasty and vaguely mushroom qualities. Tastes of roast, bread, with just the slightest bit of rotten fruit and cloves to keep things pretty funky. Roast carries through to the finish as well, and it’s fairly dry. If this is what the abbey was intended to taste like, then man, did that one miss the mark! To me, this was more like an amped up 1554. Just a bit more yeast characteristics, and a more interesting roasted malt profile. If this and the IPA are where the Covey is headed, then the beer is doing well! Unfortunately the restuarant was dead 2 hours until closing. Good beer.
The Covey Chupecabra;Fort Worth, Texas, United States;Dubbel;The Covey Restaurant & Brewery;"Flavor profile is close to a Chimay Red but with too much roasty malt dominating the flavor profile. Not bad but not too ""dubbely."" Taste doesn’t live up to its rather unusual and spectacular name."

Soft sour wine and raspberry notes in an unremarkable caramel mild base. Paint remover, varnish, soap powder and old socks. This is hovering between the bottom end of the standard small brewery milds and the regional breweries’ 3th wash and caramel stained milds.

Nelson Master Mate;Chatham, Kent, England;Mild Ale;Nelson Brewing Co.;A Sim rate (cask at the Wenlock): Sweet aroma of musty grandparents’ homes, but in a good way. It’s a mixture of endearing veg (like cabbage), slightly dusty mantles and dogs recently bathed with the garden hose and now drying slightly in the drifting summer sun. It’s the wood from the sturdy front door and the asbestos-ridden paint job. Comforting, if not very good for you. Taste is distinctly nuttily mild. Nice. I enjoyed it.

Midnight Sun Obliteration I;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Big thanks to BrianK! 2007 though so past its priime no doubt- still it smelled and tasted ok. Pours a a medium orange with some haze and a nice sticky head. Aroma is slightly old greenish hops, oily, with some dank old resin, and a bit of paper ox overlays the dull toffee and crackery, caramel malts. Flavor is cold smoke harsh resin- chinook like- green and tea like, some citrus, and grapefruit but a bit old. Green and sligthly tacky bitterness with hints of astringency. Still holding up ok despite its age.
Midnight Sun Obliteration I;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Huge thanks to BrianK. Poured a slightly hazed copper color with a thin off-white head. Sweet malt aroma with some notes of age to it. Citrus hops still show through. Nice citrus flavor. Dry malt with a stiff bitterness. Very long hop bitterness for the finish. Medium bodied. This held up quite well.
Midnight Sun Obliteration I;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;This one was dry, slightly sweet and still hoppy. Not bad for it’s age. While the dryhops are on their way downhill, there’s still plenty of bittering hops left to still give it some kick. Still enjoyable. Let this one warm a bit to still get the hop profile.

The beer pours to a glowing amber body with a creamy white head. Awesome lacing. The aroma is a really exotic hop combination. Pine and grapefruit meets pineapple, grasses, and herbs, with some other citrus. The flavor is hoppy with grasses in the forefront with strong weeds/herbs. Pine and grapefruit secondarily. The palate is bitter, hoppy, and medium bodied. Not overly hopped and chalky like it could be...
Midnight Sun Obliteration I;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Thanks to Tim for the bomber! Poured a sparkling, brighter golden with a short cap of white head. The aroma picked up spicy Amarillo upfront with large doses of pine, floral, and grapefruit not far behind.. toasty orange zest, and deeper toffee notes backing it up.. extremely well balanced, and worked the hops and malt into the nose. The flavor picked up toasty toffee at the core with some fruity malts.. a whole bunch of hoppage joined in at the edges.. grapefruit, pineapple, cat pee, orange zest, and spicy hops blend well together on the hop front, giving a substantial presence on the edges and through the finish. Medium-plus bodied, spicy, and well-balanced on the palate with a heavy hop bitter impression on the finish. This was great!
Midnight Sun Obliteration I;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Tasted at Conspiracy tasting at Horse Brass pub 2007--Big fruity nose and powerfully grapefruit-esque.

Exceptional IPA!
Midnight Sun Obliteration I;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Bottle shared by cquiroga: Pours a clear orange bronze with a thin, clingy-lacing froth of white head. Aroma of slightly musty earthy piny hops along with mild caramel malt and some oranges. Starts with a good caramel and pale malty sweetness, balanced with a big bittering citrus hoppiness toward a drier, grassy bitter finish. A pretty good double IPA, but could use a little more malty balance.
Midnight Sun Obliteration I;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Midnight Sun Brewing Company;Pours clear and copper, with a white, thin head. A short-lived, full skim coat of foam dissapated to partial coverage, and some strings of lacework become apparent after each sip. Aromatics are pungently tropical and grassy. Wet spruce with zests of orange and grapefruit. This combination of hops is more assertive and pungent and less floral and delicate. Mouthfeel is crisp and drying, with carbonation somewhat on the light side. The pallet is assertively bitter, for sure. Plenty of citrus bite, laden with grapefruit pith, bitter orange peel, and lemon oil. Malt is very light and alcohol is warming but not hot. The bitterness is non-compromising and lingering, and the peppery, zingy, hop-bite rides well on top. Finishes warming with a lingering, drying bitterness and aggressive hop flavors. A big, bad Alaskan hop monster from a brewery that knows how to make great DIPA’s
The Twisted Hop Plum Duff;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;The Twisted Hop;I tried this beer about a year after it had ben brewed and I was disappointed but understanding as to why it hadn’t aged well. I wish it had to be honest. My palate was too young to appreciate it when it was at its best off tap.
The Twisted Hop Plum Duff;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;The Twisted Hop;"Tasted late October 2007. 500ml bottle, shared with the ""team"" on our Chch brewery trip. Dark, lowly carbonated, little length on the head. Roasty and plummy (funnily enough) on the nose. Very toasty, tending roasty, in the mouth with a great plum sourness and tannic bite. Lingering. A couple of us had a fantastic tour of the facilities and then pulled out a great little selection of experimental specials. This was one of them and was my second favourite, after the fantastic brett-centric Raspbiery Lambic. I’d like to see more of both."
The Twisted Hop Plum Duff;Christchurch, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;The Twisted Hop;More a fruit stout than a fruit beer. Lucky last firkin, well aged! Black, guiness like in the glass. Sweet yet tart. Intreguing almost lambic like sourness.
Tommyknocker E.S.B.;Idaho Springs, Colorado, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Tommyknocker Brewery;At brewery Idaho Springs. Bought growler. Pours a cloudy golden color with a small but frothy head. Aroma of cascade citrus and floralness. Starts sweet with malty light caramel and moves quickley to the citrus character of the aroma, only to finish malty and dry. seems more like an APA than ESB... a surprise find.
The Beer Joint Head Knocker;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;Draft. Pours a hazy orange with a tint of brown and a small, foamy head. Unusual nose. Orange, ripe fruit, and even a hint of vomit. Medium-low carbonation with a medium-rich mouthfeel. Overripe boozy fruit, alcohol, and a slight bitter backdrop. Finish is short and surprisingly clean. This one is odd and not entirely appealing. I have had it a few times over the past month and it doesn’t seem to be aging well.
The Beer Joint Head Knocker;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;"Sampled at Vintage 50. At the brewery, this is labled an ""English-style golden barleywine"". Pours a somewhat hazy, attractive light copper with a white head. Earthy Brit hops with a touch of light berries in the nose - very subtle aroma. Flavor has notes of light caramel, wood, honey, cherry and more of that interesting berry character. Firm hop bitterness but it still retains plenty of malty sweetness. Medium bodied, not thin but not barleywine viscosity either. Moderate carbonation. Interesting beer, enjoyable overall."
The Beer Joint Head Knocker;Leesburg, Virginia, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Beer Joint / Vintage 50;5oz glass at the brewery. Slightly cloudy yellow and gold color, 10-20% opaque, resembles a Belgian golden ale or tripel. This is a complicated beer. I wasn’t exactly sure what it was... is this a Belgian style? It kind of tastes and smells like it, with some sharp fruit and sour yeast in the nose, a lot of unfermentables, a lot of sugar in the nose, and then when warmer some sour vegetal notes. Spritzy on the palate but heavy, sticky and thick, and I would guess around 7.5-8% but I’m told it’s around 5%. Assertive hops hit you in the finish, not grassy or leafy or fruity, just bitter and sticky sweet, with the finish mainly tasting like Belgian candy sugar. Weird beer.
Full Sail Son of Peter DIPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;"On tap at Lucky Baldwin’s IPA Festival ’07. Medium amber-gold color with a loose head. Very light hops aroma with some lager-like characteristics, light banana and caramel. Light fruit and malt notes in the flavor--nothing too distinctive here. Light malt body with some bitterness in the mouthfeel doesn’t leave a lasting impression. One of the most unexcitind ""double"" IPAs I’ve had."
Full Sail Son of Peter DIPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;[b]draft @ lucky baldwins IPA fest[/b] - amber colored with a creamy head. definitely a PNW style IPA/IIPA. lots of grapefruity hops with a slightly sweet malt background. solid but at the same time kinda run of the mill IPA. nothing extrordinary, but very drinkable
Full Sail Son of Peter DIPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;"Sampled at Lucky Baldwin’s IPA festival, June 2007 The beer is mostly clear, with a reddish hued, copper color. It is topped by a barely one-finger thick, light tan colored creamed froth for a head. The smell is quite sweet and fruity; notes of tropical fruit, candied orange peel, melon, lychee, tangelo, mandarin orange syrup all jump from the glass and are even noticeable as it just sits in wait on the table in front of me. The flavor is not nearly as sweet as the aroma suggests, but that exotic, smooth fruitiness still plays a big role in the flavor. Actually, this beer is very light bodied, even for a west coast DIPA. A nice, bracing bitterness runs throughout the beer and it becomes increasingly bitter and even a bit astringent even after the beer has left my mouth. Underneath the hop onslaught there is a dry, fresh ground, malt character that is sort of biscuit-like with some soda-cracker notes noticeable, but only at times. Otherwise this beer is purely hop driven, there is even some menthol and even mint-like flavors from the hops too. This has a very tropical fruit driven hop character and it is very drinkable. It is quite interesting and I am not quite sure what to think of its über-fruitiness, bit I do like it in the end. Actually some more malt and even a touch more body would amplify the hop character a bit to make this even more over the top."
Town Hall Hamlets Curse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;4 or 5 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 6-20-15. Pours a very nice maroon with an amber hue. Beige head. Looks good. Plum, caramel, and raspberry scents. Fruity flavor matches the fruity aroma. Malty taste. Medium to full body.

Pours a clear deep amber with a very thin tan head that dissipates completely. Aroma has lots of bread and grain notes with a touch of underlying toffee. Flavor has sweet grains and toffee with a bit of caramel and a hint of bread.
Town Hall Hamlets Curse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler, courtesy dchmela. Pours a mostly clear, dark reddish amber color and topped by a small, smooth head of beige colored foam that settles to a thin film and leaving random spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is based in sweet caramel, brown sugar, and bready malts to go along with some dark fruits, spices, and some vanilla to smooth things out. The flavor follows suit with the bready malts, dark fruits, caramel, and some balancing earthen hop bitterness. The alcohol comes through a bit on the finish as well. Medium bodied, smooth, with moderate carbonation and a sweet finish with some alcohol warmth. Fairly straight forward, but solid brew either way.
Town Hall Hamlets Curse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler. Clear and dark, sporting a reddish-amber hue, the body sports a small, smooth cap of beige foam. Moderate lacing is primarily spotty in nature. Aromas start out with caramelized brown sugars and sweet bread crust malts, hinting also at stewed raisins and a little winter spice. Vanilla makes an appearance, and some mild, earthen hops do well to keep things somewhat in balance. Flavors largely follow suit, again very bready and malty, laden with caramelized sugars, dark bread, and some sugary dark fruits, all with a earthy hop counterpoint and some noticeable alcohol. Substantial in body and smooth, with moderate carbonation, the palate shows some boozy warmth and a sweet finish, but doesn’t get to be overly hot or cloying. Overall, it’s a solid brew. Maybe a little mundane, but well made nonetheless.
Town Hall Hamlets Curse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - English;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Growler pour. Deep red pour with a thick off white head.

Diamond Knot Shipwreck XXX IPA;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Diamond Knot Brewery;Draught in a flight at the brewpub. I was a bit disappointed, unfortunately. The beer was grassy and seemed a bit stale, and just wasn’t inviting. It was drinkable, but lacked those nice floral and citrus notes I want in an IPA.
Diamond Knot Shipwreck XXX IPA;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Diamond Knot Brewery;"Tap at the brewpub. Pours slightly ruddy copper with a large beige head. Aroma is moderately dark/sweet malt with mixed hop. Flavor is malty, with mixed hop and some definite wood notes. Sort of a roasty barley wine; sort of a malty DIPA. Not a trace of heat for me. Went down quite a treat. A little bit warming. There’s enough bitter to nicely balance the malt."

Triangle Belgian-Style Strong Golden Ale;Durham, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Triangle Brewing Company;My can does not say strong on it, just 8%. Looks a little like an orangish hefe. Mild aroma goes boozy on the tongue once liquid is taken. Coarse, ruff, undisciplined. Leaves an impression. Everything was fine till I tasted it, raw, no civility. Feels like 12%. Even barleywine immature in effect at times. Want to catch a buzz and know that you did it? Probably more like an American strong ale wannah bee.
Triangle Belgian-Style Strong Golden Ale;Durham, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Triangle Brewing Company;"Overall this great Golden is a fantastic creation : but definitely not good for sessions. Found it to be have fairly sweet qualities, with little to no aftertaste, highly alcoholic in character, but not in taste, and aesthetically beautiful with its dark (slightly cloudy) hue. Full-bodied and hardly bitter, the toughest part of this beer is getting it out of the 6-pack retainer; otherwise, it’s a real pleasure but definitely should be enjoyed only in moderation (too many of these can be overpowering in taste and daze)."
Triangle Belgian-Style Strong Golden Ale;Durham, North Carolina, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Triangle Brewing Company;Pours golden, cloudy, average head.

Absolutely lovely beer, deep garnet pour with a very attractive and cloudy head. Soft, fruity yeasty notes in the nose with some sticky malts too.

Zero Gravity Bufflehead Saison;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Draft at Blackback. Interesting beer thats a bit to clean for my tastes in saisons. The Citra adds a nice fresh citrus/dankness to the beer but the base saison is a little watery and bland. Still nice and drinkable.

Wheaty, floral, some farmhouse character and light brett. Kind of lactic, kind of sweetish, with bitter noble hops flavor and some spritzy cheap grapefruit juice. Not especially exciting.

Zero Gravity Bufflehead Saison;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Pale golden beer.

G.G. Brewers Amberly Eyes;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;G.G. Brewers;Amber body with a finger of off-white head. Just the right amount of carbonation, a sweet malty nose, mildly hoppy. The flavor is smoothly malty and surprisingly citrusy considering its not that bitter, and the hops make an appearance at the end but its not overwhelming and not bitter. It could use some more hops to cover the alcohol finish in the end.

Moat Mountain Czech Style Pilsner Lager;North Conway, New Hampshire, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Moat Mountain Smoke House & Brewing Company;On tap @ Moat Mountain. Clear golden beer with a white head. Much like their Helles, this is a pretty innocuous pale lager. Not much in the way of hop character and just some sweet bready malts. Maybe a little bit less ester character and a touch of bitterness on the very back end. Okay beer.

G.G. Brewers Classic Light;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;G.G. Brewers;Clear, pale straw body with light carbonation and a clean, filmy white head. Mild aroma of melon, corn, and green apple. Flavor is bland with light sweetness and minimal balancing bitterness and undeveloped yeast characters. Light-bodied, of course. A palate cleanser, but somewhat off-putting even in that role. I guess the clientele requires this, which is unfortunate because this tap would be much better served by a more interesting and palatable offering. A carefully crafted kolsch would be nice to see in this spot instead.
G.G. Brewers Classic Light;Glenside, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;G.G. Brewers;Draft at the brewpub. I thought this was listed as Keswick Light. Anyway, straw with a white head. Light grain and floral, flavor is the same, very weak flavors. I guess everyone needs a BMC knockoff...

Banks's Mild / Original (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Cask at the Station Social Club. Light brown and clear with a tight creamy head. Caramel and malty aroma with some vegetal notes. Sweet taste with lots of earthy malt and a touch of sourness on the short finish. As expected there's not a lot to it but it's drinkable enough. Lots of better miles out there though.
Banks's Mild / Original (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Cask. Aroma modestly malty. Pours chestnut with thin lace top. Taste has caramelized malt and soft fruits. Watery with flat carbonation and a mild (yes, I know) bitter finish.

Caramel and malts. Light bodied. Watery. Light carbonation. Low key finish. Could down a load of these in that it’s so light and low key, could then forget what you were drinking straight away.
Banks's Mild / Original (Cask);Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Mild Ale;Banks's (Marston's);My Bottom Line: Crystallized sugars smother bitter hop leaves, as mineral dryness sees more cereal sweetness seal the finish. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy head of foam tops the shiny deep amber. -The body is nicely soft and full. -The finish isn’t too sweet even though the flavour profile focuses on the crystallized sugars. -This must be very appropriate with a Sunday roast and gravy. -This is cotton candy for adults. Not serious, but different and fun. On cask at The London, LLandudno.

Zero Gravity Mr. Black Schwarzbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;6 oz. pour @ the brew pub. Nose of light roasted malt and some lager yeast. Flavors of Chocolate malt and light smoke with the lager yeast noticeable again. Body is lighter which is NOT negative. Gives it added drinkability. Decent for the style. I would really like to have had a bit more chocolate and hop bitterness. This really could be much better if they refine the recipe.

Zero Gravity Mr. Black Schwarzbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;On tap at American Flatbread. Pours a deep brown to black with a medium sized beige head. Roast all over, a touch of plastic hiding behind it. A bit on the thin side, but with such a low ABV that’s probably to be expected.

Doughy and slightly strawy malty nose with shy grainy spots and a touch of herbal hops. Mildly bitter and slightly sweet flavour, light to medium bodied with a lively carbonation. Initially dry and strawy pale malt character with herbal and grassy hops gaining weight from the middle part, getting stronger towards the dry and moderately hop bitter finish.

Nice lacing on the glass. Notes of fruity aroma. Yeast and fruity tartness and a little tingle of hops coming through to the flavour. Not so sweet as many German Weissbier, buy maybe too much yeast to it. Quaffable, though (19.06.2007).
Herkimer Berliner Weisse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Very clear blonde colour with a fairly small head that was really just a coating on top. The aroma was kind of wheat with some lactic funk. It is very clean if that makes sense. Light on the palate and carbonation. The flavor is faint but it is there. There isn’t a whole lot in the begining but the tart flavors quickly come out. There is a sour candy like sweetness to this with a dry sour finish. It isn’t the best example of the style but I sure do applaud them dfor doing it.
Herkimer Berliner Weisse;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Berliner Weisse;Herkimer Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Poured into a chalice that must have weighed at least a pound.

Rich and creamy body with nice acidity and a decent amount of carbonation. Flavor was creamy, citrusy and acidic. Quite dry. Hints of granny smith apples with a bit of sweet malt. Very refreshing and thirst quenching. Sour, but not overly so. Kind of a lactose creamy sour. Finishes crisp and dry.

Taste is light to medium bodied, with flavors of white bread dough, flowery hops and a touch of pear. Finish is semi-sweet, flowery and a light malt aftertaste. Slightly little more metallic than the Taylor’s Crossing version but still enjoyable.

Dix Red Truck Lager;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Dix BBQ & Brewery;Sure, I’ll do the tick. Straw colour. Thin head. Lots of tiny bubbles. Light pale malt and grassy hop. Malt-accented, bouncing between doughiness and breadiness. Not much bitterness. Bland but clean. I can’t give a failing grade on execution, only on concept.

Klosterhof Öko Pilsener;Nürnberg, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Norma (Discounter);(bottle) Hazy, pale golden colour with a moderate Pilsener-blonde foamy head. Discreet aroma: slightly dusty and sweet grainy nose with hay and herbal hops. Bitter flavour, light to medium bodied with a medium carbonation. Soft malty taste with strong yeasty notes including a slightly harsh bitterness from the beginning, moderately dry, yeasty and bitter finish with slightly spicy and herbal hops accents. A bit unbalanced but drinkable Zwickel-Pils, produced for the discount-store chain Norma.
Bristol Beer Factory Old Smokey;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Smoked - Rauchbier;Bristol Beer Factory;Cask-conditioned at the Robin Hoods retreat, Bristol, 10/7/07. A special to mark the end of smoking in pubs. Amber coloured with a lacy, off-white head. Aroma was of hay and biscuit malt with the faintest whiff of smoke. In the mouth it started slightly sweet before the smokiness kicked in. This was a subtle flavour of smoked ham, like a subdued version of Spezial Rauchbier. A good English version of the style, but if BBF had been braver and adopted the style wholeheartedly, it could have been great.
5 Seasons North Espresso Black Hole Stout;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Stout;5 Seasons North;Pours black with thick beige head and good lacing throughout. Smell is coffee, roasted malts. Taste reveals a nice creamy sweetness to balance out the roast coffee and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is the best part. So suculant. Nice brew.
5 Seasons North Espresso Black Hole Stout;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Stout;5 Seasons North;Comes out of the tap an opaque coffee-brown sable with a nice tan head. Aroma is richly of quality roast coffee with a hint of unsweet chocolate. Fine coffee dominates the flavor, which has smoky and sweet hints and a touch of chocolate. Fizzy texture leaves a nice coffee-flavored tingle.

5 Seasons North Espresso Black Hole Stout;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Stout;5 Seasons North;On tap at the brewpub in Alpharetta. Dark, motor oil-like pour with a very thick mocha colored head. Strong coffee/espresso aroma with hints of dark chocolate. Flavor has the same elements as well - mixed in very well. almost like a liqueur in its viscosity and thickness. Espresso delight wiht an overload of chocolate. Kind of reminds me of a fudge sundae with an alcohol bite. Overall, excellent.
5 Seasons North Espresso Black Hole Stout;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Stout;5 Seasons North;I loved the Black Hole Stout, and this does the coffee right, even though the coffee flavors and aroma override the rest of the beer. None of the ashiness or harshness that some coffee beers pick up from the coffee beans are present, but all of that complex roasty aromas from that first cup of coffee are there. Great beer to pair with the creme brulee.
5 Seasons North Whisky Barrel Aged Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;5 Seasons North;750ml bottle. Pours extremely dark murky mahogany, almost black actually, with almost no carbonation visible at all. A few stray bubbles that recede immediately to nothing. The aroma is big and complex with whiskey and vanilla up front but then comes raisins, plums, molasses, leather and caramel. Little bit of wood coming through. The taste is even better and one of the better Belgians I’ve tasted. Initial wave is vanilla, oak and leather. But immediately following that is a much sweeter chocolate and dark fruit character. The sweetness then subsides to a dry, warming finish with whiskey and oak. Sublime taste. The mouthfeel, as with The Question, keeps this from being a world class brew. It’s just under carbonated, pure and simple. It’s not completely flat, but close and is enough to knock this down a notch. This beer has the potential to bee of the best beers I’ve ever had. The aroma and flavor are sublime but the carbonation detracts from the beer. I’m looking forward to trying this with proper carbonation and we’d be talking about an unbelievable beer.
5 Seasons North Whisky Barrel Aged Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;5 Seasons North;Pours dark brown-black with a faint head. Aroma initially of alcohol, with an underlying sweetness of brown sugar. Flavor is of caramel, chocolate and vanilla with an underlying alcohol burn.
5 Seasons North Whisky Barrel Aged Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;5 Seasons North;Thanks Naven and Jimbowood! A nondescript bottle led to one of the more delicious finds I’ve had in a while. Just outstanding in every way. Rich, thick and loaded with barrel aged flavor. The group of us universally agreed that this set the benchmark pretty high for future barrel aged beers. What an outstanding find.
5 Seasons North Whisky Barrel Aged Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;5 Seasons North;Bottle from my man Jimbo. Hand bottled by the brewer. Shared with a bunch of folks. This is a near perfect beer. Rich, smooth, wonderful. Vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar were the dominant flavors I detected. This is possibly the best example of barrel aging that I have tasted. We all agreed that this is very similar to the first batch of Angels share, and perhaps better. It’s that good. Even uber brewer Lee stated it’s the best beer he’s had in a long time. We all agreed. Very good.
5 Seasons North Whisky Barrel Aged Quinte55ence;Alpharetta, Georgia, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;5 Seasons North;Bottle acquired in trade.

Nickel Brook Draught;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;Had a mini pitcher at FarmTeam Cookhouse in Ottawa. Apparently, this one is called Barn Dog Ale at their establishment. Has a golden light amber appearance and has a nice foamy off white head. Pretty good lacing. Toffee and roasted malt aromas. Fairly bitter type of hops used, slightly rusty kind of taste. Drying and slick mouthfeel. Not too bad.
Nickel Brook Draught;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;341ml bottle. Super clear brew with little head and a yellow amber colour. Muted aroma but there is some cream of corn aroma and light apple with some floral hops and light malts. On the palate it is watery, sports a fast flavour profile and leaves nothing on the finish. Flavours are light bitterness and a hint of malted biscuit. Boring.
Nickel Brook Draught;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;"Bottle, at a wedding where the other choices were macro pale lagers. This was actually drinkable, for which I was thankful. Clear gold. Fruity nose. A little caramel malt in the taste, with a little fruitiness, and a bit of a bitter bite.

Nickel Brook Draught;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;Sweet easy drinking beer. Pretty basic as far as craft beer goes. They did admit this is their ’entry level’ offering, and it’s crisp enough to be enjoyable under the right circumstances.
Nickel Brook Draught;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;"ive consumed hundreds of these, mostly in bottles. its a fruity golden ale that the brewer says is reminicent of a true ""canadian ale"" from back in the seventies. truth be told its not terrible and drinks fine in place of most pale lagers. id avoid it in bottles but its worth a tick however you come across it."

Delhaize 365 Pils Bier;Champigneulles, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Champigneulles (TCB Beverages);500ml can from Mega Image, drunk at home on a windy May afternoon. Crystal clear straw, loads of lacing and a long-lasting head, no rising carbonation. Aromas mainly bread and honey malts, some hoppy hints. In the mouth, thin, mildly bitter, slightly rotten cardboard, not much flavour, a short finish. Just a cheap-tasting lager in a cheap-looking can. Not terrible, but instantly forgotten.

Delhaize 365 Pils Bier;Champigneulles, France;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Champigneulles (TCB Beverages);50cl can at home (5 IV 2019), as 365 pils beer. Brewed in France according to the can information. This is a 4.4 % ABV sweet budget lager, which is quite okay. The looks are what they are: a firm white coated foam topping a not-that-vivid yellow to golden clear brew, with the collar actually swiftly diminishing. The nose has a metallic, dull and dusty malt character... who could expect more from this discounter beer? The taste is alright though, with a joint corn and wheat aroma making up for a malt mouthfeel. The hops are a bit hidden, for the sweetness hampers the bitter features to be in tune. This is a sweet and rather dull brew with medium carbonation and faint alcohol notes. But it is not to say a bad pilsner. This looks just a nice budget quencher to me.

Carlton Cold Ultra Chill;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Awful, but not the worst beer made by Fosters. Nose is slight wet cardboard, but instead of the soulless flavour of corn syrup, the high alcohol gives it almost a mild malt liquor type body. There is something wierd going on in the aftetaste. I would agree there is almost a mint finish, but whether it is intentional or a by product of cheap ingredients remains to be seen.
Carlton Cold Ultra Chill;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Yes its pretty bad, but better than Carlton Cold. The alcohol content at least gives it some content. There is some odd cool mint in the aftertaste and a very odd sharpish tingling on the palate. Very strange... a nasty chemical experiment, not a beer.
Carlton Cold Ultra Chill;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Not a bad drop, goes down well at a family bbq, tho beware it can knock your socks of pretty quickly, overall i liked this alot better then the colds
Carlton Cold Ultra Chill;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Why are West Ozzie’s first to be subjected to such travesties of the beer world? Far removed from the rest of the country are we the ’Guinea Pigs’, the plebs whose judgement all shite beers depend upon, before hitting the shelves of the east coast. Or are we just the unlucky first to whinge about it on the ’Net. Dropped off by a rep for me to sample. Pours typically gold, thinly looking. A single eddy of bubbles up the centre miss the idea completely as it is totally void of head. There is a little next-day-vomit-on-the-lino’ about the nose. It’s lifted by a fairy-floss sweetness and some undertones of its nasty, chemical, little brother. Sloppy, soapy, and drabby is the near poisonous palate. Artificial sweetener and some Listerine-like mouthwash, minty notes dominate a nearly flavourless abyss of dirty-laundry liquor and subtle oxidised metals. Sweet, tangy astringency on the swallow, drops off quickly, some rancid tinniness with, yes, a little mouthwash and alcohol burn deep. Gets nasty, heavy and more acrid as it warms. The mint becomes annoying as it lingers long. Mouthwash companies warn us not to imbibe on their product, why should we drink this??? Whatever happened to malt and hops? Are the big two so pathetic that they would honestly push this pitiful beverage onto us thinking we will just sap it up??? Idiots!!! (355mL, 17Mar08)
Carlton Cold Ultra Chill;Melbourne, Victoria, Australia;Pilsener - Imperial;Carlton & United Breweries (CUB - AB InBev);Another new beer from Fosters! Guaranteed to be a well crafted brew! Yeh right!! This is made to take on Tooheys Platinum ,pity they can’t just try to make a decent beer for once. The secret ingredient is supposed to give a sort of cool mint taste just after swallowing. To me anything that is supposed to be drunk real cold just hides all the characters in the taste, this one hasn’t got any to hide.

Big head that stays for quite some time - foamy and a touch dirty white. Aroma is powerful - lots of roasted malts, a slight flowery hops note and a slight acidic edge. Flavour is terribly sour. Infected, yet again... There is a good, long roasted aftertaste that witnesses a good brew, but they have to settle their problems - and very soon!!
Daisen G Beer Stout;Tottori Prefecture, Japan;Stout;Daisen G Beer;Backlog. Tap at CBM Koenji 2015. Deep brown to black with a half finger of beige head.

Daisen G Beer Stout;Tottori Prefecture, Japan;Stout;Daisen G Beer;Bottle one month past its (quick) use-by date. L: pours a very dark brown with a huge foamy tan head that sticks around, plenty of lacing. S: a light aroma, some roasted malt, and something mineral or citric. Nothing unpleasant, just light. Better when it warms actually. T: carries a bit more weight than the aroma, malt, a hint of chocolate, something slightly burnt.

Poured a slightly darker, amberish gold with a small white head. Nice malty nose, light light notes of chewing gum (not the wheat beer type). The taste does deliver on the promise of a nice, sweet maltiness, but that’s mostly hidden under layers upon layers of dusty hop, slightly stale and herbal and kinda annoying. Not my type.

Rivertowne Strawberry Shortcake Less;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rivertowne Brewing;Strawberry beers are all the same to me. This was different. Why? Because it tasted like butterscotch. I liked it.
Rivertowne Strawberry Shortcake Less;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rivertowne Brewing;Draught sample as Strawberry Short Cake-less at the Pour House.

Rivertowne Strawberry Shortcake Less;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rivertowne Brewing;Draft sample at the brewpub. Hazy, golden color. Prevelant strawberry nose, with a bit of malt and bread. Very nice strawberry start with a crisp, hop finish, but not too hopy. I’m not a huge fruit beer fan, but this is pretty decent.
Rivertowne Strawberry Shortcake Less;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rivertowne Brewing;Wow, nice fruity strawberry aroma. Smells really aromatic like stawberry Nestle Quick. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color, no hint of the strawberries in the color. I do beleive it has a slight haze to it. First taste is interesting and attractive. But as with most fruit beers, the taste becomes tiring and imitation during the session. If I didn’t see they added real fruit in the description, I would think it was flavored with syrup. After a while, it seems this beer begins to have the impression of flavored children’s medicine. Strawberry is overwelming the rest of the sensation. Barely carbonated. More sweet than most fruit beers I’ve tasted. Lancaster’s Strawberry is much more enjoyable than this and has more tingly carbonation, something this brew is lacking. However, I was very pleased to have had the chance to taste this rare beer.
Rivertowne Honey of a Nut Brown;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;Not a traditional brown but good anyway. Sweet malt aroma from a dark amber pour. Flavor has a bit of the brown flavor but is swallowed up by a sweet honey finish. A bit sweet at the end but quite enjoyable.
Rivertowne Honey of a Nut Brown;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;Sampled on draft at the Rivertowne Pub this beer poured a very dark brown color with a small khaki head.

Rivertowne Honey of a Nut Brown;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;Poured from a growler courtesy of Bob at Pittsburgh gathering on 1/27/08. Deep brown in color, very nice foam and retention. Aroma is is like honey coated crystal malts, does not smell promising.

Rivertowne Honey of a Nut Brown;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Brown Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;Slight sweet or fruity aroma. Brownish darker ginger ale color. Big tan head that does not fade. Earthy flavors without bitterness. Freindly and easy to get along with, pretty enjoyable. Some wet hay taste in there floating along with that earthiness. Has an interesting persisting fruity or sweet honey background lurking in there. Barely any carbonation. Overall, not bad. Does not stack up to East End Fat Gary Nut Brown Ale but certainly much better than Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale and Newcastle. Good job.
Tröegs Scratch 3;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours clear gold with a white head. Fruity sweetness, with light peachy notes, soft spicy notes, and mild oxidation. Hasn’t held up as well as some of the other old Scratch tripels I tried alongside this one, but still not undrinkable.
Tröegs Scratch 3;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Tröegs Brewing Company;"*First and foremost, this review is for how this is drinking right now, not in the past. My scores reflect the last time I had it but didn’t review it.* Big thanks to John for bringing this one to Campground Brewdown this year. Never thought I would have the chance to try it after so long. A - Pours pale yellow with a nice one finger tall white head, slowly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace on the sides of the glass. S - Smells pretty dull across the board. Hints of the past waft in quickly; mainly the dulled spicy belgian yeast, lightly toasted pale malt and candied sugar; quickly being joined by the now dominant wet cardboard and weird vegetal aroma. T - Taste is nearly identical to how the smell plays out. A quick hint of the past quickly devolving into the preset state of affairs. There is plenty of oxidation and weird flavors going on now but not as much as in some of the other ones from this period. M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation. Sweet, prickly feel clings to the palate. Much like the other bottles from this time period this one opened with a loud pop. O - Holding up ok but definitely past it’s prime at this point. Like all of the other super old scratch’s, this is nothing more than a novelty at this point but it was nice to try again."
Tröegs Scratch 3;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Tröegs Brewing Company;A: The pour is a very turbid golden orange color with a thin white head forming a ring around the glass. S: Lots of spice to it and intensely sweet. There’s an almost meaty character to it, too. Fairly decent floral with lots of sugary notes and sort of oxidized. T: This beer is pretty sweet. Caramel sauce, sugar, brown sugar, and fairly oxidized. There’s some floral and maybe honey notes. Definitely old, but not bad. M: The body is medium with a moderate level of carbonation. D: Surprisingly decent for a three year old tripel. I probably wouldn’t want to have this again, but good enough for the tick.
Tröegs Scratch 3;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Tröegs Brewing Company;"A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a two finger thick, pale tan tinged, off-white colored head. The beer is a lightish gold hue that shows a brilliantly clear, bright, yellow-gold color when held up to the light. The aroma smells of ripe melons (more honeydew than cantaloupe, but a hint of that too), overly ripe tropical fruit as well as quite a bit of clove that I somehow at first missed. There is a touch of mustiness that mixes in with the spicy clove aromatics and there might even be a touch of oxidation, but that too seems to be well hidden by the other notes found in the nose. I think that the oxidation might be accentuating the noticed fruit aromatics. Lightly sweet tasting, but quite light bodied for a beer of this strength. It does have some viscous heft to it as it clings just a bit to the palate. The beer finishes with spicy clove and a hint of woody pepper notes. Up front fruit flavors of pear and floral apple are more noticeable than the melon from the aroma, but there are some honeydew melon flavors here as well. The malt has notes of freshly crushed pale malt, a touch of cracker character, as well as some sweet grain character. A touch of oxidation seems to add a hint of almost caramelized character to the malt towards the finish; it boosts the complexity more than anything. A touch of higher alcohols accentuate some warmth towards the finish, but much of this is due to the 10.1% abv alone and this is actually fairly muted given this beer’s strength. This one is barely showing its age yet. There is a hint of oxidation around the edges, but it is so light still that it is only accentuating other components of this beer. This is still quite a nice Tripel and even tastes in better shape than many a “fresh” overseas example that sometimes shows up in stores here in the states. I can’t see this aging a whole lot better here on out and would recommend drinking these now; any more oxidation will likely start to hurt the flavor of this beer."
Tröegs Scratch 3;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottled. An unclear golden beer with a thin beige head. The aroma has strong notes of peaches and other fruits as well as medium notes of malt and yeast. The flavor is sweet with notes of malt, peaches and other fruits, grain, and yeast as well as light notes of milk, leading to a lightly alcoholic finish. The moutfeel is smooth.
Tröegs Scratch 3;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Tröegs Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle shared by shawnm213- thanks again, Shawn! Pours a cloudy yellow-gold color with a very small eggshell white head that doesn’t do much. Aroma of honey, straw, yeast, candi sugar, fruit juice. Flavor is more of the same, with some breadiness to it. Medium-bodied, with a sticky mouthfeel and sweet finish. Pretty sweet all the way through, actually. Good tripel.

Tröegs Scratch 3;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;Tripel;Tröegs Brewing Company;Bottle: &nbsp Straw colored, cloudy, loads of sediment, large white frothy head, nice lacing. &nbsp Very soft floral/spicy nose. &nbsp Has a Witbier element to it. &nbsp Bready flavor, meaty, very clean. &nbsp More malty than floral, which is classic American. &nbsp This is 10.1%? &nbsp Certainly does not taste like it. &nbsp It is very warming, however. &nbsp Thick, bready, but not as floral/spicy as I got out of the nose. &nbsp Moderate to full body and mouthfeel. &nbsp Lingering breadiness. &nbsp Pretty simple, but fairly clean, and certainly on the hot side. &nbsp A little mealy too. &nbsp Enjoyable, just wished it was a little brighter in the floral sense. &nbsp Thanks Dan for this unexpected bottle!

Fruity malty aroma with some hoppy hints. Sweet malty caramel flavor with some hoppy hints. Long malty finish with some fruity hints and a bitter aftertaste.
Hop Back Wilt Alternative;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Not really sure what a wilt is so i am even less sure what to do with an alternative! Really dissapointing beer. Bitterness is far too high and the beer is completely unbalanced. did not finish my pint!
Hop Back Wilt Alternative;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Waterloo Arms, Soton. Light coppery colour. Sweet biscuity malts and light caramel flavours. Earthy leafy hops but quite mild leaving a slightly sweet limp maltiness. Drinkable but I’m glad I only had a half.
Hop Back Wilt Alternative;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Medium colour, HIGH HOP IN LINGER. slightly oxidised hop aroma. average beer from this brewery which is usually good. This is disappoint.
Hop Back Wilt Alternative;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Hop Back Brewery;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. Gold, lasting off white head. Slight yeasty aroma, standard golden ale in mouth, pretty good tingling hop on finish. Decent soft lime/grapefruit. Fine. A Summer Lightning lite? Nice hoppy bite and flavour on finish.
Westerham Holy Smoke;Westerham, Kent, England;Smoked - Rauchbier;Westerham Brewery;Cask handpull at Market Porter, Borough. Gold with lasting white head. Certainly has got smokey malt. Comes through on the aroma like a rauchbier. Weirdly it’s a classic golden ale beneath it. The hop is more muted, some tingle, but good dryness. I would expect the smoke to overpower the rest, but curiously it works.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle poured into a shaker. Pours a clear amber with a half finger of white head. aroma is sweet with honey and a decent floral hop aroma. Taste is fruity with vanilla and oak and some sweet honey. medium bodied with a slick texture. Lively, almost fizzy carbonation and a very long finish. Overall, I’m really liking this one. Not sure where the barrel flavor comes from, but I’m digging this.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;More of a beer than a mead but w/e. It is lgith and herbal, some fruitiness, mead characteristics in body and alcoholicness.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle. Honey, hay, and barley malt aroma. Golden yellow with no head. Sweet honey, orange and light barley malt flavor. Light body. Mild but pretty tasty.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle. Bready malt, honey, and floral aroma. Slightly hazy deep honey gold with a small off-white head. Bready/grainy malt, fruity floral honey, and slight alcohol flavor. Flavor is very simple. Medium body, moderate carbonation.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Pours a clear gold with a thin off white head. Honey, toast, floral hops, spicy hops and oily grain to the aroma. Lots of sharp floral honey and toast flavors. Off dry, to oily feel with a light carbonaiton.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Bottle aged for quite some time and served in my Lil’ Karmeliet tulip: The first pours was a beautiful sunser coppery hue but the second displays lots of little floaties. The aroma is super flowery with just a bit of honey, faded hops and grainy, a bit of oxidization and some earthiness. The taste is surprisingly a bit more bitter and far less sweet than expected which is a good thing! Seems the yeasties really finished off the sugars leaving me with a dry bodied but dry and refreshing beverage. I aged this is hopes of getting some sourness but alas when I want a beer to go bad it doesn’t! However I am more than happy with the results, somehow I am really digging this.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;22 oz bottle from Binnys SL (Chicago, IL). Shared with the Mrs. Pours a near transparent deep orange amber glow, a bit darker, healthy winter sunset hues are darker, striking edges. A frothy whitish head dies to a loose film and laces small. Aromas are a bit grainy, bready malts, a touch stale, honey and wildflowers. Grass, florals, and gentle orange blossom. Gentle apple, a bit of spicy yeast. Bready and grainy. Initial is lighter end of the fold, some gentle fruity elements up front show apple, gentle honey, honeycrisp, and some mellow lemon. Florals and grass, gentle orange blossom. A bit dry and thin into the middle, I catch a touch of heat, a touch of pickle (Where did that come from?!), and some gentle apple elements. Kiss of pear, gentle spritzy dryness into the backend. Grainy, dry bready malts. A touch yeasty, bready, gentle spice. The beer elements comes on stronger back there. A bit of warmth into the lower belly. An odd beer. A bit thin, a bit lacking life for me. The beer itself seems the problem here, not the mead portion which, though small and more gentle compared to others, has some character. I think the beer portion is where this falls flat. Meh.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;Sampled at an esbls tasting. Very clear and kind of cinnamon hued. No head. A honey and fruited aroma. Not big. Honey is tasted with floral notes. No hops tasted. Some light grain. Nice and smooth.
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;"22 oz bottle, Andersons Columbus. Amber pour; slight white head dissipates to a tiny ring. Light aroma is mostly sweet, honey, floral. Flavor also surprisingly light; I get sweetness but not much honey; I would say this is oaked, with notes of vanilla and wood; very light bitterness with a strange flat papery-ness persisting. Medium-light body, medium-light coarse carbonation. I don’t know... this is some fairly unusual stuff, but I think I like it."
Two Brothers Heliocentric Bragot;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Two Brothers Brewing Company;"Purchased at Binny’s in Chicago, IL; enjoyed at a friends house while transferring some homebrew. Appearance is a moderate gold, relatively transparent, small white head that rims around the glass. Aroma is light with a rich honey profile, maybe a little bit of caramel malt. Taste equally rich in honey, definitely sweet, more of a mead than an amber ale. Not bad, unexpected."
Rivertowne Sergeant Furys Red Ale;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rivertowne Brewing;The beer poured average with a deep amber/brownish color to it, very little head, and no lacing on the glass. The smell is average with a caramel malt scent and a mild hoppiness to it. The taste is decent with a definite caramel maltiness, mild chocolate, and a mild hoppy presence on the back end. The mouthfeel is average as the beer is carbonated mediocre, medium bodied, and leaves with a caramal malt sweetness lingering. Overall, an average caramel malt red ale, nothing exciting and lacked in carbonation.
Rivertowne Sergeant Furys Red Ale;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rivertowne Brewing;Draft sample at Pint for Pets. Pours red. Small white head. Nose is all caramel. Taste is much of the same with a clean hop crispness. Tasty red.

Rivertowne Sergeant Furys Red Ale;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Rivertowne Brewing;Smells like hoppy floral perfume. Look is mostly light brown with some red tinge. First taste coats your mouth with an IPA type palate. Certainly creates a fury in the mouth. Impressive hop bite and bitterness, will not quit. Lasting IPA style finish. I feel like I chewed up a handful of green grapefruit rinds. Quite IPA style bitter. If you like hopped up beers, ignore my numbers and go try this out. I just don’t care much for highly hopped brews and did not anticipate the hops in this brew.
Husumer Altbier;Husum, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Husums Brauhaus;Draught at the brewpub. Weak toffee aroma. Caramel/toffee colour. Small, creamy, light brown head. Fruity flavour, caramel and cardboard. Low bitterness.

Sequoia Moto Brew Freestyle IPA;Fresno, California, United States;IPA;Sequoia Brewing Company;Bottle from Hi Time Cellar. Copper pour (I was cutting copper tubing for a homebrewing project while drinking this one), smallish white head. Aroma leans on crystal malt, hops in background. Balance is good here, bitter but sweet caramel handles it. Medium mouthfeel, overall quite satisfying. Could use more hop aroma, but that otherwise this is a nice beer.
Sequoia Moto Brew Freestyle IPA;Fresno, California, United States;IPA;Sequoia Brewing Company;This reminds me of the Full Sail Sunspot IPA I had one time. kind of hazy dark copper with a small head. Smells fruity and tastes the same. balanced caramelly malts and moderate hops. Really fruity. Isn’t a hop monster, hides the alcohol extremely well. The only hint of it being so high is the warming effect a few seconds after it all goes down. A satisfying IPA, not too thick or bitter, but hopheads wouldn’t prefer it to usual suspects.
Sequoia Moto Brew Freestyle IPA;Fresno, California, United States;IPA;Sequoia Brewing Company;Bottle from beer on the wall. I can’t believe I’m only the 3rd to rate this one. At any rate, the pour is chill hazy dark straw color with 2 fingers of off-white head that left long-lasting sheets of lace. The aroma has a nice fruitiness to it, with apricot, peach, and pear notes, plus some hops, honey, and caramelly malt. The palate is medium, with flavor notes of caramel malt, wet hops, spicy peppery notes, and a big fruity taste. This one is very good, and I never, ever would have suspected that it was almost 8% alcohol.
Sequoia Moto Brew Freestyle IPA;Fresno, California, United States;IPA;Sequoia Brewing Company;Bottle poured golen in color with a small white head. Aroma was low citrus and pine with a weak caramel malt profile. Taste is tame for an IPA with more malt and yeast esters in the flavor instead of having hops in your face. Alcohol was noticed in the flavor and the finish was semi dry.
Sequoia Moto Brew Freestyle IPA;Fresno, California, United States;IPA;Sequoia Brewing Company;Aroma is extremely sweet candy malt with small amounts of citrus and pepper. Pours orange gold with a small white head. Flavor is dominated by the strong malty sweetness. It is attempted to be balanced by hops, but they dont really make their presence felt, especially for an IPA with 7.5% alcohol. It finishes with a little earth, a little citrus, and mild strong pepper notes. Residual sweetness hangs around on the palate. I’ve had better.
Mudshark Bridge City IPA;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mudshark Brewing Company;This is a good beginner IPA... not very hopy at all.. Not bitter. Smooth and enjoyable. Would I get it again? Maybe... only on tap and only if i wanted a slight IPA flavor.
Mudshark Bridge City IPA;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;IPA;Mudshark Brewing Company;Aroma is grainy and some odd funky sourness. Really strange for an IPA. It is somewhat reminiscient of an APA I guess. Pours mild hazy gold/yellow with a small white head. Flavor is initially grainy followed by sour hops. Biscuits and citrus. A little perfume. This is an APA. Not very resiny. Finishes dry and crisp. Pretty thin and easy to drink.
Mudshark Mudsberry Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mudshark Brewing Company;Cloudy pinkish pour. Creamy white head. Sour punch straw aroma and berries. Flavor is sweet and a bit artificial. Overall a good fruit beer.
Mudshark Mudsberry Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mudshark Brewing Company;Raspberry reds like fruit loops with creamy white head and lace. Super raspberry dominates the nose. Smooth sweet raspberry flavor with very light hop finish. A tad thin for me but a good beer for the style none the less. Looks like I liked this beer more than most:)

Mudshark Mudsberry Ale;Lake Havasu City, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Mudshark Brewing Company;A sour sweet fruit aroma. Is hazy yellow gold with no head. A wierd wheat sour fruit flavor. If you could tell me what fruit the berry is in this beer I will give you money. Pretty light with medium carbonation. Meh.
Grand Rapids Raspberry Cream Wheat;Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Grand Rapids Brewing Co.;on tap...hazy, largely unfiltered (which is different for the brewery) rose-colored body with medium white head...aroma is large in tart raspberry (hints more to actual raspberry than a syrup substitute)..very similar to Founders’ Rubaeus...(unfortunately the similarities end there)...flavor is that of a watered down raspberry wheat...lacks the artificial qualities that were picked up in the nose...there is a subtle cream/lactose backbone to this which complements the the weak raspberry flavor very nicely, giving it a softer, gentler flavor than that of a tart bite...thin, watery palate as always...its actually more thin than water (if thats possible)...not bad, but nothing to rave about

Bereits im Antrunk erstaunlich metallisch und kribbelnd, trotz des sonst ruhigen Bieres. Feine Schwebteilchen. Würzig mit Brot und Heunoten, dies geht aber durch den metallsichen Geschmack und eine leichte wässrigkeit verloren. Im Nachgeschmack dann mittlere Bitterkeit. Also: weniger Kribbeln und bitte mal ein ordentlich gestaltetes Etikett!

FireHouse Bravo IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;FireHouse Grill & Brewery;Tasted on tap at the 2nd Annual Drakes IPA Festival. This IPA pours a light yellow gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is fleetingly floral and earthy. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are earthy and floral. A medium bitter IPA. A touch drier than the others here today. Good balance. Nice carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.
FireHouse Bravo IPA;Sunnyvale, California, United States;IPA;FireHouse Grill & Brewery;Sampled this brew alongside their ’regular IPA.’ According to the waitress this beer is brewed with one single hop variety. My guess is it’s the new hop called BRAVO (just a hunch). This another nice hoppy brew from the Firehouse Brewery. This time it has less of that classic citrus aroma/flavor and more of the pine. Still has a good amount of malt to balance out the brew. Just enough bitterness rounds out the medium body.Pretty decent beer here.
Taps Vanilla Wheat;Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);On tap at Taps. Aroma of vanilla, wheat, and a little skunk. Fairly solid hefeweizen taste: vanilla, spice, banana. Dry finish. Creamy body.
Taps Vanilla Wheat;Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);Tapped at the Syndicate Restaurant and Brewhouse in Niagara/Canada. Overall not a bad wheat beer, but the character was not as complex as I expected. Mild banana aroma, some spices, nothing really impressive. Hazy golden collor typical for an industrial lager, I missed the thick orange golden color of a good wheat beer. Stable white head. Taste is initial banana and dominant hops, a bit watery, hoppy and some spices, too. Not bad, but once was enough
Taps Vanilla Wheat;Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);Slightly hazy and golden colour. Aromas of muted banana, clove and yeast with a hint of vanilla bean. On the palate it proves tart with a lemon zestyness and has a flavour reminiscent of apple pie. Meh, it is okay but not gonna order this one again.
Taps Vanilla Wheat;Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taps Brewing (Sydicate);bottle. Poured pale hazy yellow with a wisp of a head. Aroma is full of spicy clove and banana. Light mouthfeel, a touch dry. Typical wheaty flavour with yeast and citrus notes. I wouldn’t have known there was vanilla is this brew if it weren’t in the name. Not too offensive.

Town Hall Barrel Aged Foolish Quadrupel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Pours hazy purple/brown with off white head in goblet. Taste is huge malt sweetness that breaks way into a bit of hoppiness and finishes strong with dark fruit and malt with a nice bitter and smooth finish. The barrel aging really smooths and combines the flavors well, and this beer is one I am lucky to have had. Amazing!
Town Hall Barrel Aged Foolish Quadrupel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;(on tap at Town Hall) Pours a muddy brown with an off-white head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. Just an amazing aroma of red wine, oak, vanilla, brown sugar, raisins, figs, light chocolate, pancake batter, and baked bread. The four years of aging must have tamed the alcohol because I am not picking any of it up throughout consumption. The flavor is just as great as the aroma, with a lot of dark fruit, such as raisins, figs, and prunes, with red vines licorice, bread, red wine, and cherry present as well. There’s also a bit of oak, bread, and salt on the finish as well. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation is just a bit high. Being biased towards wine-barrel aged beers, this rating might be inflated, but wow was this a great beer, and it’s just a superb integration of barrel and beer. Well done Town Hall.

Fairly weak aroma: a hint of sweet malt and some oak. Sweet flavor of malt, caramel and used oak. Hides the alcohol well. Nice rich texture on the palate. Finishes sweet with notes of alcohol.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Foolish Quadrupel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;After 20 minutes of vigerous stirring, i got a heavily oaked nose with some dark malt characteristics. My glass smelled stronger than badgerben and akevitts, prompting us to wonder what the heck was going on.. Oaked body with a mix of biscuit and light oak half way between brandy and an exceptionally light bouron (think eagle rare).
Town Hall Barrel Aged Foolish Quadrupel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Brown color with an off white head that was pretty thin. Not much of an aroma. Thick creamy mouth feel, seems very carbonated. There isn’t a whole lot of quad like flavor, there is some chocolate like flavors. A tingling fruit character that is followed up with an alcohol bite. Interesting flavors from the barrel are present but aren’t pronounced and take a back seat to everythng else that is going on.
Town Hall Barrel Aged Foolish Quadrupel;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Quadrupel / Abt;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dark murky copper color with a thin head. Weak aroma of sweet malts, caramel and oak. The flavor is a killer mix of caramel and chocolate malts with brandy oak. Definitely sweet, but not so much it turns to candy. Very nice.
Riverside Imperial Stout;West Bend, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Imperial;Riverside Brewery & Restaurant;Pitch black. Dark tan head. Smelled of alcohol and roasted malt. Great oily mouthfeel, too much alcohol coming forward in the taste. Pretty unbalanced as it warmed, which is not the norm for an impy stout. According to the server, this beer is actually the winning recipe in a homebrew contest sponsored by the restaurant. Overall pretty good, but not at all a good beer to use when trying to introduce real beer to the Miller crowd.

Bud Light Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);Pours a turbid pink red from the tiny can with no head or lace. Aroma of ketchup and bud light mixed. Taste follows, beer tomato sauce. It may be ok if it's spicy, but this is meh.
Bud Light Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);It tastes as somebody drank a bunch of bloody Marys and then threw up. If this was the only alcohol in the world, I would not drink.
Bud Light Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);I tried this can out of desperation while dehydrated in the desert. Lost, dying of thirst, it was the only liquid for 10 miles. The first sip, pure horror. I dumped the can on a cactus and vowed to survive long enough to purge the taste from my mouth. 4.5 out of a billion.
Bud Light Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);From a Can to a Glass. Pours a hazy light red color with a fizzy head that disappeared to nothing fast. Aroma is Clamato and Tomato. Taste follows the aroma well with a light mouthfeel and some spicy heat in the sip. And some carbonation fizziness in the sip. Its pretty good actually.

Bud Light Chelada;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Flavored - Other;Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev);"25 ounce can into pint glass, canned on 8/24/2019. Pours moderately murky/cloudy reddish orange/amber color with a fairly dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation and clinging bubbles on the glass. Aromas of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, and brown sugar; with lighter notes of clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, and brown sugar; with lighter notes of clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness. Mild herbal bitterness and peppery spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tomato juice, lime, salt, garlic, onion, celery, chili pepper, peppercorn, brown sugar, clams, vinegar, cracker, white bread, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitter/spiciness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and lightly sticky/creamy tomato mouthfeel that is fantastic. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Mildly increasing lingering pepper heat through the glass; pleasant and not overwhelming. Overall this is a delicious fruit/spice/vegetable beer. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of lime, clamato, salt, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the mildly bitter/spicy finish. Far exceeded all expectations, definitely one of the best I've had in this category. Most other cheladas I've had were too heavy on tomato juice/body. This is perfect balance of Bud Light and Clamato flavors; with nice malt presence for the style. A very enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example."

Southern Tier Über Sun;Lakewood, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);"Reviewed on 8/26/10. This beer is now retired and that is a real shame. I found a few bottles in a liquor store in Maryland - I don’t even think they knew what great stuff they had. Ap: Very cloudy, light orange, with a slight head, and a generous amount of carbonation. Ar: Hoppy, tangy, citrusy, but still identifiable as a wheat based beer. T: Bitter like an IPA, but it doesn’t have the same grapefruit sizzle. I love the orange finish on this one! It gets even better after every sip. P: Very comfortable drinker with soothing carbonation and mild alcohol presence. O: One of the best summer beers NOT available anymore. This is a beer geek’s ""lawnmower"" beer."
Southern Tier Über Sun;Lakewood, New York, United States;Strong Ale - American;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but probably over 3 years old. Pours hazy golden orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass.

Good amount of earthy pepper spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of honey, wheat, bread, citrus, floral, grass pepper, clove, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Light oxidation present in the taste as well, but not bad. Very nice balance of malt and hop flavors; with good malt/spiciness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this a very good imperial wheat beer, even with the age. Good balance of malt, hop, and spicy flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

Lazy Boy Belgian Strong Golden Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lazy Boy Brewing;Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a soft transparent amber color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a nice pace. Stringy lace. The aroma had some banana, citrus, Belgian yeast, breadiness, and ends with some floral qualities. The flavor leans towards the sweet side initially and ends up warming into the clove nicely. Subtle crisp citrus/banana aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fine sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. ABV felt right as the brewer says. Overall, this was a nicely done Belgian strong ale that I would have again if I could.
Lazy Boy Belgian Strong Golden Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lazy Boy Brewing;Draught in a flight at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber color.

Lazy Boy Belgian Strong Golden Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lazy Boy Brewing;"22 oz. bottle from local grocery. Golden amber with light carbonation (tiny bubbles) and a creamy head that quickly dissipated. Mild aroma with notes of grass and citrus.

Lazy Boy Belgian Strong Golden Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lazy Boy Brewing;"Draught at Portland Craft, Vancouver Hazy light amber color, with creamy head. It’s another sweet imitation of Belgian, without the true yeast character, but with a good level of sweetness, round mouthfeel, sweet malt flavor, lingering fruitiness, low bitterness; it ends with a very light feeling of creamy Italian cheese (stracchino)."

Lazy Boy Belgian Strong Golden Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lazy Boy Brewing;Pour was awfully hazy for a non-wheat beer. High alcohol taste overpowered the flavors in the beer and the first couple tastes reminded me of a barley wine. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Lazy Boy Belgian Strong Golden Ale;Everett, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Lazy Boy Brewing;Why do I have a feeling this beer is going to be a piece of shit? I had a bad feeling as soon as I picked it up off the shelf. Bomber bought at Super 1 in CDA, ID. Pours hazy cantalolupe with a medium cream-colored head that collapses into a blanket of foam after a minute or so, leaving some decent lace. Aroma is similar to rancid meat. Taste is sweet and spicy with a bitter finish. Very strrrraaaannnge. Has a hint of that Duvel character the brewers were undoubtably going for, but a hint is just a hint. They either needed to make a reasonably acceptable clone, go above and beyond Duvel, or make a successful experiment based on the Duvel recipe. This does none of the above.

Hollister White Star XPA;Goleta, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hollister Brewing Company;Draft at Hollister served on nitro so take that into account with the palate etc. Pours a light pale orange with big white head. Aroma is grassy, slight cat piss and some citrus. Taste is more on the pale side of things with the light malt coming through but the dank hops still counter this well with some citrus and a slight caramel. The velvet mouth is awesome as I’m bias for nitro hoppy beers. Definitely knock it down a couple points if it isn’t on nitro.

Hollister White Star XPA;Goleta, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hollister Brewing Company;Pours a slightly cloudy golden straw color with a dense white head. Still moderately hoppy, despite the typical dumbing down effect of nitrogen. There is a good bit of citrus peel and a light herbal hop note, too, maybe some pine. Lightly sweet with aromas of bread. The flavor has a bit more sweet malt/bread flavor than expected from the nose. But, it does have nice citrus peel (mostly orange) characteristics to it.
Hollister White Star XPA;Goleta, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Hollister Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Slightly hazy clear orange amber with a one finger, creamy nitro off-white head, great retention. Served ice cold. Pine hops and sweet caramel malts dominate with a fair amount of herbal dry-hopped character. Flavor adds some earthy notes, and the caramel is more restrained with minimal sweetness. Just before the earthy bitter semi-dry finish (that peaked at a 5), there was a bit of a fruity lemon tang. Light carbonation with a light to medium body. Thought it’d be a little too sweet, but really none to be had. Pretty good.

Rock Bottom Yorktown American Dream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Mug club draft poured on tap at the brewpub (Lombard IL). Pours a golden amber, lighter, decent haze with whitish head, moderate, laces well and sustains well. Aromas are a nice melange of hoppy character, tropical and citrus mix liberally, mellow caramel malt sweetness. A lighter IPA is the impression I get, but not to say flavor is the issue. Initial is bitter, light caramel and pale malts move to fair bitterness of grapefruit and mango sweetness, a decent bitterness, more of a summer sessioner body wise, lighter, but still bringing moderate bitteress to the table. A nice IPA, lighter fare. Finish a bit bitter, some citrus sticking onto the palate
Rock Bottom Yorktown American Dream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Yorktown;On cask at the pub. Light golden amber with a creamy white head that clings to the edge of the glass.

Rock Bottom Yorktown American Dream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Yorktown;on tap at RB Yorktown. pours light golden with white creamy head. aroma of piney, grassy, citrus, and grapefruit. flavors are much of the same and i didn’t find it all that bitter. the feel is also a tad chalky but this is still one hoppy delicious beer. this is probably the best IPA from any of the RBs.3.7. ’09 batch, big pnw hop profile with pinnapple, mango, and citrus, just a touch watery, but this is a very good ipa.3.9.
Rock Bottom Yorktown American Dream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Yorktown;2008 edition, draft sampler. This time around, the beer is hopped entirely with Amarillo, and it shows when I sip it. Big notes of grapefruit and pine. Despite that, the malt is very pale in the glass, and leaves some nice looking lacing. ABV for 2008 is not 7%, last year was 6.4%. 2007 edition, Draft in Mug Club Mug. How is it I keep just missing Cornfield and RayBoy01? I asked the same questions of Tim, and all I can remember is that Amarillo is NOT one of the hops, but you could’a fooled me! Orangey body with quarter-inch eggshell-colored head. Hearty hop and malt smell enhanced by smell of mash from the brewhouse. Lightly toasted and honeyed malts. A slight melted butter texture, which help the bitterness slide down. Hops? Grassy, piney, grapefruity, resiny, take your pick. No alcohol burn, but I’m feeling its effects later on. Not a beer to mess with!
Rock Bottom Yorktown American Dream Ale;Lombard, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Yorktown;When I asked brewmaster Tim Marshall about his hop bill for this version of the RB-generically named ale, he rattled off a list for aromatics, another for bittering, and another for dry hopping, and, yes, I’ve forgotten them and can only remember a bunch of C’s. The end result made for a fine fresh IPA, good for Summer/Fall/Winter/Spring drinking. It pours a cloudy amber body with a decent, slightly off-white head that laced the glass heavily. There’s some caramel in the aroma, but it’s well beneath a layer of pine, grapefruit, citric zest, and sharp floral scents. The malts sweetness provides just enough backbone to support the sturdy hop bitterness. Many of the other patrons seemed to find it to be much more bitter than I did, but as my good friend RAYBOY01 has pointed out to me, we’ve probably become jaded from all of the hop bombs that we imbibe. Still, feeling all that refreshing bitterness in my mouth, when Tim asked me how I liked it, I merely saluted him with my empty, unfrosted mug and waved bartender Mike over to order another one.

Coeur d'Alene Strawberry Hefeweizen;Coeur d Alene, Idaho, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Coeur d'Alene Brewing Company;Poured a pinkish gold color with a moderate amount of lightly-tinted white head. The smell has quite a bit of strawberry pungency, which was actually quite nice. The taste, however, is quite a bit more overpowering and doesn’t taste at all natural, affecting the drinkability, as one sip is decent enough, but as my wife and I tried to finish a sampler glass it began to taste more and more like a fruity malt beverage.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Sparkling Wit;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Good looking, pouring a hazy pale gold body with a respectable head that laces the glass thoroughly. The coriander and chamomile waft into the nostrils first followed swiftly by wheat malt and lemongrass scents. Light-bodied and softly carbonated, it delivers the flavors of a lightly tart wheat, the aforementioned spices, and a bit of zing from the zest. A good drink for warm weather.

Rock Bottom Orland Park Smoke on the Porter;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Sample at Indiana Microbrewers Festival - Aroma of dark roasted and fresh malts with smoke and chocolate. Pours black with small head. Flavor is much smokier than aroma with the roasted dark malts and chocolate rounding it out. Palate is sticky and ashy. If you don’t mind the smoke, this is a tasty brew.
Rock Bottom Orland Park Smoke on the Porter;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Kudos to brewmaster Iain Wilson on this fine rauchbier. While it’s not going to knock you out with its smokiness like one of the Schlenkerla brews, it has enough smoked malt tastiness to keep this lover of the style happy. Nice Porter pour, a dark mahogany body highlighted in ruby with a sustained pale tan head. Good lacing, too. The aroma has some lightly roasted malts, sweet, with a big slab of Virginia smoked ham in it. Medium-to-light bodied, the flavor is carried by the smoked ham and some charred bacon, but it’s well supported (and countered0 by the roasty malt sweetness. Well done!

RAXX IPA;Riverside, California, United States;IPA;RAXX BBQ and Brewery;"On draft at brewery, 02/11/08. Cloudy, unfiltered yellow. Lots of particulate matter swirling around. Mistook this for the hefeweizen at first! No mistaking that aroma, though; grapefruit and pine hops. Taste is a little sweet (though no malt profile is readily apparent) with citrus and piney hop flavors. Simple hop juice, though not badly done."

Rock Bottom Orland Park American Dream Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Growler from the brewpub. Aroma of citrus, grapefruit, caramel. Tropical fruits also. Flavor is mostly floral and citrus hops. Earth, some caramel malt. Fairly light but a light body and active carbonation makes the beer very refreshing. A winner summer IPA, for sure.
Rock Bottom Orland Park American Dream Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Mug club draft poured on tap at the brewpub (Orland Park, IL). Pours a golden amber, lighter, decent haze with whitish head, moderate, laces well and sustains well. Aromas are a nice melange of hoppy character, tropical and citrus mix liberally, mellow caramel malt sweetness. A lighter IPA is the impression I get, but not to say flavor is the issue. Initial is bitter, light caramel and pale malts move to fair bitterness of grapefruit and mango sweetness, a decent bitterness, more of a summer sessioner body wise, lighter, but still bringing moderate bitteress to the table. A nice IPA, lighter fare. Finish a bit bitter, some citrus sticking onto the palate.

Rock Bottom Orland Park American Dream Ale;Orland Park, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Orland Park;Yesterday I had the RB Yorktown spin on this ale. Today I enjoyed the Orland Park version and spoke with brewmaster Iain Wilson about his beer. He told me that he was going for a more sessionable version of an IPA, a goal which he seems to seek with each of his recipes. In that case (as in most others) he achieved what he wanted. It pours a clear orange body with a decent, sustained white head. The aroma is a balance between sweet caramel with a touch of toffee and a hoppy bitterness - grapefruit, pine, earth. The balance of the flavor leans ever so slightly towards the hops and leaves you with a moderately bitter finish. Of course, I’m the type who likes his lips to be blistering after drinking an IPA, but I appreciate the quaffability of this brew. Nice. Rock Bottom Orland Park, Orland Park, IL
Legend Extra Pale Ale;Richmond, Virginia, United States;IPA;Legend Brewing Company;Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured an orange-caramel color with a medium sized foamy orange-white head that lingered and left a bit of lacing. The aroma was tangy, tart and chalky with notes of citric acid and Sweettart candies.

Black Delster;Tehran, Iran;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Iran Behnoush Co.;"My second Iranian ""beer"" sends me right up to joint 7th Iran-ticker in the world. Shared at Leighton’s. Dark orange brown, small ring of tan head. Aroma is toffee apple, very sweet and a little meaty. Body is medium, smooth, low carbonation. Taste is toffee, cola, sweet bready malts. Always good to get some extra vitamin B and C before having a few beers."
Black Delster;Tehran, Iran;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Iran Behnoush Co.;Bottle shared at Leightons pad. Thanks to Daniel of the rare country tick. Clear reddy, full amber coloured pour with a fleeting off white head. Aroma is full raisin, kvas, bread, really sweet, wort.

Black Delster;Tehran, Iran;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Iran Behnoush Co.;Bottle thanks to Daniel. It pours clear deep brown with a small white head. The nose is grainy, sweet malty action, brown bread and molasses. The taste is sweet, watery, malt-driven, brown bread, dried fruits and a light woody note with a short, sort of watery finish. Light body and soft carbonation. Not as sweet as expected. Not undrinkable.

Black Delster;Tehran, Iran;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Iran Behnoush Co.;Can. Dark and clear. Decent head. Smells exactly like Grape Nuts, which for me is a comfort aroma. Has a thin palate but with sugars on the tongue. Mild barley malts. Is like a bowl of Grape Nuts with water, strained. Bland and boring but has enough sugar and malt action to keep me interested. Not bad for a non-alc, as the dark and barley-forward malts have some richer flavors.
Black Delster;Tehran, Iran;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Iran Behnoush Co.;Found at a Muslim grocery in KL. Light brown. Like a chocolatey malta - only maltier. Cereal. Sweet, with hints of toasty, maybe a shade of chocolate.
Black Delster;Tehran, Iran;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Iran Behnoush Co.;Got this from a friend as a joke, but what the hell, I’ll rate it anyway. (Go geostats!) Pours a brownish black with a nice creamy tanned head. So far so good. Aroma is nasty, absolutely fowl malts and cheap hops with sugar, can’t smell again because it’s just too horrible. Flavour... Hmm, dare I drink it? Maybe a little sip with my nose closed? Damned, that didn’t help, this is as fowl as the aroma. Immediate walk to the drain to pour away this horrible and disgusting ooze they call beer.
Baird Taproom 7-Year Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Baird Brewing Co.;"My Bottom Line: The spicy hoppiness and fruity yeast of this Belgian Strong Ale swim within smooth honeyed cereals and delicate effervescence into a drying herbal hop finish. A valiant celebratory ale for a talented brewer. Further Personal Perceptions: -Big-bubbled foam settles into the clear golden. -Deceptively smooth, it does not really show its alcohol content until your glass is long gone. -Citrusy fruitiness accentuates the quenching factor. -The yeast’s fruitiness spans from gooseberries to pears to apple skins, etc. -Balanced, drinkable, flavorful, never aggressive; these characteristics could describe many a Baird beer. On tap at the brewery tap room."
Baird Taproom 7-Year Ale;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Baird Brewing Co.;For a style that I have found in the past quit underwhelming, though I have always enjoyed Duvel, this beer takes the style to another level IMO. Dark golden color with an unassuming nose of apples and pears. The mouth then explodes with flavor, apples, pears, cracked wheat, cookies, caramel and apple sauce. Unbelievable depth from begginning to end. Alcohol very well hidden. The finish is kind of like apple sauce and like the descriptions says, i think this would go great with cake. To Bryan hitting seven years in style, cheer.s
Black Oak Summer Saison - Marmalade Edition;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Black Oak Brewing;Far too bready (white bread) for saison.

Black Oak Summer Saison - Marmalade Edition;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Black Oak Brewing;(On cask at Bryden’s, Toronto ON, June 26th 2013) Pours a hazy bright yellow-gold with a big frothy cask head, lots of lace. Aroma floral, a little tart, orange as expected, other zesty citrus, lightly herbal, yeasty. Flavour was sweet-tart orange, herbal/floral notes, yeast, slightly tangy and lemony, just a little malt, dry and yeasty finish but not particularly bitter, didn’t linger as expected. Mouthfeel soft, smooth but not too thin as expected for a good cask body. Very easy to drink. I like the idea and the balance, but aroma/flavour concentration could have been amped up - know the cask was several days old so perhaps freshness plays into that.

Otteroo pours a nice rich amber color, with a nice white head on top, that has a low retention rate which causes the halo effect and leads to very little lacing. Not a very flattering aroma, biscuity, some hay aromas, grapes, and it has a metallic ester as well. The taste isn’t bad for the style at all, and is better than the aromas. Unfortunately, that metallic taste is there. Definitely very biscuity. Flavor gets a lot better as the beer warms. Almost has a wine-like quality to it. Easy drinking mouthfeel, warms the mouth a little due to the higher alcohol. Mild carbonation. Not a bad beer by any means, but definitely not my style. I wouldn’t mind drinking this again.
Otter Creek Otteroo;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Review from notes, sampled 3/13/2008 Pours a Beautiful crystal clear golden amber color with a fluffy white head that doesn’t stay around to long. Kinda looks like apple juice. Aroma is a bready malty kinda deal maybe a hint of caramel in there too. Taste is lackluster, kind of thin some malt, but feels watery with no body. Very easy drinker, but not one of my favorites.
Otter Creek Otteroo;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1pt 6oz bottle into a pint glass. The label doesn’t list a freshness date or an abv% but there is a short description on the label. Appearance: The body has a deep coppery reddish amber brown color with a thin white head on top. The head is thin and quickly fades to just a thin wispy covering. Lacing is minimal and slick. Smell: The aroma is deep and sweet with heavy dark wheat bread and honey notes. Hop notes are much lighter and add a slight herbal presence. Taste/Palate: Overall there is sweet, almost syrupy, malty bready character like a slice of dark multy grain wheat bread with butter and honey on it. Its body feels full with mellow carbonation and a smooth texture. The finish is sweet and bready/grainy. Notes: The bottle describes this beer as being a sparkling ale with a bright and refreshing taste. I can find nothing like that in this beer. It is hazy, quite sweet and complicated. Overall it is an interesting beer but not one that fits neatly into any style.
Otter Creek Otteroo;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Pours a dark gold and orange with a thick white head. The aroma is somewhat spicy, but very faint. Aroma consists of ginger, coriander, tofee, and caramel.
Otter Creek Otteroo;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Bottle. Pours a golden body with a white head. Bread y dough y body with some sweet fruit esters and dry hoppiness. A hint of cardboard and a mild warming. Decent.
Otter Creek Otteroo;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;From a bottle poured amber with a fair amount of head. Nice light hoppy flavor with a quick finish. Very drinkable.
Otter Creek Otteroo;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Murky color not quite clear with a small white head fades fast. Aroma of some hops with belgian spice and yeast. Some sweetness. Taste is balanced and light with some candy and spice. Alcohol not really noticable, not that great.
Otter Creek Otteroo;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Thanks Crushintor for sharing this bomber which was not finishable but interesting yeasty beer. Woodsy and Sourish yet not a brown, rising carbonation bubbles yet not overcarbonated. Boozy with medium mouthfeel, somewhat creamy, then drying aftertaste. Good off-white head and lacing though blondish coloured body.Unclassifiable, really.
Otter Creek Otteroo;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Otter Creek Brewing;Bottle: Pours a clear golden color with an off white head. Aroma is sweet with malt and butter oxidized. Taste is crazy sweet roasted malts with sugary fruit. Something is off between this sugary sweet mess.
Salopian Hypnotic;Hadnall, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salopian Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Pale greenish gold with white head. Thin summer cross over type beer, would guess at lager malts and hops. Slight cardboard note in an otherwise fairly crisp, sharp body then a sweetish, dusty hop note on the finish. It’s ok but not memorable.
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);10-OCT-2019, bottle @Venice Suites, fromlocal Whole Foods. Hazy orange with a lasting, lacing, creamy, off-white head. Aroma is very fruity with grape friit, over ripe fruit, orange, peach, and some pine. Taste the same with more malty notes. Sweet, bitter, full. Old-school IIPA. Cascade? I guess very nice.
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);For a medium high abv DIPA this has a surprisingly apparent malt presence. Making it a very nicely balanced brew. Hops are central, but pleasantly ‘tamed’ by the (as stated on the can) “generous amount of malt”. Not quite as ‘oily’ a mouthfeel as I expected (based on appearance, as poured). ABV largely concealed. A very well crafted beer.
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Very little carbonation in this one, the beer has a fruity aroma. When it hits your lips you get a fruity taste for just a second but that is quickly whisked away by a bitter wall of malty, piney tasting hops. There is no strong alcoholic taste in this one, although the hops taste really lingers.
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);12 oz can poured into a pint glass. Thought I had tried this one, but no. Well balanced IPA is right. So much that it doesn't seem like a double IPA. No hop burn with this beer. Sounds strange, but this is a session IPA. Definitely give it a try this summer.
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Very disappointing. Too malty for my expectation of a double IPA. Taste was chocolate malt a little coffee more like a porter. No significant Hop presence. Pourd dark Amber head disappeared fairly quickly but did have a little lacing. Carbonation just okay. It's drinkable but that's it. Won't get again
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Hey, what's that! This is not the taste I did expect and I am not really sure if I like it or not. The beer looks super. It has an oily hop taste and a strong honey taste, It also tastes like mint is added. The alcohol is not very Obvious and after the first sip you get used to the beer.
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Nose is mainly malty-resiny. Some honey notes. Slick mouthfeel, nicely-balanced sweetness and bitterness. Not much noble hop flavor. Finish is bitter-salty. Nice double IPA, but doesn't stand out.
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Bottle pour. Cloudy dark orange with a creamy off white head. Aroma is citrus, floral, and light honey. Full creamy body. Salty with a little bitter finish.
Ninkasi Tricerahops Double IPA;Eugene, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ninkasi Brewing Company (Legacy Breweries);Overall really unbalanced...it’s clean for the first sip or two before you become bombarded with all of the hops/malt it really is just a one and done kinda beer.

Dove Valley Ale;Derby, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dove Valley;RIP DVA. An average golden bitter, cropped up in several places round here but failed to make a lasting impression, perhaps a victim of the vigorous micro scene in the county.The hobby-brewers can stump up casks for festivals, to be any more you need outlets that keep your beer turning over. And it helps if the beer is top hole - this was pleasant but indistinguishable from the stock output of many a local brewer.

Williams Brothers Roisin (Cask);Alloa, Clackmannanshire, Scotland;Flavored - Fruit;Williams Brothers (Heather Ales);Tasted this fruit beer at the Troon Beer Festival in October 2008. Cask, handpump dispense. Cloudy in appearance and not obvious pink but a lovely russet amber in colouration with very little head. Open and loose lacing. Very fruity in the aroma with overipe rasberry and bramble notes. Very refreshing mouthfeel. Initial sweet and soft summer fruit flavours in the mouth with little pale malt presence. Delicate floral hop resins slowly appear in the not too drying aftertaste, giving a very refreshing finish which would be ideal for a summer session. Never seen this ale on draught in my part of the world but I think it would be a very popular choice and we need more this type rather than the current plethora of golden ales being touted last summer. Highly recommended.

The palate is creamy and refreshing, pretty good. Overall this isn’t bad but it could be better, it’s a good beer to get the wife or girlfriend.
Black Lotus Funk-n-A Apricot Wheat;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Pouring at the Michigan Brewers Festival during RBSG. Pours a hazed gold, milky, with a thin white head. Soft apricot, nice too, smells like real apricots instead of the artificial stuff that a lot of apricot beers end up smelling like. Light wheat, sweetness. Gentle wheat on the finish. Not too bad.
Black Lotus Funk-n-A Apricot Wheat;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Lotus Brewing Company;i’m not a big fan of fruity beers, but for what this is, it was decent. very fruity smell and flavor. kind of reminds me of leinenkugel summer shandy. your girlfriend might appreciate this one.
Black Lotus Funk-n-A Apricot Wheat;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Lotus Brewing Company;1/12/09 On tap at Black Lotus. Creamy and frothy white head with excellent lacing. Aroma of apricot with Belgian yeast. Flavor is like the aroma, apricot and Belgian yeast throughout. Body is light with a watery texture and soft carbonation. Not a big fan of yeast.
Black Lotus Funk-n-A Apricot Wheat;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Very nice flavor, the apricot being strong without being overpowering. The color is a golden color with a touch of orangeness to it. Good wheat esters that work well with the fruit. Sweet, but not overpowering.
Black Lotus Funk-n-A Apricot Wheat;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Black Lotus Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma is loaded with sweet apricot. It’s a mostly transpent orangish-brown with a moderate off-white head. There’s lots of apricot flavor up front. It finishes with a light lemon tartness and faint grassiness. A little too much on the sweet side for my tastes.
Front Street German Amber Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Front Street Brewery (NC);Draft at brewpub. Clear copper with a nice lasting head. Aroma is fruity caramel. Fruity hops and caramel malt on the front and slight bitterness on the end. Palate is light-medium, a little hop tingly, and slightly watery (refreshing on a 100 degree day).
Front Street German Amber Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Front Street Brewery (NC);Draught at the brewpub. Pours dark copper with slight ivory head. The aroma is very fruity- plum, orange, and lots of berries- and just a hint of caramel. The flavor is toasty with notes of mixed berries, allspice, and yeast. The flavor is like toasted wood, maybe some nuts, and a slightly caramel sweet aftertaste. Not outstanding, but decent.
Front Street German Amber Ale;Wilmington, North Carolina, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Front Street Brewery (NC);Poured a reddish brown color with a good size white head. Had hints of semi-sour fruit, spices, hops, and wheat. Finished with a dry hop taste. Nothing special here.
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Hand bottled: &nbsp Black coffee in color, minor fizzy off-white head, sparce lacing. &nbsp Big spicy nose... trying to put my finger on it. &nbsp I spoze it seems like a cross between menthol, khaffir lime leaf, and Danish salted licorice. &nbsp This is just bizarre. &nbsp On the tongue it has more of a meaty flavor. &nbsp A little ashy, some ashtray, and campfire on the tongue. &nbsp Some roasted malt characteristics appear towards the end. &nbsp Spices fairly strong throughout. &nbsp This one is so strange I can’t decide if I like it or not. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are full to moderate. &nbsp This is probably one of the strangest concoctions I have ever had. &nbsp Still shaking my head... lots of flavors that don’t seem to blend together very well. &nbsp Thanks Jeff for the unexpected bottle!
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Tap. Pours cloudy dark brown with a tan colored head. Aroma is yeasty, dark fruit, spicy. Flavor is caramel, dark fruit, spice, light citrus. Palate is medium bodied, medium carbonation, finished roast and spicy. Decent. A tad on the watery side.
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub: Dark in color with a spicy fruitcake nose. Some added dark fruit in the rich, balanced palate. An interesting brew that just got a bit lost with the other beers tasted.
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;From a bottle filled from a growler filled at BCTC. Pours opaque black, with extremely fine bubbles that rose to a head of two inches with a longish pour. The dense head of dark beige fell within three minutes, and revealed a partial skim coat on the surface and some decent webbed-lacework. Aromatics are heavily spiced with cardamom. A medicinal-menthol tinge comes through the slightly acrid and roasty profile. A bit of Vics vapor rub amongst roast coffee beans and bakers chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, and creamy. The pallet is fairly mild, with the spicing not as apparent as the aromatics suggested. Roasted malt, toasted cocoa nubs, and coffee grounds give way to a blend of citrus zest and spicy phenols. Finishes with lingering roast and warming spice. Alcohol is nill, and overall, the brew is more drinkable than when first sampled back in the summer. Age has improved this beer.
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"On tap at the Three Floyds pub. Deep chocolate brown pour; golden brandy edging and thinly topped with grey-tan foam. Phenolic and strange intrigue in the aroma; banana, cranberry, dill and garlic in an initial intimation of sweet pungency. Drier tones of cardamom and anise chase it a bit toward the end. Slightly metallic with mineral notes. Flavor brings a big banana sweetness that hums over the top of thick dark bread, nutmeg, black licorice and sweet squash flesh. Really odd, and cool; plenty of salt, dry wood and nutty oils. Gently carbonated, medium in body and deftly presented. Waxy in the finish with red apple peel; a fairly long life. Understated in its spicing and quite careful altogether; very nice."
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;It was heavy on the Belgians at Three Floyds that day. Not a preferred style but very tolerable done 3F style. Good-looking dark chestnut body with a frothy tan topper. Fruit cake came to mind with the spiciness, gingerbread, fruit that was in the nose. Rich and smooth in the mouth. The flavor was a well-blended echo of the aroma with a slight aftertaste of fennel.
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;On tap at the brewbub. Served in a long stemmed tulip glass. Seems to be black in the dim lights. A smidge of white head that seemed to fade really quickly. The aroma seems to have the floral perfume scent. A little bit of fruit sugars, and a pinch of dark malts. It really tastes like perfume too. With a dry roasted malt bitterness. On the thin side. High carbonation. Dry finish. Certainly interesting, and I’m glad to have been able to try it.
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Tap at Floyds, served in Tulip glass: Deep brown hue with a fading head and spotty lace. Nice deep dark fruit and spiced nose. Notes of cardamom, star anise, mint, and grains of paradise. Fruity esters of prune and fig in addition to toasted almonds, rye bread, and Belgian dark sugar. Very inviting and phenolic. The taste starts quite fruity and sweet. Notes of toffee, nuts, and a ever present spice character. Never cloying despite the sweetness, helped I think by the spices. The mouth feel is medium-bodied, oily and lively, matches the flavor profile well. A great black beer with complex character, I dig it even if some of you don’t get it. A wonderful change of pace to the standard FFF fare.
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;"Draft in Trappist glass (or tulip), 3F’s. Hey, look... it’s black! And with a creamy white head on top. Lots of Belgian spice in the nose; I’ll call it coriander and grains of paradise. Spices roll throughout the tongue like Blackjack gum, maybe even like Kvas. Black version of Belgian malts there, and some raspberry and currant notes. Spiciness dwindles further down, leaving more of an ""old ale"" taste. Yummy, and different from the usual Floyd fare."
Three Floyds Gorm Noire;Munster, Indiana, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Pours a deep black color with a thin light brown head. Aroma and flavor of spices, dark malt and a powerfull sweetness. I found the sweetness too present and the mouthfeel is very syrupy.
Coronado Hoppy Friar;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Draught at Capone’s: Aroma of tropical fruit, citrus, hops, sugar, mango, berries, and slight Belgian yeast.

Coronado Hoppy Friar;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Draft at brewery, rating taken from notes. Amberish in color with a clear body. Sticky lace and almost non existant white head. Aroma of malt/caramel, citrus in orange and lime, and yeasty cobwebs. Has a light and fizzy carbonation with little tiny bubbles. Thin on the palate. Flavor is moderately bitter, moderately sweet, lightly acidic, and long in duration. Has a lasting bitter and slightly piny finish with lingering ctirus tartness balanced by some sweetness. Very interesting beer and a bit warming. Nice hoppiness with the yeasty fizzy character of some of the Belgians.
Coronado Hoppy Friar;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Clear golden orange with a small white fizzy head. Grapefruit and lime aroma. Thick sticky syrupy palate. Strong sweet refreshing citrus tastes: orange, grapefruit, lemon with a sweet hoppy finish. At 9% alcohol, this is still a very drinkable beer.
Coronado Hoppy Friar;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;"Golden; small head. Straw and hop aroma and flavor. Big, rich, biting, white pepper, yet very tasty. The Belgian yeast makes this IPA very tasting and interesting. Drank at brewery. This yeast was first used in their Limelite Wit, then the Belchin brown, and now the Hoppy Friar!"
Coronado Hoppy Friar;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Cask. Hamilton’s. Complimented the sausage platter nicely. Hoppy, yet distinctly Belgian in flavor. Super cloudy. Can’t see though it. Almost like delicious hoppy sweet gravy. I love gravy and I love beer, so there’s no reason why I wouldn’t be crazy about this ale. Well, I am crazy about this ale. And sausages because beer and sausages go well with each other. Like coffee & smokes or ham & swiss. Some shit just works well together.
Coronado Hoppy Friar;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;On tap @ brewery. CBC is on FIRE. This is another great beer from them. It’s like 70% IPA and 30% Belgian golden ale, and it works flawlessly. Hoppy, yet drinkable and tasty.
Coronado Hoppy Friar;Coronado, California, United States;IPA;Coronado Brewing Company;Belgian Style IPA on Cask at Hamilton’s 2nd Saturday 7/14/07. This was a really nice treat and tasty pretty strange and different. Pours a really interestingly thick apple cider look with a color that is pretty similar to that mashed fruit look with a thin head. I know that description is bad but it kinda looked like baby food in liquid form. The aroma was a bit yeasty with a nice light hoppy belgian vibe. The taste is light with hoppy grapefruit notes. Some wood also comes through. This was extremely smooth and easy to drink. One hell of a cask beer.
Dugges Brandmästare Andréns Törstsläckare 4%;Landvetter, Sweden;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dugges Bryggeri;"Draught at Glenfiddich Warehouse N. 68, Stockholm Hazy orange to light amber color; creamy head. Nice hop aroma, English style, creamy, fudge, nettles; buttery.

Dugges Brandmästare Andréns Törstsläckare 4%;Landvetter, Sweden;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dugges Bryggeri;Pours out in ahazy pale reddish orange colour topped with a firm white foam.

Dugges Brandmästare Andréns Törstsläckare 4%;Landvetter, Sweden;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dugges Bryggeri;Draft. A dark golden beer with a creamy beige head - beutifully served. The aroma is lovely powerfully hoppy with notes of flowers, spices, perfume, grass, honey, and wet pine forest. The flavor is sweet malty - but very early a dryness sets in due to lack of residual sugars, which also make the body thin, but the flavor has notes of spices, flowers, and light notes of honey, leading to a slightly bitter and very dry finish. For me more residual sugar would have made it fantastic, but it is still a very good beer.
Dugges Brandmästare Andréns Törstsläckare 4%;Landvetter, Sweden;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Dugges Bryggeri;Draught at DTE. Clear cobber - white edges.

Aroma has notes of malt, yeast, dried fruits and alcohol. Taste is medium sweet and light bitter with a long warm, yeasty and fruity finish. Body is full, texture is oily, carbonation is soft.
Portsmouth Grand Cru;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Portsmouth Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. It pours an unclear, yellow body under a small, white head. The aroma is pretty weak, there’s some higher alcohols, a sourish fruityness, pale malts and a generic fruityness. It’s medium-bodied, dry and with a nice carbonation level. It’s lightly sour on the palate, some grains showing up, but mostly it’s of the fruity kind. A touch of alcohol too. Fruity finish with some sourness. A rather boring one. 150608
Portsmouth Grand Cru;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Portsmouth Brewery;22 oz. bottle shared by brew3crew. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. The aroma is fruity, sweet caramel, light yeast and some alcohol notes. The flavor has fruit, golden raisins, caramel, candi sugar, doughy malt with some light grassy notes to the finish. Nothing spectacular here.
Portsmouth Grand Cru;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Portsmouth Brewery;Golden straw with fizzy white head. Smells of coriander, candy sugar, yeast. Taste is yeasty, bit of hops, coriander. Body is crisp and on the thick side. This came off as a pretty ’blah’ trippel to me.
Portsmouth Grand Cru;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Portsmouth Brewery;Bottle shared by B3C. Poured clear golden color with medium white frothy head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Medium to heavy sweet malt, bubblegum and yeast aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate to long duration. Complex drinkable brew.

Portsmouth Grand Cru;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Portsmouth Brewery;Pours clear amber into a snifter. Bright white head with medium retention recedes to skim surface leaving trailing lacing. Bubblegum aromas. Sweet bubblegum from front to back. Lasting sour fruit finish...liked the cask on peppercorn better...
Portsmouth Grand Cru;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Portsmouth Brewery;Vintage 2007 Pours clear orangy-gold, with a humble quarter-inch head of white. A few dots of lacework and no real retention to speak of. A placid surface throughout. The aromatics are laced with tropical fruit, bubblegum, and phenols. Tangerines and passionfruit with hints of golden raisins and light rum. Medium bodied, a bit sticky and syrupy. The low carbonation detracts. Quite juicy and fruity on the pallet. Peaches with shades of Grand Marnier, pear bubblegum, and cracked coriander. Alcohol is barely apparent, and the beer drinks quite fast. Finishes with lingering ripe fruit, lightly sweet malt, and warming alcohol. I was relatively unimpressed with this beer young, but after almost a year it has really cellared into something special. Too bad on the low carbonation. If this was carbonated like a Belgian should be, it would be over the top!
Portsmouth Grand Cru;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Portsmouth Brewery;"Draught snifter at the brewery on 7/6/07 Definitely an interesting take on a ""Grand Cru"" though there certainly are other examples of mid-gravity Belgian grand crus out there. Medium clarity throughout an auburn-mahogany body that is topped by a small, fully dissipating beige head. Light carbonation in the liquid. Rather sweet, simple caramel-toffee sweetness in the nose has some candi sugar hardness attached to it. Soft vanilla and other light spicing is apparent, though I cant quite put my finger on what it is exactly. It’s very distinctive though, something like allspice or heavily candied ginger. Moderate esterization is evident on the finish, and quite pleasant, though the nose certainly dosent display any vast complexity. The yeast didnt seem like it did a whole lot of work here, though not to say that this is underattenuated. Just seems like a very Belgo-American hybrid beer, with lots of focus on the caramel, toffee and spicing. No flaws. Sweet again in flavor, with some dates, raisins and hints of chocolate on the finish. Toffee throughout most of it, with vanilla and clove/allspice spicing adding some intrigue. Very low, exceedingly loose carbonation is its greatest fault, giving the beer too little apparent body and showing some thinning/wateriness on the end. Alcohol warmth is sligthly apparent, though certainly not problematic or fuselic."
Portsmouth Grand Cru;Portsmouth, New Hampshire, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Portsmouth Brewery;(draft) Cloudy dark amber topped by the scintilla of an of-white head. Aroma is moderately sweet, candi sugar, some orange, light alcohol. Taste is medium sweet, candi sugar, some orange, light clove, cardemom, alcohol. Low carbonation, medium-full body.
Au Maître Brasseur LAltesse;Laval, Quebec, Canada;Altbier / Sticke Alt;AMB - Au Maître Brasseur;"pours a very dark amber almost brown. Interesting aroma of dark caramel malt,and some corriander, and pine. Flavour is actually quite woody, and piney, with an odd aftertaste of kosher dill pickles, and is quite bitter in the finish. Wow, this is odd. I""m not liking this."
Point 150 Anniversary All Malt Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Great Taste of the Midwest, 2017. Amber color, tall head. it looks good. Simple malt flavor with a little sugar and that is about it. it might be more of a Vienna than a pale lager but it is disappointing they did not put more effort into their anniversary beer.
Point 150 Anniversary All Malt Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;pours a clear strong gold with mild white fluffy head. slight smooth light aroma, smooth palate with refreshing qualities, good in that it does not leave the bad after taste of the other light lagers, pretty smooth and it stays in the glass and not your palate.
Point 150 Anniversary All Malt Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Not sure why an all malt beer is listed as a Pale Lager rather than a Premium Lager. Style isn’t dictated by quality. Oh, well. It pours a pale yellow body with a short-lived fizzy head. No lacing. The aroma is sweet and grainy with a bit of earthy bitterness. The hops get grassy in the flavor, although they’re still a little soiled. Suitable as a lawnmower beer.
Point 150 Anniversary All Malt Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;"Pours a transparent fizzy golden with a thin, wispy white head. Aroma of softly sweet grainy pale malts and some noble hops. Body starts with some effervescent carbonation and mild sweetness drying out more toward a semi-bitter finish.

Point 150 Anniversary All Malt Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Straw color with a smallish bright white stable head. Grain aromas with hint so malt and a touch of floral hops. I would have to say the flavors follow the aromas closely, with light malt and grain sweetness and a little hoppiness that just sneaks in in the finish and evaporates like the rest of the flavors. A touch more depth than the special, but perhaps I am just looking for something.
Point 150 Anniversary All Malt Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Pale gold color with a very thin fizzy head. Aroma of grain and light malt. Not a lot of malt in the taste, mostly grain and a tingle of hops. Not much different from Point’s standard offering. I was expecting something more from a 150th anniversary edition.
Point 150 Anniversary All Malt Lager;Stevens Point, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stevens Point Brewery;Hay like grain aroma, light pale yellow color, extremely light malt taste with a hint of hop zing,refreshing I suppose, just not that tastey,especially for a 150th anniversary brew. Positive points for no bad aftertaste

Rogue Chitose Hascup;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rogue Ales;My Bottom Line: This Golden Ale’s overt, tart fruitiness spans from pickled plums to wild blueberries as its cereal sweetness forms a firm base near caramel levels. This is far from Rogue’s finest, but it remains an enjoyable, eccentric Fruit Beer. Further Personal Perceptions: -A nice sheet of foam dissolves cloudy blond. -Carbonation is prickly, lightening the well-fed body. -Citrusy hoppiness adds depth. -Simple and refreshing, as well-brewed as any other Rogue, just not the kind of beer I’d have often. Bottle at Beer Inn Mugishutei.
Rogue Chitose Hascup;Newport, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rogue Ales;Pours hazy gold with slightly off-white, nice looking head. Aromas are sweet, with a bit of berriness, I’m guessing from the Hascup berries, although I don’t know what they smell like. Flavors are quite interesting, something of a lighter beer ale, no significant hop bitterness, but slightly sweet and balanced nicely by the sourness from the berries. Nice sharp sourness, maybe halfway to a lambic in terms of puckeriness. Sourness disappears fairly quickly and leaves a short, clean finish. Quite interesting and enjoyable.

Brown in colour with some light cocoa on the nose. Unremarkable in the flavour department but it still manages to tick the right boxes, bit sweet at times but balanced by some hoppiness not bad at all.

I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Ins Glas ergießt sich ein Bier von hellem Bernstein. Für ein Dunkles ungewöhnlich hell. Der Geruchstest fällt primär süßmalzig aus, leichte röstmalzaromen kommen hinzu. Der Antrunk ist ebenfalls sehr süßmalzig, der Abgang hallt nur sehr kurz süßmalzig nach, danach ists absolut neutral. Die Röstmalznote bleibt komplett fern, lediglich ab dem Mittelteil ist ein leicht rauchiger Touch zu entnehmen. Mir persönlich viel zu süß, die Abwechslung fehlt. Als absoluter Liebhaber von Dunklen bin ich von diesem Bier leider enttäutscht."

Felstar Lord Essex;Dunmow, Essex, England;Old Ale;Felstar;3rd February 2011 Chelmsford Winter Beer Festival. Loads of beers shared with ChrisO and Harrisoni - Cheers! Hazy brown beer, no head.

A bit sweetish with a slightly under-brewed malt feel. Lots of licorice and a touch of fisherman’s friend. Also some sharp fruit. Decent but doesn’t quite come together for me.

Haywards Black;Bangalore, India;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Mysore Breweries (AB InBev);The first stout beer that got brewed and commercially sold in India between about 2006 - 2010 , Smoky , sweetish flavourful but not as bitter or thick as say a Guinness or an Irish Murphy’s Stout and pales in comparison to the aforementioned . With imported stouts now being readily available in the Indian market , this beer would have just ended up being a poor man’s replica if it was still in production . Currently retired from SABMiller catalog .

Cains Organic Wheat Beer;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Wheat Ale;Cains;Brown 500ml bottle, best before July 09, drank in Mar 09. Poured into a Franziskaner Weissbier glass. Looked like a darker than normal crystal weiss bier, but otherwise the same as you’d expect from Germany. Plenty of bubbles and a good white head. The aroma reminded me of Belgian Blondes, not Wheat beers. No banana or vanila, but there is a smell of melon and kiwi fruit. The taste isn’t your normal Weissebier one either, not as tart or citrus in flavour, but tangy and sharp non-the-less. The combination of wheat and barley malts certainly give it a pleasant taste and mouthfeel, if not the traditional wheat beer flavours don’t appear. This is a very drinkable beer and although not true to type and why should it be? I liked it and wholeheartedly recommend it.

Free State 1854 Helles;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Free State Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. On tap in August 2009. Pours a moderate golden color with a white head and just a bit of lacing. The nose is really faint with a bit of grainy sweetness and some very mild hops. Just a bit of diacetyl comes in. The taste is, unfortunately, a bit of a butter bomb. Not much past that. Creamy feel with a pretty decent body, but I can’t get past the off flavors.

The nose is a light graininess, very similar to a Bohemian pilsner. Medium-bodied and slick with a crisp, clean finish. A round pilsner malt front dominates the flavor with a slightly nutty backing and a nice tight finish. This is a good session beer; definitely an example of a beer where the overall impression is greater than the sum of its parts."

Felstar Crix Gold;Dunmow, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Felstar;A Mes rate: Cask at Chelmsford Beer Festival. Great dark golden appearance. A lovely drop of English. Very straight forward prickly hop dominated beer. Very little to it but it’s just a real treat.
Black Lotus Claw-Town Brown Ale;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a semi-dark orange/copper color fading into some brown hues. Finger’s worth of eggshell white to off white foamy head that dissipated at a mild pace. Light lace. The aroma had some roasted nuts, light caramel, mild sweet chocolate and a touch of earthy woodiness. The flavor shaped itself around the previously mentioned aromas nicely. Mildly blended aftertaste and finish. The feel was about medium bodied, perhaps just a touch under with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine and the ABV felt as projected by the brewer. Overall, nicely done brown ale worthy of more pours if I could get them.
Black Lotus Claw-Town Brown Ale;Clawson, Michigan, United States;Brown Ale;Black Lotus Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma consists of roasted nuts with some faint chocolate. It’s a transparent orangish-brown with a small off-white head. The flavor starts with faint caramel with a big roasted nut backbone. It finishes with some faint chocolate and mild bitterness.

Storm Hurricane Hubert;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);Cask conditioned at The Old Harkers Arms, Chester. Brown to amber with white head. There were some adverse comments even before I got to try this, i found it not quite as bad as they were suggesting, but still it was highly perfumed, tangy, quite sour on the tongue, like a mash with cider added. The sorness masked any hints of hop, quite unfortunate.
Storm Hurricane Hubert;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);A Mes rate: Cask at Chelmsford Beer Festival. Lovely perfumey hop nose with some faint sweetness. Similar nose but not quite so tasty. Actually pretty good there is just not enough action.
Bell's Batch 8000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;The aroma is not Belgium, more farm, hay, wheat. Pours a golden brown with light tan head, fully diminishing. The taste is yuck, old and sour/breadish. Damn it, this one doesn't age well. Damn it, Damn it, Damn it!!!!!
Bell's Batch 8000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;From Nov 2007 This one pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy orange with a small but firm head of foamthat all but disappears by the time I'm down to the last 1/3 of my glass. The smell has notes of yeast, clove, and fruit...mostly lemon and some banana. The taste has a medium light body full of clove, yeast, banana, apricot, some citrus, and wheat. It also has an earthiness to it and the alcohol is evident after the swallow. After a few more sips, and this is definitely a sipper, I can taste some corriander(sp?) and some other spice. I will say that none of the flavours really jump out at you..they are on the mild side but they are tasty. The finish is slightly bitter and a bit watery. Still, a pretty good souped up version of the style and I like it. Would I seek it out again?(I bought this online from Vintage Cellars) Probably not. If it were available locally..again, probably not. Not knocking it, mind you, it's just not interesting enough to warrant a repurchase. Edit Nov 22, 2007: Okay, after sampling a few more bottles, I find that I may have been too harsh in my original review. The flavours *are* there in abundance and they are quite flavourful. I've adjusted my rating accordingly and yes, I would seek this one out again though that may be a tough thing to do as it's a one of. Mmm...the spices really do work so well together...

Bell's Batch 8000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;12 oz bottle shared with Jason and Brian. The pour is a light ambery gold with a decent murky appearance. There is a tiny collar of white head and no lacing. The aroma smells like apple pie filling. There is a little cinnamon and some strong apple. There is a light malt and some light coriander. Maybe a light Belgian malt and a nice yeast. The flavor is somewhat apple pie filling as well. There is a nice fruitiness and a good cinnamon to accompany the yeast and malt. It's really solid. The mouthfeel is good. There is a nice thickness and a good carbonation and a lingeringly malty appley finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Bell's Batch 8000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;355ml bottle. Hazy yellow golden color with off white head. Yeasty, malty and hoppy aroma, spicy, coriander, citrusy fruity, banana too. Sweet and bitter taste like aroma. Medium oily body with soft carbonation.
Bell's Batch 8000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;Bottle drunk fresh back in 2007 Large frothy white head tops a very slightly-hazed deep golden-yellow body. Moderate retention. Very dry wheat and spicy phenols in the nose are at odds with the acidic, strong fruit esters showing overripe peaches and apricots. A lot spice apparancey, but that’s pretty expected this young. Moderate strength of aroma, some sweetness certainly grows as it warms and the alcohol is quite rampant after a while. The problems from the nose are of course manifested in the flavor. It’s very malty and sweet, yet extremely estery, phenolic and spicy. Quite a hot mess, as young Batch X000’s always are. A second bottle, aged a year proves much more enjoyable, with some of the sweetness knocked down a notch. Very estery still, with less spice. The alcohol is still rather firm, however. Very authentic Belgian yeast is written all over this beer, there’s just way too much of it.

Ellicottville Bourbon Barrel Imperial IPA;Ellicottville, New York, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Ellicottville Brewing;Growler. Slightly cloudy copper-orange body with a small white ring of head. The aroma has bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, bread, though not much in the hops area.

Odell Bourbon DoyleBock Doppelbock;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Odell Brewing Company;Draught @ the brewery. Dark brown in color with shades of ruby. Aroma wasn’t quite as powerful as the non barrel aged version. Flavor profile was nicely balanced, but overly subtle and not very powerful. Didn’t seem like this was aged in bourbon long enough. It seemed to mute more flavors from the original beer than the wood added.
Crown Brown Ale;Sheffield - Walkley, South Yorkshire, England;Brown Ale;Crown Brewery;A dark cola brown coloured beer with a thickish off-white head. Light, toasted malt nose, a hint of bread, but a little like wet cardboard!

M&B Mild (Cask);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Heritage Brewing Co. / William Worthington Brewery;"Very surprised to see this on a pump clip, thought it had gone forever. Found in The Three Fishes, Shrewsbury on 11th May 2019. I had a hand-pulled half-pint; didn't want to get drunk on the huge 2.8% ABV. Nice dark brown body, beige head of lasting foam. Malty and watery, just like it was 'back in the day' when it came from Birmingham during the 1970's. Nostalgia is a good thing, this beer was never 'a good thing' though. Scored kindly!"
M&B Mild (Cask);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Heritage Brewing Co. / William Worthington Brewery;The Chequers Inn, Bulkington. Clear ruby pint with a smothering blanket of Gillette. Appetising nose of vanilla, chocolate, even a faint oakiness. A dusting of coffee in the mouth, and a teasing barreliness as it warms. Better tepid than cold. Surprisingly good.

M&B Mild (Cask);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Mild Ale;Heritage Brewing Co. / William Worthington Brewery;Cask Conditioned. O.k I quite like this, maybe its because I'm from Birmingham where this mild was one of the big sellers. Mild was aimed at the Foundary workers who couldn't trust the local water, so they drank a low volume beer that quenched their thirst. The beer used to be free at some foundary's. Hence the lightness in flavour, it's not meant to be anything other than a thirst quencher and reasionably decent for that.

Old Capitol Bike Tree Wheat;Iowa City, Iowa, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Old Capitol Brew Works and Public House;On tap @ the brewpub 07/19/07. Hazy honey golden with a one finger white head, eventually fading to a thick creamy film. Aroma is yeasty, good spicy clove and lots of banana notes with some light crisp wheat and sweet malts in the background. Flavor has more wheat and a tinge of lemon, banana still present with the clove coming on a little bit lighter. A hair amount more bitterness (earthy hops) than what I’d have expected from a hefe, but that’s fine with me. Light carbonation with a light to medium body. Very good U.S.-made hefe.

Rock Bottom Chicago American Dream IPA - Shimkos Simcoes;Chicago, Illinois, United States;IPA;Rock Bottom Chicago;Pours cloudy golden with a half-inch head of medium duration. Moderate lacework followed. Aromatics are an almost pungent blend of grapefruit, cracked garlic, cut grass, and orange pith. Medium bodied and crisp. Bone dry and quenching. Light malt and heavy-handed hopping lead off the pallet. Loads of drying grapefruit zest, pine dew, orange oil, and an almost lemony zip. Finishes with a firm, drying bitterness, lingering citrus, and mild alcohol. What a great beer for a Rock Bottom to put out. Now I know why people speak so highly of the Chicago location. Only $9.00 for the growler, including the glass!

Banana oranges and some spice in the flavor, not overdone on the spices which makes this enjoyable. Hides the alky content well for 6%. There is a slight alky bite that builds as you drink but it is not in your face. Overall, a well behaved and enjoyable weizenbock, like-able and friendly.
North Country Breakfast Blend Mild;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;North Country Brewing Company;Pours brown with a thin khaki head. Big and I mean big caramel malt on the nose which was such a big surprise it knocked me back a smidge. The maltiness on the tongue was a bit more subdued especially compared to the aroma but it never becomes cloying either. Clean finisher. Fantastic session beer.
North Country Breakfast Blend Mild;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;North Country Brewing Company;Sampled at Penn Brewery. This beer started with so much in the aroma. The aroma was HUGE! Very strong creamy caramel with a hint of toastiness. The pour was a dark brown with a one finger off white head. Taste was where the let down came. There wasn’t any. It seemed to just turn to water in the mouth. I know mild ales are very weak ABV-wise, but it’s possible to give them flavor while maintaining the weakness. Decent carbonation for the style, however. If this had a little more flavor it could be great.
North Country Breakfast Blend Mild;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;North Country Brewing Company;A- Dark translucent red/brown body with 1/2 finger creamy off-white head.

Rich toasty chocolate malt up front with hints of caramel malt behind it. T- Rich toasted chocolate malt upfront with solid caramel malt backbone-reminiscent of a unsweetened caramel coffee. This flavor last the whole way through with a mild bitter coffee flavor remaining. Taste is very similar to this brewery’s feedbag stout-big taste for such a little beer. P- Low carbonation and rather thin body. O- This is a good drinkable brew. The flavor is too big for a long session ale (for me at least)-but the low ABV makes it great for any time of the day and the flavor you get is well worth it. A great low ABV beer to have when you don’t want an alcohol kick. Serving type: on-tap Reviewed on: 08-25-2007 22:17:20
North Country Breakfast Blend Mild;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;North Country Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Nice roasty smoky nose with caramel and brown sugar. Light bitter hops character. Dark brown clear with no head. Medium body with high carbonation. Starts dry and roasty with bit of sweet caramel. Good bitter finish and after. Smooth and light nutty after and light smoky character.
North Country Breakfast Blend Mild;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;North Country Brewing Company;Draft sample at brewpub. Pours brown with orange hues, white rimming head. Nose is surprisingly coffee and roasted malt. Taste is coffee, malt, and a mild bitter. Almost a porter with too much caramel taste to it. Bitterness is solid enough, but a bit, well, mild for a mild. Tasty concoction.
North Country Breakfast Blend Mild;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;North Country Brewing Company;On tap at the brewery. Pours a reddish copper brown with a small off-white fizzy head that’s gone after a few seconds. Aroma has some grainyness and coffee. Flavor has a little bit of carbonic bitter. The coffee is very noticeable. A light taste and body make it a pretty solid mild. This might be pretty good on some nitro.

North Country Breakfast Blend Mild;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;North Country Brewing Company;Draught. I can see why this is called a mild, but the coffee like aromas and such took me by surprise. Arrives a deep brown color (like walnut) that has a thin appearance to it. Aromas are of coffee and topsoil. Really light ABV (3.8% if I recall), and flavor is similarly mild, in spite of the dark, stouty flavors. I don’t know that I’d sell the house for another, but it is interesting.
North Country Breakfast Blend Mild;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;North Country Brewing Company;Typical beer aroma with just a hint of coffee. Rootbeer color with a creamy off white head. The taste of this is very interesting and pleasing. Coffee flavors abound, but it is not a big bitter black coffee falvor. The best of the coffee without the oppressiveness. It comes across like a very mild sweet stout but it does not leave a watered down impression. Great mild flavor, certainly not overpowering with it’s coffee flavors. Good creamy carbonation. Well mannerred and friendly, of course there is no alky taste at all. Very mild coffee bitterness builds a little on the back of the throat during the finish. Very nice! I was happy to try this mild alky ’beer’
North Country Raspberry Beret;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a pinkish salmon color with a medium sized foamy white head that faded and left a bit of lacing. The aroma was cracker, almost nut and faint vague berry. The flavor was surprisingly dry, a bit tart, cracker, a touch off with a vague berry note but not in a pleasant way. Medium length finish. Medium body. Not well done.
North Country Raspberry Beret;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;Sampled at North Country. Decent raspberry aroma, though a bit weak and acidy. Little in the way of hops. Hazy pink in color with no head. Light body with medium-high carbonation. Starts with nice raspberry flavor, but everything is up front. Not much depth to this one, and finishes watery with weak fruity tang and little hops. Flavor isn’t bad, but not one of the better raspberry beers I’ve had.
North Country Raspberry Beret;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;Draft. Slightly pink color to the amber body with an aroma that promises raspberries and not much else. Flavor is more like raspberry soda than beer, but it is pleasant enough. My wife thought this was great.
North Country Raspberry Beret;Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;North Country Brewing Company;Beatiful raspberry aroma and the appearance is an attractive pink cloud. Taste is not as sweet as the aroma but there are definatly raspberries in there. This is way above average for a fruit beer. Slight earthy bitterness of ale in the background. Almost but not quite tart. Medium mild carbonation. Finsih is like so many other fruit beers. Comes across like a flavored mild ale.
Trio Supporter Gimle;Skien, Norway;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Trio Bryggeri;"On tap at Gimle Pub, Skien. Poured way too cold, but of course that’s the way we want it, especially on a hot summer day. Clear, copper body, with a lasting, off-white head. Grainy and caramelish aroma and flavor. The flavor also has a suiting, but too intense sweetness from the start to the very end. Medium body. The beer is too sweet and grainy, but it is definately a good beer compared to the other beers from Trio. By the way, the color of the beer suits the pub and it’s customers ;-). (070713)"
Trio Supporter Bistro;Skien, Norway;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Trio Bryggeri;On tap at Park Bistro, Porsgrunn, one of three places where it is available. Clear, a bit pale golden, with a small, white head leaving nice lacings. Grainy aroma with some cooked vegetables (the taste of Trio beer) and a fruity hint. Grainy and lightly fruity flavor with some bitterness. Thin to medium body, and a finish with some fruityness and hops. Boring and refreshing. At least on a hot summer day as this was. (070713)
Wyre Piddle Piddle on the Pump;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;Cask@GBBF2007. Golden colour, small white head. Sweet fruits and redberries along with some appleish sourness. Flavour is quite much the same along with wooden and some slight grassy notes.
Wyre Piddle Piddle on the Pump;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;Cask at local club in good condition. Thought this was a bitter but it is a summer ale. Pale with white head. Thin body with some citrus hops. Not my cup of tea. Rerate: Tried this again and it was better with more flavour, an OK summer ale on a hot day.
Wyre Piddle Piddle on the Pump;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;Cask conditioned @ Humble Plumb, Soton. Full malt sweetness and slightly musty hops lead to a not overly drinkable light bitter but its not unpleasant.
Wyre Piddle Piddle on the Pump;Pershore, Worcestershire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wyre Piddle;Cask gravity at Bowl Inn, Charing. Not a terribly inspiring beer for number 3400, but hey. Gold colour with thin white head. Little bit hazy and a tad green appley and nettley. Bit off putting on aroma with a bit of rubber and then this nettle dominates the rest of the beer. Not my favourite.
Baird Strawberry Field Milk Stout;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Baird Brewing Co.;Pours a deep brown with medium tan highlites and a nice fluffy, tan head. Aroma is roasted malts, coffee, milk chocolate, and the faintest bit of strawberry. Medium body. Flavor is roasted, malty, cocoa, and a very faint strawberry flavor. A good stout, but where are the strawberries? Dissapointed in this, otherwise good, stout.
Baird Strawberry Field Milk Stout;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Baird Brewing Co.;My Bottom Line: A shy strawberry fruitiness hides within the milk sugar of this otherwise roasty and smooth Milk Stout. Not Baird’s best fruit experiment, but a success nonetheless in my book. Further Personal Perceptions: -Lasting head atop the brownish black. -Balance is achieved between the roasted maltiness, the earthy, leafy hops, and the barely tart fruitiness. -Maltiness and carbonation assure a comfortable session. -For some reason, I liked this one better than most of the group at the anniversary party. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Baird Strawberry Field Milk Stout;Numazu, Shizuoka, Japan;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Baird Brewing Co.;Dark brown color, light brown head. the is understated with faints hints of cocoa and strawberries.

Carolina 12th Anniversary Imperial Pilsener;Holly Springs, North Carolina, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Carolina Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Light copper color, very long lasting light tan head. Certainly has the appearance of a PA or IPA, not what I’m used to with pilseners. Really interesting hoppy flavor with a lot going on. There is some peppery spice, a soothing alcoholic burn, and it goes down really smooth. Better at the beginning of the glass when it’s colder, but still solid to the end. I’ll DEFINITELY be buying this one if/when it’s available in bottles.

I asked for a growler but they were out... Pours a thin, white frothy head with a partially clear, mildly carbonated yellow body. Great banana nose - not too sweet, great balance. I loved the flavour with a wheaty, yeasty base and an almost seed touch. Good balance. Great summer beer. I hope to see this for many more seasons and tourists in the years to come.

Cambridge Kriek du Cambridge;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Cambridge Brewing Company;Night of the Funk 2012. I was really looking forward to this one, but I was a bit disappointed. It did have a nice peppery and sour dark cherry aroma, but the flavor was very heavy on the acetic acid side.
Cambridge Kriek du Cambridge;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Cambridge Brewing Company;Big bright cherry, and sour yogurt parfait with a pleasant cocoa sweetness. Nice wet oak. Pleasant old cellar funk. Quite dry. Refreshing. Lotta fruit. Moderate sour cherried yogurt acidity. Real nice.
Cambridge Kriek du Cambridge;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Cambridge Brewing Company;Sampled at EBF. This is another beer that had my completely floored. Not sure of the vintage of this keg but the sour funk mixed with the fruit and barrel aging did wonders for this beer. Would love to try again.
Cambridge Kriek du Cambridge;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Cambridge Brewing Company;From a keg of the 2004 pouring at the Saturday afternoon session of EBF. Pours a hazed amber brown with a thin white head. Sweet old caramel with a touch of cherry. Acetone, with age noticeable right away, a bit nutty. Loads of acid, but a huge amount of oxidization fights it for prominence. Caramel, burning acid, very strong acid. Harsh but tasty. Wouldn’t want to drink a whole 750, but small sample amounts were good.
Cambridge Kriek du Cambridge;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Cambridge Brewing Company;Pinky orange with a ring of head a light haze. Sour Alka seltzer and fruit aromas. Cherry and raspberry. Oaks give a weighty vanilla too. In you face sour. Such delicate pink fruit with a real citric orange kick. This is so authentic and mouthwatering. Maybe my favourite American beer? Doesn’t say a word about how strong it is, totally quaffable yet so exciting.
Cambridge Kriek du Cambridge;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Cambridge Brewing Company;On-tap at EBF ’09. Holy wow. The most sour lambic I’ve ever had, I’ve been really impressed with the CBC in what I’ve had from them. I may have to go here more often...
Cambridge Kriek du Cambridge;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Cambridge Brewing Company;EBF Session 1. Aroma of cherries, alot of acetic acid, alot of earth/basement. Taste is full bodied for a lambic, and very assertive acetic acid, oak, and a good amount of funk. Alcohol very well hidden. I liked it, seemed to me like a neo-lambic.
Cambridge Kriek du Cambridge;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Cambridge Brewing Company;In short: An intensely acidic and somewhat dry beer with fruity flavours of gooseberries. How: Tap at Boston Extreme Beer Fest 2009. Multiple samples The look: Almost clear golden body with almost no head In long: Nose of “old stuff”. Where a real lambic provides a funky nose, this one proposes a musty nose. Body is pleasantly full with a dry feeling. Taste is intense. For a so-called Kriek there sure wasn’t much of regular cherries in the flavour. The dominant fruit flavour to me was gooseberries (aka ground cherries). Also dry orange peels, orange juice, pineapple juice. Very acidic. Dry sandy finish. No alcohol at all, I am stunned to realized that this is a big beer. An excellent beer but having heard great things about this beer I was hoping for more. I went back many times for re-retry thinking that maybe I missed something but the only thing I really missed at Extreme Beer Fest is an opportunity to prove that I can behave myself when I’m drunk.
Yukino Matsushima Tokubetsu Junmai Nama Chozo Sake;Kurokawa District, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Taiwagura Shuzo;Clear with a greenish/yellow tint. Rather thick, good legs, evenly spaced. Fruit, koji, and wood notes. Very tasty with a mix of the dry woody flavors of southern Japan and the lighter fruity flavors of the far north, lot’s of almond and melon with a peppery follow. A very good feel, slick and full. Man this is good. Another great example of what sake should taste like, not the rubbing alcohol cheap stuff that puts some people off sake. This makes me want to go back up north, even with the blizzards.
Yukino Matsushima Tokubetsu Junmai Nama Chozo Sake;Kurokawa District, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Taiwagura Shuzo;Bottle: Clear color, thick legs, nice and clear. The nose has a fairly thick koji note, light alcohol and a minerally dry apricot and peach note. No melon unfortunately. The flavor has a nice snappy rice note, lots of fresh koji and ripe fruit. Fairly dry, a bit light on umami for a namasake. Finishes minerally and dry. Still only light to moderate alcohol for a tokubetsu junmai namasake with a ginjo grade rice seimaibuai.
A1A Ale Works French Farmhouse Ale;Saint Augustine, Florida, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;A1A Ale Works (Craftworks);"Heavy aroma and flavors of coriander and all-spice.

Northumberland Newcastle Pride;Blyth, Northumberland, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;North Blyth (prev. Northumberland);Light copper coloured ale covered by a small off-white head.

Powerhouse 50 Shilling;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Scottish Ale;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;On tap. 50 Shilling poured the color of root beer with an aura of golden-red where ale met pint glass, with a decent head and mild lacing. The aroma was of the light smokiness of barbecued wood chips, bolstered by caramel malts. The flavor promoted the smokiness, nuts, and caramel, with brief notes of cinnamon and cloves. A good mild Scottish.
Powerhouse Cream Ale;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;Way too think for cream ale, and body has no creaminess to speak of at all. Pours yellow with small head that goes away without leaving any lacing, which is not good for cream ale. Average carbonation, taste is quite subdued.
Powerhouse Cream Ale;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;Tap - Brewery A light golden color. This had a creay head. due to being suerved with Nitro. The beer had a delcate malty aroms with a light balance of hops and malts the malts where light in flavor and the N2 added to the creaminess. I liked this good summer beer. A good fruity finish in the flavor.
Powerhouse Cream Ale;Puyallup, Washington, United States;Cream Ale;Powerhouse Restaurant & Brewery;On tap. The Cream Ale was magnificent. It smelled of biscuits and butter, with a wee bit of a floral scent. It poured a rich honey color. The head was solid, thick foam, which left thick lacing behind on the pint glass. The primary flavor reminded me of Cracker Jacks. Additional, more subdued, flavors included nuttiness, earthiness, flower petals. Highly recommended.

Florence Weasel;Herne Hill, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Florence Brew House;"August 21, 2013 - hand-pull cask at The George (Fleet Street) - as ""The George Weasel Beer"". Hazy brassy gold with a fairly small but long-lasting creamy straw-coloured bubbly head, mottled. Virtually no aroma - light grain, not particularly sweet, not nasty, just ... not much - maybe a bit floral. Taste is okay, inoffensive, quite floral and a little grassy/herbal - pungent, lightly grainy but again not particularly sweet; light alcohol. Average body, a bit chewy - some building astringency, weak carbonation, slightly longer than medium dry somewhat pungent grassy/herbal aftertaste. Decent, nothing special, a bit more bitterness than some."
Florence Weasel;Herne Hill, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Florence Brew House;Cask conditioned handpump George London 28/02/13. A blonde beer with an off-white head.

Florence Weasel;Herne Hill, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Florence Brew House;Cask conditioned at Banbury Beer Fest ’12. Cloudy gold with no head. Highly perfumed beer with quite a sour off note, there is bitterness but the sourness is quite dominating and off putting. Not very good unfortunately.
Florence Weasel;Herne Hill, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Florence Brew House;A Mes rate. Cask at the Florence. Slightly hazy golden colour with a reasonable white head and lace. Faint white wine note on the nose with a pleasant lick of hops underneath. A fairly straight forward bitter and maybe a little unimaginative in the mouth. But I’ve no real complaints overall. Decent earthy malt base with some light floral hoppage on top. Pleasant bitter finish with a hint of honey. Very easy to drink and in the time it’s taken me to think about it and type this in, I’ve pretty much dealt with my half. Decent but uninspiring.

Florence Weasel;Herne Hill, Greater London, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Florence Brew House;Draught at the eponymous. Hazy pour with noncommittal head. Smells of detergent, more specifically, those things you used to blow bubbles with. Taste similar at first, replaced with an over-strong bitterness, mellows out to a half-decent finish. Not a bad homebrew, but not a good beer.

The flavour is accented toward heatless chipotle with light pale malt balance. Not sure how they worked that - even with seeds and veins removed a chipotle ought to still be hot - but hey it’s nice summer quaffing rauchbier. I like the concept. Like Schlenkerla Hell. Well-balanced and beaucoup tasty.
Big Horse Gardener Choice;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Horse Brewing;Golden colour. Toasted apples and lots of alcohol. Very sweet flavour...lots of pear, some apple and no shortage of icing sugar. Very late alcohol makes itself apparent. Overall, yet another in a long line of cloying American Belgian strongs...guys, I like your brewery (one of the most underrated in the PNW) but Duvel and Moinette don’t taste like this.
Big Horse Gardener Choice;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Big Horse Brewing;"After climbing atop the Big Horse hill on a hot July afternoon, one would want very much to find a cold, smooth beer. If indeed their saison is on tap, you will be rewarded! Over the clear golden glass hangs a fruity aroma, like lychee fruit and banana. The light bodied beverage quickly washes through the mouth, making the beer easy to take. A pale malt beer attenuated well to only leave hints of sweetness, and candi sugar is suggested by the slight heat from the swallow; clove and ginger come to mind, but no hot- spice. A potent saison at 9%. WOW."

Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;Served on tap at the brewery. The body is crystal clear and amber colored with a scattering of white bubbles on the surface. The aroma is very malty with crisp hop aromas. There are some yeasty notes but it smells more like wort than beer. The hop flavor is stronger than the aroma but equally as crisp. The malt flavor is dominated by the hops. It has a medium body and decent drinkability.
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;Bravo! Bravo all around - hops, growler shipping and ultimately this beer! Growler arrived in great shape - well carbonated and just (seemingly) as fresh as straight out of the tap. Not familiar at all with Bravo hops, but wondering if they’re possibly the one used in Hop It. Very well done. I was a bit worried (stupid me) that I wouldn’t enjoy as much as either one of Vinnie’s more aggressive CA or Belgian styles. Why would I not trust this man? Grassy, superbly balanced, nice finish. mmmm
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;"On tap at Russian River. Clear golden color with a rapidly disappearing head, followed by lots of sticky lacing. Lightly sweet, floral, hoppy aroma with a subtle earthiness, but balanced by a sugary (not necessarily 100% malt-derived) sweetness. Rich sweet sugary flavors with a burst of juicy grapefruit hops and some earthy/leafy overtones. Super rich, sugary smooth palate with a fizzy champagne-like quality. Overall an extremely well-made and enjoyable brew. Reminds me more of a hoppy belgian-type beer than a straight-up ""IPA""."
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;Draft clear, light copper color with a lasting white head. Somewhat malty aroma with Belgian esters. Slight malt character with a yeasty spicyness. Oranges, bananas, grain of paradise. Finishes bitter and a bit fruity.
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;On tap at Russian River brewery in Santa Rosa, very light sparkling yellow color with some haze. Not much head development, only a fine film with some lace. Vinous aroma with some white wine influence, slight peppery spice and a noticeable floral hops kick. Weaker flavor though, nothing to rant about. Kind of sweet but the hops aren’t where they need to be for this brew. Finishes crisp and easy, a refresher to drink but not to philosophize about.
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;On tap at the Russian River Brewery. The beer pours gold with thin off white head. It has a mild aroma of faint spice, tartness and faint sweetness. The mild spiciness must be the Bravo hops. The taste starts mildly sweet with some tartness and a big punch of Bravo hop spice with the addition of floral and some pine hops. I can’t pin down the dominant Bravo hop character. It seems to be spice, mildly floral and pine. Interesting. I look forward to trying more of this variety. It is a tasty hop heavy Belgian style yeast ale.
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;Draft. Comperable to the other Russian River IPA’s as far as looks are concerned. The aroma brings the foreign Bravo hop right into your brain, however. Tasting, the Bravos have a slight celery, green quality, but they are still bitter and quite sharp in terms of their IBU’s. The beer is well-built to show the hops off, but leaves the palate clear and clean.
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;It is hard to make a hop like Bravo taste good, but this is as close as it gets. Nice spicy mildy phenolic nose with a bit of allspice and clove to counterbalance the somewhat harsh vegetative Bravo character. Delicate and inviting mouthfeel. Clean and hopforward finish.
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;Draft at the brewpub (6.74%). Aroma was very unusual - brett and angostura bitter came to mind. Dark golden color with a white head that ringed and left delicate lace tatters. Thin to medium body with mild carbonation. Lightly sweet herb flavor with complimentary bitter. Three of us tried it, and no one could put a finger on a name for the principal flavor. Let’s say floral/herby hop. Nice lingering bitter finish. Good stuff, if puzzling.
Russian River Bravo;Santa Rosa, California, United States;IPA;Russian River Brewing;From a growler thanks to general_gao. Gold colored body with a creamy white head. The aroma has a sweet note of oranges along with some grass and leather. There is also a toffee undertone. The taste has some grapefruit rind along with some Juicy Fruit gum. There was also a little bit of pine. Nicely done and relatively subtle.

Valley Brew Santas XMAS Morning Breakfast Stout;Stockton, California, United States;Stout;Valley Brewing Company;Bottle, 22oz. It pours a beautiful black body under a finger thick dense, tan head.

Hazy yellow coloured, medium sized lasting white head, sourish nose. The taste was slight malty and pleasant hoppy with mild notes of yeast. In comparison with few others slovenian brewpubs that I recently visited, this beer is quite tasty and enjoyable.
As Temno;Šentrupert, Slovenia;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Pivnica As - Pivovarna Robbas;Draught at the brewpub. Dark brown almost black coloured, small pale brown head that lasts not more than 2 seconds. The nose was very odd, sourish yeasty, vinager and some herbal liquer. The taste is similar too, with just a tiny notes of coffee and a bit stronger caramel notes. Acidic finish.
O'Brien Brown Ale;Ballarat, Australia;Brown Ale;O'Brien Brewing;330ml bottle from Plonk, Canberra.

Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, dry chocolatey finish. Quite OK.
O'Brien Brown Ale;Ballarat, Australia;Brown Ale;O'Brien Brewing;Pours pale brown with a small fading head. Nsoe shows bready and nutty malt along with soft raisin notes. Flavours include some butty and bready malt before transitioning to a non-descript mild sweetness followed by a slight metallic note. Very watery body.
O'Brien Brown Ale;Ballarat, Australia;Brown Ale;O'Brien Brewing;Produces up a deep tawny mahogany, seemingly still with no head. Nose is dominated by sweet, chocolate icecream and bitter dark chocolate with a hint of pepper. Light on the palate and a little gassy unforts as it was quite tasty. A lot of chocolate like the nose with an earthy and woody mid-palate and linger. Slight hint of diacetyl but this aids it. This overall is deadly sessionable. Swirling off the carbonation is highly recommended. A great gluten free ale! (33cL, BB 04/09/16, Gluten Free Living expo, PCEC)

Tin Mill Pilsner Beer;Hermann, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tin Mill Brewing Co.;An above average Pilsner. Light and golden with a nice balance between bready sweetness and light citrus finish. Tried for the first time on my first trip to the brewery in 2010.
Tin Mill Pilsner Beer;Hermann, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tin Mill Brewing Co.;Sampler at the brewpub. This was delicious, muddled, muted golden body. Aroma snaps with noble hops, herbally, fresh and green. Clean crisp with bread behind that. Great crisp body with a perfect above average carbonation to go along with the prickly hops. Flavor is similar to the aroma, with a great bitter kick. Finishes super easy. The wine server at the Three Saints winery tasting room told me she thought this beer was too bitter, so now you know. If I could get this fresh in a bottle, I would drink it all summer long.
Tin Mill Pilsner Beer;Hermann, Missouri, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Tin Mill Brewing Co.;Sample at the Hermann, MO beer fest.

A deep amber colored body. Oranges and bread crust came out of the smelling. I tasted oranges with some bread crust. There was also a little bit of soap in the finish. Decent, but not as well balanced as Skyscraper.

Minnestalgia Elderberry Honeywine;McGregor, Minnesota, United States;Mead;Minnestalgia Winery;Pale purple red color. Faint fruit aroma which I assume is elderberry. No detectable honey aroma.

Sweet malty aroma and flavour, lightly toasty toffee with just a hint of fruit. Light in body, but nicely flavored.
Great Northern Highlander Scottish Red;Whitefish, Montana, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Great Northern Brewing Company;Draft at the brewery. Was called Highlander Scotch Ale, though this may be recent. Like almost all of this brewery’s offerings, I find myself wishing they had used more hops. Nose is soft caramel, grain, malt, quite sweet. Flavor is more of the same, especially the grain, and mildly hoppy. Okay.

Blondie Wave;Santiago, Chile;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blondie;Golden, pale and turbid color. The head is average, and permanent enough. The aroma is bad, this smells to remedy, acid herbs. The flavor is astringent, there is well-known the hoppy (I doubt the good quality). It is very bitter, remembers the juice of grapefruit. It is like to take an extract of citric fruits with abundant candy. The body is very watery and slight. Probably, well frozen and being in the desert, return to take it.
Blondie Wave;Santiago, Chile;Pale Ale - American / APA;Blondie;Appearance: blond semi-turbid color. Medium head, of ivory color, low persistency. Aroma: Without self-identity. Acidity problems, typical of mediocre handcrafted Chilean beers. Slight fruity, of lemon, yellow grapefruits and pineapple. Floral and herbal hoppyness, but mainly sour. Flavor: Very sour. Lemon, grapefruit and pineapple touches. Reduced sourness in the finish, but persistent. Low dryness, similar to peel of lemon. Palate: Light body and watery texture. Low to medium carbonation. Bad beer.
TwoRows Vonnegut Maybock;Dallas, Texas, United States;Bock - Dunkler Bock;TwoRows Restaurant & Brewery;Tap at Brewpub. Pours like carbonated iced tea with cranberry-red highlights.

Grindleton Gradley Bitter;Clitheroe, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grindleton Brewhouse;Dartford Beer Fest. Greasy and bitter. A crude attempt at an old fashioned hoppy beer. The bitter burn of pellets. No fragrance. No finesse. Unbalanced. Hmmmm. OK, some fragrance emerges quite late. But too late to redeem the initial impression. The malt is watery and undistinguished, and the hops are simply bitter.

Aroma is sweet with crystal malts, honey, light hoppiness. Taste is a bit of wheat like character, followed by a mellow hoppiness, and a caramel sweetness.

Taste is highly sour, lightly sweet with apple, floral, and white wine notes. Not bad
Ace Joker Dry Hard Cider;Sebastopol, California, United States;Apple Cider;California Cider Company;"3grams carbs, 6.9% alcohol, gluten free? The only downside is the price is about $12 per 6-pack here in Lexington KY. Very delicious crisp cider that won't make you fat or give you diabetes plus it has a high alcohol content. There is no aroma of ""rotting fruit"" as one reviewer describes. If you are following the primal/paleo lifestyle (no gluten, low carbs) this is a godsend."

Ace Joker Dry Hard Cider;Sebastopol, California, United States;Apple Cider;California Cider Company;"12 ounce bottle, 7/28/19. Had this many years ago, pre-Ratebeer. I specifically remember sipping on these and thinking meh at a party in 2006. Clear gold, fizzy head fades instantly. Dry apple aroma. Taste is dry apples, apple skins. Thin. Simple but okay. And much closer to ""dry"" than most of the big cider makers get. Low sweetness. Low carb."
Ace Joker Dry Hard Cider;Sebastopol, California, United States;Apple Cider;California Cider Company;Poured from a bottle. Pale gold, bubbly, a lemon smell to accompany the apple, taste of a sour green apple, pucker up! Not as dry as I was expecting, but I like it. Medium bodied, carbonated, a higher abv than most.

Ace Joker Dry Hard Cider;Sebastopol, California, United States;Apple Cider;California Cider Company;Most people who are giving this cider such low reviews must be used to their cider being filled to the brim with sugar. But unless you like your cider to taste like wine-coolers, this is an awesome drink. Dry, crisp, refreshing, and strong, this is what ciders should taste like. If you're complaining about it on the internet, maybe go back to drinking smirnoff ice or redd's apple ale.
Ace Joker Dry Hard Cider;Sebastopol, California, United States;Apple Cider;California Cider Company;"Reviewed in 2010- Not really a big cider fan, but this one didn't let down. Not overly sweet, but at the same time not watered down. I prefer the darker ciders to this, as the clearer ones are usually too ""winey"" for me. This actually tastes like apple. I guess this this may be a better than average cider, as I've only sampled about a half-dozen."
Ace Joker Dry Hard Cider;Sebastopol, California, United States;Apple Cider;California Cider Company;So refreshing to find a true dry cider, Almost impossible to find Blackthorn in the USA anymore. A little sharp, but certainly drier than the stuff found in most supermarkets of late. I have to order it specially.Strongbow was acceptable until they withdrew the original product from the US in favour of the cloying sweetness of Strongbow Gold. Recommended for those who prefer a dry product

The least interesting beer I tried at the brewery.
Kirkwood Station Bronze Lager;Kirkwood, Missouri, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Kirkwood Station Brewing Company;Draft 12 oz’er at the brewpub.

Bios Hop & Mout Blond;Ertvelde, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;Rated from beer log during 2009 Belgium trip... Majestically golden to amber... Slightly tart, sweet aroma...

Bios Hop & Mout Blond;Ertvelde, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;33 cl. bottle @ ’t Waagstuk. BBF 18/03/2014. Sad pale golden very cheap pale lager look with only some soapy bubbles. Smell is soapy grains, some malts, slightly sweet, light grass. Taste is very reminiscent of a pale lager / pilsner, reminded me of something like Maes which is not bad considering the ABV I suppose. Lots of grains in the taste, metallic, some cardboard, plastic, malts, bitter grass finish, soapy grains. Body is bit high carb, light but not that much lighter than the standard BE pale lager / pilsner. I assume that they accomplished their goal of making a BE pilsner / pale lager @ 2 ABV that tastes like one at 4 ABV. Admirable in that way even if it is not per se something that I am really into.
Bios Hop & Mout Blond;Ertvelde, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;33cl bottle. sehr helles Gelb im Glas, Weißer, nicht sehr stabiler Schaum. Der Antrunk ist mild-weich, leicht wässrig. Zum Hauptteil hin wird das Bier leicht voller, jedoch hat es eine leichte, unterschwellige Süßstoffnote, die zum Gesamtbild nicht so gut passt. Eine angenehme und deutliche Herbe kommt hinzu, die dem Bier wieder Charakter verleiht. Der Nachgeschmack ist mittellang, angenehm fein-herb und wäre da nicht diese störende Süßstoffnote, dann wäre das Bier noch deutlich besser. --> Ein sehr leckeres, da angenehm herbes helles Tafelbier. 10/12/9/10

On the festival programme as ""Squirrell Board"" at 4.3%, but I assume it was really this beer. The few minutes I spent pondering what a ""Squirrel Board"" might be were more entertaining than the beer itself, which was a straight forward but unspectacular session bitter, with more emphasis on malt than hop. What hops there were were definitely Fuggle-y, with that earthy character, and the Liberty hops didn’t make much of an impression. Use more I’d say (or don’t bother with them at all)."

Thornbridge Under The Influence;Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thornbridge Brewery;Bottle, at London Shindig, August 2007. Another excellent production from Thornbridge. Difficult to categorise. Definitely in the Jaipur mould but perhaps a bit softer and drifting towards APA territory. Very grassy and herbaceous with some spicy, herbal touches and resinous hop backdrop and a smack of grapefruit. Very easy drinking and doesn’t flaunt the relatively high alcohol level at all. I’d love to try this from cask but I don’t suppose that’s ever going to happen.
Thornbridge Under The Influence;Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thornbridge Brewery;Bottle @ Chris_o shindig 2007. Clear light yellow color with a small, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white to white head. Aroma is moderate hoppy, flowers, perfume, moderate yeasty.

Thornbridge Under The Influence;Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thornbridge Brewery;Bottled. Yellow colour, big creamy white head. Aroma is earth, malts, hops and some fruits. Flavour is slight fruits, sweet hops, lots of nectar and mild honeyish hints lurking. A bit cookieish in the aftertaste.
Thornbridge Under The Influence;Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thornbridge Brewery;Bottle. Pours pale golden with a huge head. Nice, fruity hop aroma. Thoroughly bitter, grassy with some citrus. Crisp finish. A worship to the hops.

Thornbridge Under The Influence;Bakewell, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Thornbridge Brewery;A Mes rate: 50cl bottle at Chris O’s Shindig. Clean blonde colour with a very decent white head. Hoppy nose with some surprising dark character. Must be the malt I guess. It is possible it was still remnants of the Achel I had wiped up earlier. Flavour is excellent. A little hop fest that sent me all over the place. Grassy, bags of citrus, floral and a glorious bitter finish. All you could want from hops. Loads of character. Finish seems better each time I drink some. So clean in the palate. Certainly one of their best. Sure some will wonder what I am raving about but it really hit the spot for me.
Gubernija Respublikos Double Bock;Šiauliai, Lithuania;Bock - Doppelbock;Gubernija;Golden colored, lively carbonation with little white head. Fruity aroma with sweet sugar, paper and maybe even slight caramel, alcohol surprisingly fine covered. Medium to full bodied. Flavor is also fruity and sweet with again this mild caramel, aftertaste dries strongly with obvious alcohol. Not very much of a doppelbock for me, still decent brew.
Snake River A.K. Session;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Mild Ale;Snake River Brewing Co.;"I had this on tap last night at the local Old Chicago. It poured a clear dark amber brown with a small head of foam and had some decent lacing. The smell had some notes of biscuit, light caramel malt, and a slight hint of some hop bitterness. The taste had a nice biscuit malt flavour, not overly done, with caramel malt sweetness and very light bitterness in the background. A very nice flavourful Dark Mild..I had 4 20oz pints(served in the Guinness glasses); I wanted to get a pitcher after the first one but the server said..pitchers are only for domestics! LOL!! Light bodied but not too light, it had a medium light amount of carbonation which worked well. Drinkability? 3.9%abv, baby! Tasty and very easy to drink. I’ll be drinking more until it is gone."

The aroma is full of berries, including strawberry, and a rich caramel malt. The flavor is full of a mild nutty and toasted malt. Some light fruit in there too. Very toasty and easy to drink, also a nice full body. Very enjoyable.

The nose is sweet and toasty with a nice fresh caramel malt and clean subtle hops. Very well balanced and flavorful. Explosive umami in the flavor, ridiculously smooth body. Nice caramelly toasty finish. Awesome mild, this merits another pint or 4.
Snake River A.K. Session;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Mild Ale;Snake River Brewing Co.;Sampled on draught at the brewpub in Jackson, Wyoming. Pours a dark caramel amber brew with a creamy off-white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film with good lacing on glass edge.

Finish is slightly sweet apple/pear with a moderate bitter aftertaste.
Union Station Sandy Bottom IPA;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Union Station Brewery (John Harvards);Um...not an IPA. American or English. Barely an APA. Clean tasty beer for sure, but more of a slightly hoppy amber ale. Some nice fruity hops (not citrus) are in there. Almost minerally, like red wine. I like it, just doesn't score well as an IPA.
Union Station Sandy Bottom IPA;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Union Station Brewery (John Harvards);Draft at the brewpub. Like the burnt umber crayon when you were a kid. Quite hazy. Zero head whatsoever. Stark, blood orange, citric bitterness ... quite tart! (#4235, 8/25/2011)
Union Station Sandy Bottom IPA;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Union Station Brewery (John Harvards);Pours amber with a thin white head. Smells of bitter citrus, pepper. Tastes bitter and resiny with a citrussy finish.
Union Station Sandy Bottom IPA;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Union Station Brewery (John Harvards);Draft Pours a orange amber with a thin white head. Light lacing. Aroma is of light citrus and touches of malts, also has a musty feet smell. Has a good mouthfeel and a odd kick of bitters. Decent carbination. And a light to medium body. Not a powerful IPA but still decent.
Union Station Sandy Bottom IPA;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Union Station Brewery (John Harvards);This is possilbly another name for John Harvards Old Willy India Pale Ale. Very thin for an IPA, i’m sure it that alone would bother IPA lovers. Golden yellow with some kind of off tint. Not much on the malty hops. Bitter, slight taste of water and alcohol. Slight flowery scent. Kinda weak for an IPA.
Union Station Sandy Bottom IPA;Providence, Rhode Island, United States;IPA;Union Station Brewery (John Harvards);Poured brown with a slight orange hue. Slight white head that struggled for any retention before eventually surrendering. Nose was almost non-descipt with just some bits of citrus and a slight hop presence rising out. Slightly out of balance with the hops predominating over the malts. Needs mroe of a malt base to be a particularly note-worthy IPA. But still worth trying if you find yourself at Union Station. Malts came across as very subdued with more of an oaky character than anything else. Medium mouthfeel and just a tad thin. However, all-in-all it was still an easy drinking IPA.
Lido Specialais;Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lido Group;Bottle: 500 ml, at Piejuras Kempings (Ventspils). Price: 1,49 eur. ABV: 4,8%
Lido Specialais;Riga, Latvia;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Lido Group;Bottle from Rimi, Riga (strength 4.8%, not as per Rate Beer) Not seen this in bottles before, so grabbed in when I saw it and brought it back to share with friends in the UK. Malt and toast in the nose. Pours a brownish amber with a transient white head. In the mouth there is caramel, ginger and malts together with some hoppiness. Hops come through at the finish. A nice and drinkable Vienna Lager. At the time I was also drinking Sam Adams Boston Lager (don’t ask) and had difficulty telling between the two !

Front Street California Ale;Davenport, Iowa, United States;IPA;Front Street Brewery (IA);Draft at the brewpub. Poured a hazy, murky orange-light brown color. Head was thin, white, and left some decent lace behind. Aroma was of citrusy/resiny hops, caramel, honey, and cereal grain. Slightly sweet up front and medium bodied. Tasted of malty caramel with a biscuity accent and lingering grapefruity hops. Finished dry with mild to moderate hop bitterness. Not sure what they were shooting for on this one...either a hopped up APA or a mild IPA. Either way, it was pretty good.
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;EBF 2017. Pours a pretty clear golden with a small white head that leaves spotty lacing. Nose is of spruce, spruce and spruce hiding all the pils/lager character. Still fun, though. Taste is lightly sweet, lightly boozy and I’m not getting the spruce tips anymore but I’m sure they’re there. Moderately bitter. A bit ashy, too? Body is medium, carbonation moderate. Not transcending at all but still far from bad.
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;"on tap at extreme beer fest 2017, boston. unclear bright gold pour with a small white cap offering some retention and lacing. tingling junipers, sweet pils - muscat grape wine; astringent and tannic leaves and branches, not only tips, tons of spruce and resin trivially; some relatively clean fruity yeast action though. moderate carbonation, medium body - oily and kind of heavy; sweet sprucey finish. as bad as its name suggests. overly sprucey and sweet pils don’t particularly match."
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;Fresh aroma, mostly hops. But smells great. Pale yellow very clear. No head. Pine leads heavy with cedar finish pine sap present in finish. A bit thin.
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;Draft. Golden pour. Sweet spruceyvara flavor is grassy mossy earth. Not good at all.
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma consists of pine/spruce, honey, citrus, and grass. It’s a transparent golden-orange with a two finger white head that fades to a thick film. The flavor starts with with a quick dose of citrus and honey. The finish has moderate-heavy pine/spruce with light grass. It’s light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, it’s pretty tasty, but the spruce gets a little overbearing after awhile.
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;From notes. Finally getting around to adding beers from the Ypsi Summer Beerfest! Enjoyed on July 25. The pour is a nice clear golden color with some decent white head and a small amount of lacing. The aroma is heavy on pine resin and a little bitter booze on the end. I don’t really expect a lot from a pilsner, and the flavors of it are all that dominate. The flavor is just like it sounds. There is a lot of pine resin and spruce. It does seem like I’m drinking a tree. There is a little bit of a malt profile on the back end, but for the most part it’s big, piney, and very resin-based. The mouth feel is a little light, but there is a decent carbonation and a lingering bitter resin aftertaste.
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;Poured cloudy, color more of a hefe or pale than a pilz. Earthy mountain pine on the nose. The taste is crisp, resiny pine. Surprising beer. It has a little lemon on the front of the palate. Interesting beer, white head diminished pretty quick.
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;Light clear golden orange color. Aroma is big on spruce and quite nice. Taste is huge on spruce...wow. Like drinking a liquid forest. Nicely bitter. I like it.
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;"Tap @ Shorts: Had this on tap at the 10th Anniversary Party; it was specifically labeled as the ""Imperial"" version, even though the ABV seems to be matching what the ""non-imperial"" version released in bottles was. No idea if it’s actually a different beer or not. Should be, but who knows. Honestly, pulling from memory, it seems no different to me. Just intense spruce, pine, gin, & crazy bitterness with solvent & harsh almost chemical-like notes from the alcohol. Same as the previous bottles. Some sips start off okay but then they just crescendo into a world of hurt. Just a small shade or two above undrinkable for me... Pass."
Short's Imperial Spruce India Pilsner;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Pale Lager - India / Hoppy;Short's Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pour a hazy yellow with a white head. Lot of resin, piney hops in the aroma and taste with a big bitter finish. it is what it says it is.
Ballast Point Sour Wench - Blackberry;San Diego, California, United States;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Bottle from Alko. Deep amber in color. Nice oaky sourness, berries alot and some cherries. Blackberries, sourness, fruits and light malts. Drinks well, nice sourness and good body.
Ballast Point Sour Wench - Blackberry;San Diego, California, United States;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Nose very much with black current and some sour notes. Amber red with medium carbonation and almost no head. Taste fruity with same black current. Palate medium with sour and fruity notes.
Ballast Point Sour Wench - Blackberry;San Diego, California, United States;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Deep garnet red color, nearly translucent pour. White fine lacing remains longer than expected. More sour aroma & taste than blackberry aroma & taste. Blackberry arrives as it warms, so don't serve it too cold. Flavor goes toward dry quickly, with a fair amount of initial lactic sourness. I like this with a beet, bleu cheese, sugared walnut, spinach salad.
Ballast Point Sour Wench - Blackberry;San Diego, California, United States;Berliner Weisse - Flavored;Ballast Point Brewing Company (Constellation Brands);Pours a purplish color. One finger beige head, with a twinge of purple. Purple sediment. Aroma is salt water and berries. Smells like a Berliner. Taste is, salty and bitter. Blackberry doesn't really hurt or help the style. Doesn't really taste like blackberry, but it does have that bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Bitter. Almost prickly. Overall, I expected more. I'm disappointed. I wouldn't buy it again and I wouldn't recommend it.
Pug Mahons Porter;Billings, Montana, United States;Porter;Himmelberger Brewing Company;I was fortunate to discover this private label porter at the Pug Mahon’s Irish Pub in downtown Billings, Montana. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with a thick off-white head that slowly dissolves to a fine film and a spotty lacing. Aroma of milk chocolate, some light molasses, coffee and a touch of honey. Taste is smooth, creamy, very little carbonation with a milk chocolate and honey flavor. Finish is smooth, creamy with a light flowery taste. After the finish a lingering light chocolate stays until you order a second or third refill. One of the smoothest and lightest porters around.
Kronen Extra Beer;Offenburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brauwerk Baden Offenburg;Thanks to kevnic2008 for that one! Bottle looks very simple. Dont like that white glass bottles. Beer in the glass zippy, small head. Starts quite malty and dry, more and more bitter and metallically. Finish could be more balanced. Not my favourite.

Milton Argosy;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Milton Brewery;Cask gravity at Pembury Tavern. Amber colour with thin off white head. Diacetyl aroma. Buttery throughout. Some hop on finish. Good condition though. Shame about the diacetyl.
Milton Argosy;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Milton Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) Pembury Tavern, Hackney. Amber colour. As Mes says, the aroma is laden with diacetyl and doughy malt, which is not a good thing for a session bitter. Flavour is better, but still rather dull and malty. Without the aroma this would be a drinkable if unspectacular ordinary bitter. But the diacetyl drags the whole thing down into unpleasant territory, for me (a diacetyl hater) at least.
Milton Argosy;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Milton Brewery;A mes rate: Graviask at the Pembury Tavern. Big fan of Milton beers. This however was a big let down. Dusty diacetyl and very little else worth mentioning. Shame, I know they can do much better.
Hart of Preston Ice Maiden;Nelson, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oscars Brewery (prev Hart of Preston);Cask at the brewery in Preston. It must have been something wrong with this beer. Very flat. Nice color. Ok aroma. Malty and flowery. Taste was another mather...
Hart of Preston Ice Maiden;Nelson, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oscars Brewery (prev Hart of Preston);Aroma: A big whiff of coriander, floral hops, straw, and black pepper. Appearance: Pours a clear gold, with a white head. Taste: Coriander, lemon, and hops. Palate: Sweet at first, with a mellow bitter finish. Light body. Light carbonation. Overall: This was interesting. It tasted, and smelled more like a wheat beer... except with a slight hoppy kick. Very enjoyable.

Hart of Preston Ice Maiden;Nelson, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oscars Brewery (prev Hart of Preston);Cask at GBBF 2011, lured in by home town beer! It’s an interesting beer, with a light golden colour and a flowery, fruity but slightly sour nose. Taste was a bit confused though, with the balance between a chalky, sweetish Lanky bitter and a hoppy golden ale a bit confused and I wasn’t quite sure what it was trying to be.
Hart of Preston Ice Maiden;Nelson, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oscars Brewery (prev Hart of Preston);On tap at GBBF ’11. Dry golden beer. Very pleasant. Dry finish, which goes on and on.
Hart of Preston Ice Maiden;Nelson, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Oscars Brewery (prev Hart of Preston);Cask (GBBF2011, Wed) Lovely hoppy fruity golden ale, with a pleasant bitterness. Palate smooth and sweet. When I got to it, it was a little warmed up, I presume it’s a great refresher at a cool cellar temperatures.
Milton Corinthian;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milton Brewery;Cask handpull at Pembury Tavern. Orangey gold with lasting off white head. Orangey/tangeriney throughout. Very tangerine/satsuma, strong in alcohol compared with most bitters, good condition, good in mouth, drinkable and likeable. Modest hop on end. A bit like sucking on a square of Robertson’s tangerine jelly.
Milton Corinthian;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milton Brewery;A Mes rate: Cask at the Oakdale Arms. Golden colour. Hoppy aroma with some apple and tea. Flavour is much better with dusty hops and some spice and ginger. Light sweetness at the finish makes it moreish. Not bad.
Milton Corinthian;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Milton Brewery;Cask (handpump I think), Pembury Tavern, Hackney. Mid gold colour. Not much head. Pleasant, slightly flowery aroma with touches of spicy hop. Maybe some other spices too? The spicy notes come through more strongly in the flavour. Possibly ginger? Also orange marmalade.

Riddles Dry Cider;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Riddles Cider;What’s cider doing on rate *beer*? In summary - bacon scrumpy. Quite sharp and sour, which might frighten off someone unfamiliar with proper cider, but also sweet and tasty, so, for me, very drinkable. And that bacony finish is wonderful!
Riddles Dry Cider;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Apple Cider;Riddles Cider;A Mes rate: Plastic barrel at Chelmsford Beer Festival. Quite pale in colour. Lovely and sour but with some very juicy apples. Tasty dry finish. Sure this was pretty decent but my nose had stopped working at this point making a thorough rate pretty difficult.

Beselaars Heksenbier;Boezinge, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Leroy;<i> God knows what this one is a labelversion of…</i> Huge, yellowish head, leaving lacerings, whilst being fed by lively carbonaton from hazed golden beer with a greenish shine. Vegetable and pickles aroma, starfruit, citrus and too wet malts. Fruity, estery, but also oxydized malts. Sweet-sourish. Fruitaroma somehow like artificial strawberry aroma, but soured. Whiffs of vegetable frying oil. Rather uneasy equilibrium. Certain smooth MF, despite the spritzy carbonation. Strange beer, with weird connotations. If it’s an infection, it’s a benign one. If this is supposed to be as such, than it is a forced thing.

A washed out faintly soapy pale malt beer with a noticeable hop burn starting in the middle and growing into the finish. It’s a beer, but there’s little here that’s positive.

Wolaver's 10th Anniversary Farmhouse Ale;Middlebury, Vermont, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Otter Creek Brewing;"Found this ""on sale"" at the local bottle shop. Being a lover of saisons I couldn’t resist. This must be at least 3 years old, judging by the last couple of ratings entered. Lesson learned - do not try to age a saison. It actually poured a lovely amber, slightly cloudy with a majestic, tight head. The aroma was not offensive, but not necessarily saison like - oranges, lemon, toffee, caramel, oxidation. It’s medium bodied, The flavor was way off. Sharp, no yeast, caramel sweetness underneath, oxidation, metallic aftertaste. Drain Pour."

Lightning Old Tempest Ale;Poway, California, United States;Old Ale;Lightning Brewery;November 29th, 2014 - Old Tempestuous is a bold name for a beer, but Lightning is canning itself for this brew, pitting apex flavors against each other. When I hold the glass to the light the beer is refulgent and fiery, clear enough to show me the parking lot outside the window, but through a bright amber lens. The aroma is built on a burnt honey scent, and topped with burnt caramel, pineapple syrup and oxidized apple flesh. The flavor focuses more on a marshmallow sweetness and a mild alcohol burn, leading into sweet, dark bourbon notes. Overripe banana and syrupy, mashed maraschino cherries join with dried apricots to give the impression of an adult fruit cocktail, cascading and coating the tongue repeatedly. It’s a wild beer, and would have been best saved for last.
Lightning Old Tempest Ale;Poway, California, United States;Old Ale;Lightning Brewery;Bomber poured a clear orange amber with a lingering ring of amber foam. Aromas of caramel, fruitiness, brown sugar and light spice. Palate was light bodied and smooth.

Lightning Old Tempest Ale;Poway, California, United States;Old Ale;Lightning Brewery;Unique beer. Pours an orange color with a white head, And the most sediment I have ever seen in a non-home brewed beer. Don’t know if we just got the end of the barrel, but it is refreshing to see a beer-maker that is not afraid of sediment. Smells is great, lots of cherries. Almost like a lambic. So you would expect a big of taste, but actually, there isn’t a huge amount of flavor. Very malty, and some booziness, but mostly forgettable. Need to give the brewer credit though to trying something different. Had in the bottle. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Lightning Old Tempest Ale;Poway, California, United States;Old Ale;Lightning Brewery;Bottle. Pours a rather hazy amber color with almost no head and quite a few floaties in it. Nose seems a little sweet with a hint of citrus, actually, and reminds me a lot of a tripel. Taste is also slightly sweet and is exactly what you’d think of from the smell. Not a fan of this one.
Vikinga Negra;Lago Puelo, Argentina;Porter;Vikinga Cervecería Artesanal;"Appearance: very dark brown. Little head, of beige color and low persistency.

Tajano Pale Ale;El Monte, Chile;Pale Ale - American / APA;Tajano;Tasted as a sample at Malloco Oktoberfest, it was a big dissapointment. Clearly contaminated, bad taste, bitter and citric at the same time, and bad aroma &#40close to rotten eggs&#41. They have to be more careful in the process, otherwise, we’re not perceiving its real flavor. Maybe it’s not that bad, but as long as the results are like this, it has no chance to survive.

I am not capable of continuing drinking this beer. Probably try it in another opportunity.

Hazy pale yellow with zero head. I truly didn’t taste any of the strawberry or rhubarb and wouldn’t recommend this to anyone with taste buds. All wheat, somewhat spicy, no fruit...don’t bother.
Fort George Pie Beer (Strawberry/Rhubarb);Astoria, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fort George Brewery;"Very soft flavors, I was expecting maybe more spiciness, maybe along the lines of OSA, but this felt watery and bland. I don’t get much rhubarb, but then again, i’m not sure how much flavor it would impart no matter how much you add. The spicing was bland and the beer overall watery. Berries show through in the flavor, mild, but there. As far as a beer labeled ""pie"" this just didn’t cut it. I think Anchor OSA kinda pulls a pumpkin pie effect, this not so much of any pie flavor."

Appearance – Straw in color, Thin head and hazy. Flavor – This was like a good summer wheat beer but the fruit flavor was non existent. Did they forget the fruit or just add way too little? Palate – OK Mouthfeel, decent texture with a dry finish. Overall – This was billed as a fruit beer and did not give the fruit flavor and was a off light summer wheat ale instead. Was hoping to have a fruity beer for the day.

Fort George Cavatica Stout;Astoria, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Fort George Brewery;What I like best about Cavatica is that as an “imperial” stout it has an abv that doesn’t put you on your butt. 8.8 is just about perfect. In addition it’s a great tasting stout with a subtle burnt character and hints of licorice and chocolate. Minimal head. Made for sipping.

Fort George Vortex IPA;Astoria, Oregon, United States;IPA;Fort George Brewery;Sampled at the brewpub in Astoria. Oregon. I had a can of this with my Ratebeer friend Strykzone about five years ago but apparently neglected to rate it. This time we won't forget. Pours a cloudy orange with a thick off-white head. Nose of grapefruit. Full body. Resinous mouthfeel. There is a lot of flavors here but grapefruit is dominant. Finishes quite bitter. In spite of its apparent grapefruit dominance, there is a lot more here under that flavor and it blends perfectly even if I cannot easily identify it. This is a great tasting beer/

Fort George Vortex IPA;Astoria, Oregon, United States;IPA;Fort George Brewery;Pours into a nonic pint glass liquid gold with sparse evenly spaced bubbles and light head. Aroma is tame for a DIPA, slight pine sap aroma detected. Citrusy hoppy fruit is balanced nicely by the resiny IBU. Remarkably easy gulper, but has a bit of a kick. Great no frills IPA. Cheers Ft George.

Fort George XVIth Chapel;Astoria, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort George Brewery;On draught at 2013 Portland Fresh Hop Beer Fest. Fresh hop version with Simcoe hops. Amber golden color. Aroma is bubblegum, light yeast, and a hint of hops. Taste starts with Belgian yeast paired with resinous grassy hops, then adds a peppery spice component. Odd hybrid but seems to work.
Fort George XVIth Chapel;Astoria, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort George Brewery;"Pine and pepper, soft belgian yeast notes, some dough and caramel, bread, on the sweet side aroma wise. Amber orange pour, thin head. Flavors of dough, caramel, pepper and pine dank, mild belgian yeast notes. Peppery alcohol finish. Malty and yeasty, hops balance, but are still muted. Once again not working for me. ""Meh"", Jon, 2009."
Fort George XVIth Chapel;Astoria, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort George Brewery;On tap at brewery: Beautiful-looking beer -- bright gold, frothy white head, caked-on lace. Rich and smooth on the tongue. Extremely floral and spicy with hints of perfume. Malt flavors were filled with notes of sugar-coated flower petals and Belgian candi sugar. What I didn’t care for was the hot alcohol nip or the plant-stem-like bitterness in the aftertaste. Those two things didn’t ruin the beer for me, but I found them distracting while trying to enjoy all the good stuff going on in this beer.
Fort George XVIth Chapel;Astoria, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort George Brewery;Draft at Belmont. Listed on the menu here as a IIPA with Belgian yeast. Pours a lightly hazed darker honey golden with tight even head. First smell is mostly piney citrus hops, but going back, the esters from the yeast start to come out more to add a bin of clove and banana to mix in with big pine hops. Sticky medium mouthfeel with tight prickly carbonation. Sweet and quite Belgian like in flavor up front, fruity esters and hints of clove and other spices. Resinous mostly pine hop flavor that have a nice bittering bite on the end.
Fort George XVIth Chapel;Astoria, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Fort George Brewery;2010-06-28. Golden amber body with a small white head and lace. 3+ Busy aroma, spice, pepper? Mild malt, a lot going on but hard to tease apart. Flavour has a similar spice character but a healthy dose of alcohol moderates it, light fruity notes, light bitterness. Interesting melange of flavours dance on top of a pale malt base that has light biscuity hints. 7+ Smooth medium body is creamy on the palate and suits the beer perfectly. Interesting, perplexing. Huh. Numbers seem higher than I remember liking it, but I guess I did. On tap at Fort George, Astoria

Nose of big piny fruits. Brisk and assertive. Bold and grappling. Bitterness wrangles your taste buds like there’s no tomorrow. Monster beer. Nice, but completely unbalanced.

Laurelwood Imperial IPA IX;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Like you turned a corner and someone smacked you in the face with a pine tree, this packs one hell of a kick. Insane amounts of piney hops, sharp and bitter, this beer could cleanse the palate of the hottest hotwings. Pours beautiful gold, very clear, with a tall white head. I enjoy a bit more citrus flavors, but the pine hop lovers would cry in happiness.
Laurelwood Lucky 7 IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Picked up a growler of this on 6/3/09 at the NE 51st and Sandy Laurelwood. Colour... cloudy, apricot-amber. Nose...certainly hoppy and piney, as well as lightly citrusy. Palate... lightly carbonated with plenty of hops and pine up front and lots o’ malt(or so it seems) to balance it all out. A truly Northwest IPA. A very nice effort! Three cheers to Laurelwood!

Bit of farty yeast on aroma. It’s a bitter, decent caramel/fruit malt. Nice enough hop on the end. Not too keen on the yeasty aroma, but the rest of the beer is fine.
AllGates Smoking and They Banned It;Wigan, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wigan Brew House (prev AllGates);Cask (handpump) Pembury Tavern, Hackney. Bright golden amber colour. No head. Light malt aroma. Thicker malt in the flavour - more caramel. Not much hop presence. Rather sweet mouthfeel. Session bitter + sweet malt + low hops is usually a recipe for me disliking a beer. This one was no exception although I can’t say it was actually unpleasant.
AllGates Smoking and They Banned It;Wigan, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wigan Brew House (prev AllGates);A Sim rate (Cask at the Pembury Tavern): Novelty name, not sure I like it.

Blakemere Wheatear;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blakemere Brewery;Cask handpull at Pembury Tavern. Gold with disappearing white head. I assumed this was a wheat beer from the name. Bit of dull cereal on aroma. Thinnish condition, citrus and lemon flavours, tingling hop finish. Not much of a wheat beer if it is one. A bit thin, some decent citrus on end.
Blakemere Wheatear;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blakemere Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense) Pembury Tavern, Hackney. Clear gold colour. I initially assumed from the name that this was a wheat beer, but it seems that the monthly special range is bird-themed. That doesn’t mean it is not a wheat beer of course. In fact there was a rather cereal accented character to the aroma that I suppose could come from wheat. But the flavour seemed to be rather more corny. The mouthfeel was rather dull. I’m not convinced this was in perfect condition.
Blakemere Wheatear;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blakemere Brewery;A Sim rate (Cask at the Pembury Tavern): Cloudy dark golden colour. Smells a lot like cream cheese. Dairylea probably. Tastes like some sort of cleaning product. Really sharp and none too pleasant hops. Not too great.

McMenamins Spartesian Pale;Portland, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Draught, Spar CafeBeautiful cloudy, light golden-amber. Thin head. Quintessential APA appearance. Aroma of fresh fruit - papaya, orange, grapefruit. Fresh, fruity, peach-papaya fills the mouth. A little thin, though, on the malts and a touch too much carbonation. But a good effort for this new entrant to the McMenamin’s family.

Short's Aorta Ale;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Short's Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/2/2016. Pours hazy deep reddish/orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, raisin, plum, fig, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/roast, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops, fruity yeast, and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, raisin, plum, fig, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/roast, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, raisin, plum, fig, citrus rind, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness/roast, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops, fruity yeast, and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/sticky/resinous, and lightly slick balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden, a mild warmth lingering after the finish for 9.6%. Overall this is an awesome imperial red ale! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops, fruity yeast, and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV; despite the moderately strong bitterness and increasing resin/rindy dryness. Nicely juicy feeling on hops and yeast fruitiness. A really delicious offering."
Short's Aorta Ale;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Strong Ale - American;Short's Brewing Company;"Aromas are malty - bread, candy sugar, a bit of dried fruit, caramel; but also a good bitter backbone. A touch of fruitiness also, though I am having a hard time pinning down the fruit - mango, apricot? Color is an attractive reddish brown, not quite a ruby red, with a medium light tan head. Taste is a bit sweet, but with a fair amount of balancing bitterness. Medium body; texture a bit oily; carbonation is average; finish is fairly long, opening with candy sugar and fruit and ending in the bitterness.

Short's Good Feller Imperial IPA;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;"Tap @ Shorts: Muddy, almost brown-ish color with a beige tinted head survived as a chunky collar. Aroma of sticky caramel malt & dank, dripping hop oils, pine needles, & floral perfume notes. Notable crystal malt sweetness, offset by an abundance of stingy, bitter hops. Taste is equally bitter & sweet all at once; sweet toffee-like & crystal malts are met with a heavily floral, stinging hop bite. Tons of brash pine & super bitter grapefruit peels teeter with sweet & sticky malt undertones. I normally dislike darker malted D/IPAs, but this one was actually okay, mostly due to the super abrasive hop profile. I would imagine that with any appreciable age, this beer would falter big-time."

Short's Ginger in the Rye;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Short's Brewing Company;The ginger gives a delicate aroma in this beer. The flavor is ginger and not as marked as one might expect in terms of flavor, but it leaves, however, a slight spicy note in the finish. This is a beer that is flavored with many different flavors. Rye malt adds a crisp richness, somewhat along the of light rye bread.
Short's Ginger in the Rye;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Short's Brewing Company;From backlog. Draft at Old Chicago. Pours a cloudy pale orange color with a small head, leaves some lacing. Smells like a hefeweizen mixed with ginger. Taste is the same as the aroma but the ginger overpowers a bit. Decent beer but just not my thing, not a big ginger fan.
Short's Ginger in the Rye;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Short's Brewing Company;Small sample from bottle at Camping Ratebeer ’14. Aroma has quite some ginger, spices and some maltiness. Taste has ginger, spices, some cardboard, bit dry finish. Medium body and carbo.

Short's Ginger in the Rye;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Short's Brewing Company;Bottle: Muddy, orange-amber with some copper highlights. Dark hued for a hefeweizen. Nearly opaque, mild translucency at the edges. Even a straight pour produces a measly, thin white film on top... Again, atypical for the style. The nose comprises of LOTS of ginger with very apparent hefeweizen yeast. Typical notes of peppery clove, bubblegum, & banana esters are there, but play secondary to the ginger. Ginger is even more potent on the palate. Spicy, but not too abrasive thanks to the chunky balance of clove, white pepper, & yeast esters present. Some vague fruity sweetness in the aftertaste, hint of sugary sweetness with lingering clove & ginger. Decent mouth feel, chewy & pretty thick. Unique, but basically ginger root dropped into merely a decent hefeweizen. I don’t normally love ginger but I think it works somewhat well with the hefe yeast flavors. Just needs to be toned down a bit, maybe.
Short's Ginger in the Rye;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Short's Brewing Company;Pours a cloudy orange. Aroma and taste are largely ginger, slightly spicy and sweet.

Short's Black Licorice Lager;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;bottle. black with small head. i hate anise, but trying not to hold it against this beer. there’s an interesting chocolate mint flavor.
Short's Black Licorice Lager;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;"Bottle: Thanks, Jeff! Deep black body with hints if ruby & a chunky, big bubbled khaki head. Aroma is like a York Peppermint Patty or mint chocolate chip ice cream. Mint, chocolate, light roast, & mild vanilla. Taste contains a more dark fruit character; plum & red grape with a mild tartness. Light anise & a good mix of cocoa, mint, & vanilla. Faintly tart & lightly sweet finish... I really enjoy this stuff."
Short's Black Licorice Lager;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;The commercial description pretty much nails it...both in taste and on the nose. Not much more to be said, other than the mint comes through a bit stronger than the anise...but not to detract from the point of the brew. Good stuff IMO
Short's Black Licorice Lager;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;Pours a deep mahogany/black with about a finger of fizzy white head. Nose is straight up black licorice. Taste is of mint, licorice, a bit of sage. This beer is weird & I’m pretty sure the good people of Shorts were wasted when they dreamed it up. Very tart finish. Weird weird weird. It was worth the $1.99 I paid for the single bottle, but you’d be insane to grab a 6er IMO.
Short's Black Licorice Lager;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;29th August 2009 Opaque dark brown beer. Crisp palate with decent carbonation. Smooth dark malt with a very slight touch of yeasty marmite. The vanilla sweetness is there as is a little chocolate. The mint is subtle but adds coolness and smoothness. Licorice arrives at the back of the tongue near the finish. A very finely crafted and inventive dark lager. Joe Short is a true master brewer!
Short's Black Licorice Lager;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Other;Short's Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottling date.

Aromas of big chocolate, mint leaves, licorice, vanilla, molasses, roasted malt, biscuit, dark fruit, and a bit of bourbon. Nice and very interesting aromas as I would have expected. Taste of big chocolate, roasted malt, light coffee, licorice, bourbon, vanilla, biscuit, mint leaves, dark fruit, and some herbal spiciness. Some light licorice tartness on the finish; with some lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, mint, and licorice on the finish for a bit. Finish is fairly dry. Very nice overall balance of flavors, with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Very smooth to drink at 8%. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming on the finish. Overall this is a surprisingly nice and interesting black lager; that is very drinkable and balanced."

T - Starts out with a mix of sweet roasted chocolate malts with some mint and anise in the background. Through the middle, some vanilla and bourbon come through alongside some more mint and a touch of burnt malt. The finish is a mix of sweet roasted chocolate, anise, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon booze. M - Medium-plus bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth with a warming dry finish. D - Very drinkable. Really big an bold flavors, but they come together really nicely and taste balanced. I really like the vanilla been and anise combination.

Short's Imperial Carob Stout (2007);Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Short's Brewing Company;"Tap @ Shorts: Rebrewed for their anniversary. A shade away from pitch black, bubbly & beige head sits up above. Aroma is a nice blend of cocoa powder, toasted caramel, & a dense blend of really, really roasted malt. The taste is a super dry & super roasted malt kick. Honestly one of the driest & most heavily roasted malt profiles I’ve yet to taste in a stout. Char, unsweet cocoa dust, black coffee beans, ashy roast, & a huge, finishing bite of dry bitterness. I’m a fan of roasty stouts but even this one would be hard to drink in large quantities. Still pretty good, but just a touch of sweetness would go a long way to make this ""great""."
Short's Imperial Carob Stout (2007);Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Short's Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma consists of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, nuts, and a touch of vanilla.

Short's Imperial Carob Stout (2007);Bellaire, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Short's Brewing Company;750 ml bottle shared by alexsdad06- thanks again, Brad! 2007 vintage. Pours a deep brown with amber edges and a small beige ring. Notes of chocolate, soy, dark fruits (dates, figs), earth, and burnt toast. Light-medium bodied, with a fruity, savory mouthfeel and low carbonation. Has certainly lost body and carbonation over the years and picked up some of that soy character, but it’s still not a bad imperial stout.

Grey Parrot Honey Brown Lambic;Long Beach, Washington, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Grey Parrot Brewing;Styled in the Flemish Brown interpretation, but brewed by exposure to the wild yeasts of the Long Beach Peninsula. They’ve done a few of these, apparently, and were especially pleased with a recent red one (RedDiamond has a very glowing review of that one on BA). Burgundy-brown colour. Curranty, date-like, almost kvas-like aroma with flashes of toffee. Tart front, with bursts of wood amidst refreshing red currant, toffee, kvas, dates and lemon. The mouthfeel is a little slick, and a sweetness kicks in late, but overall this is a really quaffable, complex and quite frankly way off the wall brew.

Medium-bodied with a nice tart appeal.. warm, but not overly boozy.. good beer.

Rock Bottom Chicago Cuvee de Clarita;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;"Snifter. Dark brown body, minimal head. Served too cold! Leafy, viney hop aroma with an unripe raspberry bite to it; reminiscent of the raspberry bush not the sweet fruit. Big flavor - sweet caramelly brown ale base with a heavy JD barrel addition and tart raspberry. Somewhat dry finish with lots of wood char. Big flavors in this guy but they feel lumped together rather than well-blended. Perhaps a swing towards sweetness instead of tart/bitterness would have made the fruit and barrel work better together."
Rock Bottom Chicago Cuvee de Clarita;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Rock Bottom Chicago;Personal Milestone: Fruit Beer Rating #100 (out of 3579) !!!!! (Also - U.S.A. Rating #2222) And what a dandy it is. Looking nearly black in the snifter, the dark brown body is capped by a creamy brown head. (Wish it lingered longer!) It has an aroma of lightly tart raspberries blended with milk chocolate and lightly roasted, sweet malts. Very creamy, soothing mouthfeel. The malty sweetness is cut by the tart fruit in the flavor and a bit of vanilla is stirred into the mix. The finish is dry, fruity, and mildly sour. Very nice beer. Chicago folk - Get to the RB soon. This isn’t a big batch. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL

Butford Farm Perry - Medium (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Butford Farm Cider;A Mes rate. Cask at the Southampton. Yellow brown colour. Rather a lot of vinegar on the nose but it’s not unpleasant. Strange flavour. Definite red wine vinegar in the mouth along with some green tea, a little airfix glue and some lemon barley. Not much in the way of apples to speak of. Very odd stuff. Not great, but inoffensive.

Silverado India Pale Ale;St. Helena, California, United States;IPA;Silverado Brewing Co.;"Draft at the brewpub. 7.78% ABV Medium amber clor with a creamy off-white head. Strong fruity/floral hop aroma. Medium body; foamy carbonation. Fruity/floral hop pretty well hides the malt. Nice smooth bitter."
Silverado India Pale Ale;St. Helena, California, United States;IPA;Silverado Brewing Co.;A golden orange ale with a thin off white head. In aroma, light floral hops with biscuitty malt. In mouth, a light IPA with light floral hops, grapefruit notes, a bit oily, veering on a light APA. Boring. On tap at brewpub, August 17 2009.
Silverado India Pale Ale;St. Helena, California, United States;IPA;Silverado Brewing Co.;Drank it a the brewpub. A very drinkable IPA, light bodied, again good mouthfeel of citrus from the hops. A bit watery for my taste.
Silverado India Pale Ale;St. Helena, California, United States;IPA;Silverado Brewing Co.;At the brewery after a long day of rock climbing around Mt. St. Helena. Overall, a pretty lackluster IPA. Very hazy yellow-amber color. Light and fizzy white head. Aroma is difficult to pick up, only a bit of faint greenery noticeable. The flavor balance is pretty skewed. Almost seems like the malt base was way too strong. Decent bitterness, but fades quickly into a ginger-infused disappointing finish. Needs balance and a crisper palate. Good for quenching your thirst with a burger, however.
Silverado India Pale Ale;St. Helena, California, United States;IPA;Silverado Brewing Co.;Had on tap at the brewery as part of their 6 beer sampler. Found most to be weak and watery and this followed suit but it was probably my favorite of the bunch. Had a dark amber orange color with some light foamy head that quickly dissapated. Aroma is earthy piney hops. Flavor is also piney, slight citrus undertone, and some sweet malt, but mostly watery. Overall, just eh.
Squatters Respect Your Mother Organic Amber Ale;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Squatters Craft Beers (CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective);From Jan 2008 I got this bootle in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks John! It pours from12oz bottle a clear amber with a +2 finger head of foam that hardly shrinks during the entire session. The smell has notes of caramel malt and hops and is nice. The taste is unusual. I get some caramel malt, grain, and some hops midway through and it lingers on and makes for a hoppy and dry finish. I find it kind of light bodied and the carbonation is medium. It sure is easy enough to drink and interesting enough for me to take further sips but I'd like the aftertaste to last a bit longer and maybe a bit bigger of a malt profile would help. Still. A good brew and 1 that I'd drink again.

Banks DIH Milk Stout;Georgetown, Guyana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Banks DIH;275 ml, green bottle. I must say that I’ve never had a stout in green bottle before. dark colour. weird aroma, funk, skunk mix with chocolate powder and a degraded compost like note. tastes like something soured during fermentation (or milk that has stayed out in the sun all day), funky flavour, but there is a sweet chocolate note. mostly i’m at a loss to describe this beer but if it was all that i could find i could almost get used to it.
Banks DIH Milk Stout;Georgetown, Guyana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Banks DIH;Rumour in southern Guyana was that banks had discontinued production of milk stout, so Chris and i went on a hunt through Lethem for any bottles that might be remaining. We went from bottle store, to wholesaler, to restaurant and disco and had almost given up - no one had seen any for several months - when we found a last bottle at Danny’s (a beverage wholesaler). The bottle had been held back as it was only 3/4s full. We were given the bottle without charge. Though several months old, the contents were still unspoiled. Daark brown pour with small tan head. Has someone mentioned that this beer is sweet - malts and molasses? Fairly light bodied, which might be a saving grace. Perhaps not as sweet as Dragon. Hope Banks has further plans for a stout. A needful part of the product line of a distinguished Guyanese brewer.
Banks DIH Milk Stout;Georgetown, Guyana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Banks DIH;(12oz bottle) Courtesy of Oakes. Where did he find this? Pours a thin, quick dissipating beige head and a black body. Deep molasses aroma - and than more molasses added to seal the deal. So sweet... raw sugar, molasses, sugar syrup, bourbon and soya sauce. Just plain sweet. Somewhat thin texture considering the malt overload. Refreshingly different but perhaps that is due to the one-dimensional nature. Thanks Josh.
Banks DIH Milk Stout;Georgetown, Guyana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Banks DIH;0.275 l bottle at PBF. Black color. Sweet aroma with salty licorice, dark bread and dark sugar. Sweet flavor with licorice and coffee, suggesting liquid dark bread. Despite the sugary sweetness, this fairly pleasant beer.
Banks DIH Milk Stout;Georgetown, Guyana;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Banks DIH;Bottled at PBF., thanks Oakes for a new country! Really black, fair sized beige head. Chocolatey nose with a touch of wood. Sweet with firm generous body. Fruity with notes of plums, soy sauce and Tokaji Aszu. Despite notes of saccharine it stays fresh and refrains from becoming cloying like many trpoical stouts. Finishes moreish with low bitterness. Great stuff!

Full Sail Oatmeal Stout;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Full Sail Brewing Company;Poured from a 22 ounce bomber. Jet black with a thin tan head. The roasted malts are cocoa, burnt coffee, ashy. This is a good stout that leans more toward the dry roasty side then I would like. There is also a slight acidity that is distracting.

Full Sail Oatmeal Stout;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Full Sail Brewing Company;Tasting Room - This is extremely well done. Not terribly sweet, but extremely rich, with a creamy mouthfeel, that just oozes caramel and chocolate, with an ample amount of honey roasted peanuts, and some darker fruit flavors as well. The essence of an Oat Stout.
Full Sail Oatmeal Stout;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Full Sail Brewing Company;"On tap at the brewery in Hood River. The tap handle simply read ""Stout"" so I got clarification that it is a new oatmeal stout. Almost black colour. Rich milk chocolate aroma is complex with oats, nuts, figs, and Cuban cafe leche. Lightish body is silky, quaffable, yet still has enough sugar to round everything out...chocolate, more nuts, but less coffee than in the nose. The oats are subtle and surely pleasurable. Soft, sweet...this has great balance."

Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Dry Hop Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;Tap @ Shorts: Swampy brown, just like the original Part Deux, only there’s no head on this one at all. Boozy caramel & wood, the barrel aging seems much more present here. Bourbon, toffee, spicy vanillin, back-end with some ashy hops. Little bit of citrusy notes, but this isn’t as hoppy on the nose or palate as I’d expect from a dry hopped beer, barrel aged or not. It’s not bad, but it’s merely decent. Quite boozy for huge pours... It’s also not an IPA, rather a barley wine.

Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Dry Hop Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;Bottle…RBSG 2010… Pours murky and golden with a small, fat-bubbled, white head. Smells like it has some age on it – woody notes, dried apricot, dried plum and dried peach. Full-bodied with a milky mouthfeel and kicked-back carbonation. Nice caramel backbone, but lacks any real sweetness – just a solid leg for the big, bad, juicy citrus hops to stand on. Bitter, abrasive, dry finish.

Big Bang Apollo Space Crafted Ale;San Francisco, California, United States;Old Ale;Big Bang Brewery;"12oz bottle. Remembered this beer when going through my cap collection (neon yellow with crescent moon and ""APOLLO"". A very undistinctive beer with cool packaging. Only a touch above the macros."
Big Bang Apollo Space Crafted Ale;San Francisco, California, United States;Old Ale;Big Bang Brewery;Bottle. Pours brownish red with thin, off-white head. Aroma is grassy hops with some citric fruitiness. Flavor is kvass-like, flat, malty, with some honey flavors. Some muddy/earthy flavors in the aftertaste. Not bad, but not very drinkable, either.
Big Bang Apollo Space Crafted Ale;San Francisco, California, United States;Old Ale;Big Bang Brewery;Neat bottle. That’s why I bought it. Sorta old and musty tasting stale ale.
Flözlinger Hirschbräu Kirbebock;Zimmern, Baden-Württemberg, Germany;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Hirschbrauerei Flözlingen;on tap at the brewery. Usually on tap in autums. Kirbe is Kirchweih, a tradional celebration in Germany. Amber colour, larghe head. Very malty, hints of roasted malt and caramel. Despite the 6,6% ABV very moreish and drinkable. Lovelly!
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;Taster on tap at GTMW. Hazy orange amber red color. Thin ring of off-white head. Leaves decent thicker bits of lace. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of creamy crisp thicker texture to it, light slick, light drying in the finish. More grapefruit hop in the aroma than what I was expecting for an 8+% DIPA from 2006. A more fresh batch? It’s gotta be. Caramel taste. Moderate sweet. Light spiciness Lighter bitter. Some whiskey woodiness. Solid, tasty stuff to sip on. Malt forward, but a lot hoppier than expected for how old I should think it is. Impressive, in that way. Drinks like a decent mildly hoppy grapefruit barrel aged barleywine. I can deal with that.
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;Tap at Short’s. Pours very murky darkish orange color with a small head. Aroma has a bunch of oak-y bourbon in it. Some light citrus as well. Taste pretty hot and has a strong bourbon presence. Some oranges and grapefruit too. Too much bourbon and not hoppy enough.
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;On tap at the anniversary party. One of my bigger wants of the Anniversary ales. This one threw me a curve ball. Very strong. Huge whisky aroma and in the taste. Pretty much no grapefruit. One of my least favorite of the party.
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma consists of caramel, toffee, citrus, and faint grapefruit. It’s a mostly transparent amber with some grapefruit floaties. The flavor starts with caramel, toffee, and some citrus. The finish has moderate-heavy grapefruit, light bourbon, and vanilla. It’s medium bodied with minimal carbonation.
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;Tap @ Shorts: The anniversary ale I expected to like the most was the one I liked the least. Chunks of grapefruit floating in the beer (that was a nice touch). Murky brown, looks like a barley wine. Smells & tastes like one, too. Hot booze, anise, licorice, sticky caramel, with a light, generic fruit backing. Plenty of bourbon, wood, & barrel aging present... Grapefruit isn’t any more amplified than you’d get from typical American hops. This is the hottest & most bourbon forward of the anniversary ales, & it resembles an IPA in almost no way. It surprisingly gets a little more flavorful with warmth, but it also develops a mild solvent-y note that isn’t too great. Minor letdown.
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;Tasted 3/10/11. 12oz bottle. Mildly hazy honey amber hue. Bubbled tan head. Aromas of honey, grapefruit rind, with a touch of candy sugar. Full bodied with a bitter and tangy flavor. Definitely bitter and overtly grapefruit. There’s a subtle cake candy sweetness. An odd flavor but definitely overt in the grapefruit aspect. The barrel aging is noticeable but mild. Still Nice though.
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;Huge thanks to Brad for this bottle which I thought I’d never get to try. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a murky but bright orange that looks closer to caramel in the glass. There’s a small thin white head that clings to the edges as a small collar. The aroma is still massively fruity after all this time. Juicy, sweet grapefruits dominating. Maybe a little sugary sweetness and some orange zest. Oh, and a hefty bourbon aroma throughout. The taste is more bitter than the aroma suggested with the grapefruit evolving from sweet to a more pithy bitterness. The finish is boozy with the bourbon burning in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation and very slick. This one is a big bourbony DIPA that has a surprisingly big grapefruit presence still hanging on after 2+ years. Really enjoyed it.
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;12oz bottle. The grapefruit hits the nose at first... so far so good. As I bring the glass closer, I’m smacked in the face with an intense fusel alcohol presence... I can only assume that the barreling produced this. Trying to look past the booziness, I get toffee malt, wet wood, very mild resinous hops along the lines of pine resin. Pours a nondescript muddy dark orange/brown with a thin film atop. Grapefruit, sticky malt and barrel on the tongue. Muddy flavors really don’t blend well with each other. The alcohol is too distracting on the nose and the hops, malt and barrel really don’t mesh well. Full bodied, bordering on sticky with a boozy and dry finish. While I applaud Joe’s efforts and creativity, he took a big swing with this one and missed. Thanks Brian!
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;Bottle, sampled thanks to WeeHeavySD. Pours a hazy orange-amber with a white head. Rich aroma, of malt, citrus, hops, pine, and spice. Taste is sharp, of malt, grass, pine, wood, and grapefruit. Lingering sharpness. Odd, but very tasty.
Short's Anniversary Ale Part Deux Grapefruit Version;Bellaire, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Short's Brewing Company;12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy dark amber color with a small off white head. The aroma is sweetened grapefruit peel, caramel candy, and some alcohol. The flavor is more big grapefruit and citrus. It also has a large caramel malt component. Everything is thick, resiny, and smooth. The alcohol does show through with this, but doesn’t distract from the overall. I also believe that some of the original bitterness has disapeared and this now has some barleywine like qualities. This was still very enjoyable.
Freiberger Kellerbier;Freiberg, Saxony, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Freiberger Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);Draught at the Freiberger Schankhaus. Tart aroma of malt and yeast. Has a thicker consistency than their regular pils and also a stronger bitterness. Albeit the latter is rather astringent, bordering on alcoholic. Really nothing special.

Green Flash Saison Diego;San Diego, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Green Flash Brewing Company;This is a backlog rating from 2012 from a bottle, from notes. When I had this beer it was average to below average for the style and not something I wanted to have again or I just didn't get back to my notes because of my technology at the time, work and/or family. Words to describe this beer are toasted malts, citrus, florals, light funk.
Green Flash Saison Diego;San Diego, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Green Flash Brewing Company;I wasn't too impressed with this one. Pretty weak on flavor and appearance, but what little is there is clean and earthy. Grassy and wheat flavors, some mild citrus and fruit. More of a lighter summer beer. Not bad at all, just kind of bland, and on the other side of the spectrum from what I am used to from Green Flash.
Green Flash Saison Diego;San Diego, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Green Flash Brewing Company;Well I figured I'd grab up whatever Green Flash beers I can find before they're gone forever. This one is just OK thought. Hazy golden pour, very foamy. Nose is weird, indistinct graininess, faint indistinct spice. Flavor leans sweet with pineapple and banana. A little ginger at the finish, mild but lingering. Rounded almost slick mouthfeel, a bit grainy/sugary. Surprising really for the low ABV - maybe it would be better a little more attenuated.
Green Flash Saison Diego;San Diego, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Green Flash Brewing Company;Gezapft am Flughafen in San Diego. Klares Gold mit schönem und starken Schaum. Viel Kohlensäure. Antrunk leicht cremig. Aroma: Getreide, Erde, Heu, Frucht. Geschmack: Hauch von Ingwer, Zitrus, Brot, säuerlich.
Green Flash Saison Diego;San Diego, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Green Flash Brewing Company;2012 22 oz Bomber I expected to throw away this bottle, seeing that saisons are very delicate and that this is a session level abv (4.5%) beer. NOT Appearance: deep golden with a lovely thick, frothy off white head about an inch in height. this head has excellent retention (even after minutes there’s still a quarter inch there) and nice lacing rings are observed. Aroma: slight funk, bretty aroma is prevalent. phenolics and spices are present (something I couldn’t figure out turns out to be ginger, its subtle). no trans 2 nonenal oxidation is detected. just a light solventy thing going on in the background... Palate: body is medium and texture very creamy which follows the look of the foam. carbonation is lively and astringency very soft. The finish is short and very dry. A good trait in a saison. Taste: just slightly sour (not even quite tart). light wheat cereal malt flavors combine with orange and spices and mild hop bitterness. the ginger has almost disappeared. very mellow. Overall: wow. a 4.5% almost 5 year old beer has almost no aging elements (off flavors and/or aromas)??? it’s maybe mellowed to a point where some might find it uninteresting. but its subtle funkyness and soft spices make it a very enjoyable session beer.
Green Flash Saison Diego;San Diego, California, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Green Flash Brewing Company;BB backlog, Tap with Joe, Pours a vibrant and hazy orange with tiny head and lacing on the glass.

Growstown Steam Ale;Brunswick, Maine, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Growstown Brewing Company;(Draft @ Sarah’s in Wiscasset) Nuthin’ fancy but good...Pours caramel-amber with a small off-white head. Aroma of light bread and hints of caramel. Mouthfeel medium-light, lightly prickly. Flavor is light maltiness - some caramel and bread - with sort of cheesy yeast funk in the middle.

Big Buck Summer Citrus;Gaylord, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Big Buck Brewery;"On tap at the Gaylord, MI location. Described as a ""Sitrus Wheat,"" which I assume is an unintentional misspelling. Hazy yellow-orange body, thin off-white head. Grassy, citrusy, light aroma. Lemony, slightly tart body, almost tropical tasting, with bready, tangy wheat and yeast esters. I picked up some type of spicing, too, possibly grains of paradise. Strange and a bit over-the-top to be refreshing."

Broad Ripple Herr Kevins Alt Bier;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;Draft. Small off-whte with a long retention, transparent with a golden body, no visible carbonation, and a fair amount of lacing. The aroma was malty, mildly hoppy and bready. The flavor was malty, mildly hoppy, bready, and caramel. A smooth mouthfeel and a medium bodied beer. An easy to drink Altbier that does not set the world on fire IMO.
Broad Ripple Herr Kevins Alt Bier;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;This draft brew from a beer festival poured a medium sized head of foamy finely sized off-white colored bubbles that were and left behind a transparent uncarbonated light orange brown colored body and a very good lacing. The mild aroma was caramel malt. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The flavor contained notes of malt hops and mild caramel. A decent one but not one that I would consider buying again.
Broad Ripple Herr Kevins Alt Bier;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;Clear amber with a white head. Mild aroma is roasty nutty, with bready malts. Medium body. Decent flavor is mildly sweet caramel with a roasted malt drying finish. Not bad.
Broad Ripple Herr Kevins Alt Bier;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;Objectively speaking: More than honest alt on the malty side of the spectrum. I like: They went straight and focused on toastiness though they never reach the layered Dusseldorf levels. Interesting malt extraction, gently nutty which is a trait I enjoy and bready, but not overly so. Globally dry as well. I dislike: Not very hoppy, a leafy slice in the end would be welcome.
Broad Ripple Herr Kevins Alt Bier;Indianapolis, Indiana, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Broad Ripple Brewing Co.;tap at Mad Anthony Oktoberfest - Pours mostly clear copper with a thin white head.

Bready, nutty, sweet caramel malt and a crisp, dry, nutty and bitter finish. There’s no distinct hop flavor in this one, just the texture and bitterness to let you know they’re doing their job. Quite quaffable.

Dockside Railspur Black Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Dockside Brewing Co. (BC);Huge, overly sweet cherry aroma evokes cough syrup. Clear amber body is topped by a low tan head that recedes to a thin partial cover and slight ring. Sweet black cherry soda flavour with a slight wheat-like tartness notable in the finish. Medium body with fair carbonation. Could be crisper to offset the sweetness. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Dockside Railspur Black Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Dockside Brewing Co. (BC);Cherry red colour. The aroma is of rather candyish black cherry. Very cherry flavour, some oiliness on the palate. This actually lends it a hint of balance. Well, it’s candy - like Todd said almost cough syrupy, but OTOH it doesn’t have any of the typical Dockside off-notes so it’s going to rank as one of their better recent outings.
Dockside Railspur Black Cherry Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Dockside Brewing Co. (BC);(Draught) Pours a red body with a thick, creamy pink foamy head. Nose is very sweet. DAMN --- this is too goddamn sweet, its like drinking a whole bottle of cherry cough syrup.

Solid bready malts backing bears a certain biscuity side. Bright hops develops a fair bitterness, mostly leafy and floral, but their pairing with the rest offer earthy nuances that match the minerals nicely. Good balance between sweetness and hoppiness.

Hop Back Sella Necta;Downton, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hop Back Brewery;[i]Cask at The Wellington pubs 5th Beer Festival, Wellington, Herefordshire[/i] This is described as wheat beer style, mmmhhh I considered it to beer more of a traditional ESB but with a few quirks, I would be happy though if someone wished to edit and change it to a wheat beer. Poured amber in colour with a touch of haziness about it, Hops on the aroma but there was a slight sweet orange zest, maybe satsuma detected? Tasted very good, little bit odd maybe, not quite sure what they were trying to do with it, but very quaffable this was Grahams (Loz’s dad) favourite beer tried, he kept going back to it.
Falken Coop Bio Alkoholfrei Naturtrüb;Schaffhausen, Switzerland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Falken;I don’t find this beer anymore, so I will remember my sensation. The last time that I drank this beer was in the flat of one of my friend in Lausanne. It is not exceptional but it is drinkable, yellow and gold body, normal carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste is malty, a bit watery, some hop, acceptable.
Falken Coop Bio Alkoholfrei Naturtrüb;Schaffhausen, Switzerland;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Falken;bottle, labelled Coop Bio Bier alkoholfrei naturtrüb. Golden yellow, large head, cloudy.

Strubbe Middelkerkse Phros;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;Gekocht op 29-08-2018 in de chocoladewinkel Vereecke te Middelkerke (aan de tramhalte casino). En thuis geproefd op 22-12-2018. Phros is een helder amberkleurig biertje dat veel gebroken wit schuim produceert in een dik wollige structuur. Het blijft sterk aan het glas kleven maar zakt na een tijdje in elkaar tot er nog een dun laagje overblijft. Veel CO2 pareling te zien met grootte bellen. Het aroma van Phros is wat zurig, karamel zoet, wat peer en karamelmout. De smaak is vooral karamel zoet en karamel-moutig, wat bitterig en met hier nog een kleine pepertoets erbij. In de mond toont Phros een volle body, is hij niet droog, volmondig van textuur en normaal CO2 prikkelend. Een harmonieus biertje. De nasmaak vloeit wat uit en het bitterige blijft lang hangen, verder nog wat karamelmout, een pepertoetsje en een licht droogje. Een erg drinkbaar biertje waarvan goed te genieten valt.

Strubbe Middelkerkse Phros;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;330ml bottle @ the 5th Shrewsbury Bottle Share May 14, courtesy of blackhaddock. Strange spicy aroma, some orange liqueur / cointreau and coriander coming through. Slick alcohol mouthfeel, interesting taste and quite different to any Belgian beers I’ve had before.
Strubbe Middelkerkse Phros;Ichtegem, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Strubbe;This beer is produced for the small seaside town of Middelkerke, which is where I bought it last spring, in the chocolate shop opposite the main tram halt. Brown 33cl bottle with a front label showing the top half of a naked lady in the sea: very fetching. Best before 9th June 2012, I poured it slowly into a Corsendonk stemmed tulip in Oct 2011. No sediment appeared to have left the botle, it seeming to be stuck to the bottle base. A hazy, dull orangey golden brew sat in front of me, good, deep white head of foaming bubbles sat on top, rising through the cloudy body were rows of bubbles which replenished the head constantly during the tasting. Mixed bag of sweets in the smell, caramel, some sour fruity ones along with that Belgian knack of getting yeasty aromas into a beer without making it seem green and too young to drink. The taste was semi-sour, semi-bitter, an orange, hop combination with a peppery and coriander touch somewhere in the flavours. Reminded me of the seaside, I like Middelkerke and have stayed there twice on holiday, this beer sends me back. Interesting and different, well worth finding, it is sold not just in Middelkerke, but you’d have to search for it anywhere else.

Aroma of sourish malt with some caramel sweetness. Sourish-malty, dried-fruity flavor with hints of coriandery spiciness and ashes. Medium-bodied with pretty foamy, but smooth carbonation. A very mild, but quite smooth and actually quite drinkable brew.

Rathays Painted Lady Perry;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Rathays Cider;[i]Polypin at The Wellington pubs 5th Beer Festival, Wellington, Herefordshire[/i] This poured a silver colour but moving towards gold, some very slight haze. Lovely pear nose, first taste reminded me of biting into an overipe pear, simply gorgeous, even has that slightly sweet pear taste that you get from canned pears but the sort that are in their own juice! This was described as Medium, but I felt was moving towards Med-Sweet territory. I could have drunk this all afternoon glorious tasted very fresh. Later I bought a bottle of this from the local garden centre, it was nice but nowhere near as good as it was straight from the polypin.

The nose is fresh, bitter-sweet, juicy pear, earthy, barnyard funk and some fruity tang. The taste is so juicy upfront, sweet-sour, tart pear, some acidity, earth, light funk, pear skin, dried leaves, salted lemon vibe, wood with a dry, lingering juicy pear finish. Medium body and fine carbonation. Excellent balance. Good depth, yet remains very drinkable. One of the best perrys I have had to date.

Gwatkin Oldfield Perry;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);Cask, Jolly Butchers. My first Perry rate....Wow, this was certainly an assault on the senses. Hazy lemon squash like looks with no head. Aroma was big on vinegar and of course the anticiapted pear, with something weird lurking, maybe that glue in a pot you used to get when you were a kid ?! The flavour shattered any preconceptions about what its possible to create from a pear, and was an eye watering mixture of sweet and sour with some woody notes. Huge sourness in the finish. Quite an experience, and it seems like I’ve embarked on my Perry rating with a good one.
Gwatkin Oldfield Perry;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);Cask at Jolly Butchers. Pours dull, cloudy yellow with basically no head. Aroma hold faint pears, sweat, lots of vinegar, and must. Flavor has a quick, sweet beginning, then things get real. Very sour, with lots of vinegar, some tart fruit, faint funk, and a bit of salt. It’s weird, and I love it. Light to medium in body with sharp, tingly carbonation. The finish does have some fruity sweetness but it is mostly about the sourness. Absolutely lip-puckering, eye-squinting sour. Once I swallow the liquid I can get a lot more of the perry character, but while drinking this stuff my mouth and throat are all a flutter. Fantastic.
Gwatkin Oldfield Perry;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Gwatkin Cider (inc Abbey Dore Ales);A Mes rate. Cask at the Jolly Butchers. Murky lemon yellow. About as perry looking as a perry can be. Strange snout. Massive pears for sure but there is something odd I can put my finger on. It smells a little like ladies stockings. Hmm, well that explains why it’s really inviting then. There’s a slight musky mead-like character too. Yup I’m liking this so far. Crikey. That’s a real smack in the chops. Amazing tart pear flavour. Really good wood and lemony acidity with some intense but never overpowering sweet notes. This is full on stuff. Amazingly juicy. It storms around the palate bagging a wooden spoon on a saucepan and demanding to be attended to. The finish is truly epic. Amazing length. Christ on a bike. This is a big one. I don’t want it to finish. Luckily it seems like it’s not going to. Each sip just adds to the intensity of what is already in the mouth. Bloody brilliant perry.

I just added it for the statistics, and to complete my backlog! Im Glas steht ein kräftig goldgelbes Kristallweizen mit wenig CO2 und wenig Schaum, der sehr schnell komplett verschwindet. Der Geruch ist hopfig fruchtig. Im Antrunk finden sich ebenfalls fruchtig hopfige Töne wieder, sehr unweizig eigentlich. Die Mitte wird etwas säuerlich-zitroniger, die gute Fruchtnote entfaltet sich noch mehr. Der Abgang zeigt sich ebenfalls angenehm hopfig, leicht säuerlich nachhallend. Eigentlich bin ich nicht so der Freund von Kristallweizen, aber dieses hier hat mich wirklich überzeugt. Zwar kommt das Weizenaroma etwas kurz, aber die fruchtig-säuerlichen Hopfenaromen entschädigen!"

Alchemist Rapture (2007-2011);Stowe, Vermont, United States;IPA;The Alchemist;On tap at the Alchemist. Pours a slightly cloudy almost amber color with a fluffy white head that shows some resolve. Smells of earthy piney hops with traces of bready malt deep underneath. Taste is much the same earth and pine that are barley sweetened with a bready malt that struggles to show itself. Medium body and level of bubbles with a sticky resinous mouthfeel. Great IPA, if the Alchemist had opened at 3 I would have had more than one of these and not gotten filled up across the street with Hill Farmstead beers.
Alchemist Rapture (2007-2011);Stowe, Vermont, United States;IPA;The Alchemist;On tap at the brewpub in Waterbury, VT. Looks like it’s the first review in two years. I really enjoyed this, and it was a significant departure from the Holy Cow. Poured an almost red, and smelled almost caramel sweet. The malts were much more pronounced in this when compared to Holy Cow. That doesn’t mean that it’s not hoppy though. I really enjoyed this.

Rich and balanced. On tap at brewpub August 2 2009.

Nickel Brook Organic Lager;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;Got this in sample pack, I am torn on this one. Pours cloudy pale gold yellow, with ample head, good carbonation. I get a musty almost mildewy smell from this, not sure. First sip is a surprise and not in good way, I get sour as overwhelming taste. I don’t know, this I don’t like, as much as I want to.

Nickel Brook Organic Lager;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;Single can purchased from an LCBO in Ottawa, Ontario on 06/05/2012. Colour: Medium-dark orange with just slightly off-white head. Nose: Freshly chopped pecans and almonds, lightly toasted malts, bruleed caramel. Taste: Medium sweet, medium-light hops, medium-light sour. Like the other organics I have tasted, everything here tastes like it was freshly picked, roasted and poured into a glass for me. Delicious toasted malt is to die for, and it lingers forever on the finish.
Nickel Brook Organic Lager;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;Award winning USDA Organic, it says on the can.... well what do I care? I’m in Canada, where’s the Canadian certified organic jibberjab on the can!? Yet the body is a decent gold colour with a stormy presence of carbonation and a significantly large off-white head. The aroma is malt and yeast with just a faint hint of grass. The flavour is a lot of grassiness with a dry malt finish. Very watery mouthfeel. As far as I’ve discerned so far, the Euros do this organic stuff waaay better.
Nickel Brook Organic Lager;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;341ml bottle from an OCB sampler six-pack.

Nickel Brook Organic Lager;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;May 1 2012. 341ml bottle pours deep cloudy yellow with decent white bubbly head. Head settles to cap and leaves ok lacing. Appearance and aroma give negative impression. If there was more lasting carbonation might be better. Smells very sour off at first but settles down to acidic sweetness and grass. This tastes like apple cider! At least the palate is crisp and dry and I don’t find much of an aftertaste to it. And I say at least because that makes it drinkable. Once.
Nickel Brook Organic Lager;Burlington, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Nickel Brook Brewing Co.;Pale copper-golden colour. Tight white head.

As it warms the malts intensify a little bit but it’s still pretty light on the palate. A faint touch of herbal hoppiness and a touch of light bitterness. Warming really brings up a fairly pronounced bit of acetaldehyde that could be done without. A bit of tinniness on the finish as well. Meh.

Wye Valley Maynard's Secret;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Draught (Live & Let Live, Cambridge) Light orange, loose head.

Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;"Draught samples at BCTC VIP dinner on 7/20/07 Every body was in a flurry to get some of this before it was all gone and then we all started tasting it and were like, hmmm, ok, nevermind. They definitely went the Lindemans/Boon route, not the Cantillon/3F route. Which is too bad, though not surprising, since A) it’s made by Boon and B) 3 Philosophers isnt tart/sour at all. Big pinkish-amber head atop a blood cherry body that is minimally hazy. Retention is moderate, as is the lacing. Hugely artificial sweeteners in the nose, underattenuated, no real relation to lambic. Just another fruit beer concoction. To its credit, it’s not nearly as syrupy/sugary/fake as Lindemans Kriek, but it almost dosent matter. If you’ve had one of these ""lambics"" you’ve had em all. Vanilla, heavily sweet cherry soda and some cherry peel-like tanginess (but it’s fleeting). Sweet, cherry soda and cherry pie in the flavor, with a highly carbonated, fluffy body that belies, to some extent, the amount of syrupy sugars in this. Bits of tartness (nothing bordering sourness) are noted on the finish, as in the aroma, but there’s nothing here resembling a lambic, for the most part. I actually remember Boon Kriek being more authentic than this. Go figure."
Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;Draft BCTC 2007. This beer was so nice. Fruity cherry aroma. Cherry malty flavor. Tart tasting. Finish is fruity and tart. Smooth palate. Easily drinkable. Medium bodied. Very nice beer. Would definitely drink again.
Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;Easily the best beer Ommegang has brewed so far. The cherries are fantastic, the palate is smooth and the tartness was right on the money. If they don’t bottle this, something is seriously wrong.
Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;Via pitcher, at BCTC VIP dinner 2007. Red, with a thin pink head. Cherry aroma, but unfortunately more sweet than tart. Flavor was a bit more tart than the aroma, but the sweetness still dominated. A fairly simple beer that did not live up the expectations I set when I saw it listed on the menu.
Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;"Pitcher, BCTC 2007. Pours a clear, dark maroon color; lightest pink head with decent retention at the perimeter. Dense, cherry tart and sweet red fruit (strawberry) aroma. Very sweet, cherry and strawberry sugar goodness, but not much else; sugar and red fruits. Medium, red fruit finish. Paired well with the ice-cream / cherry pastry desert at BCTC."
Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;sampled at BCTC at the vip dinner. I initially didnt even get a glass of this and had to frantically run around and look for some. Thus was the vip dinner. Oh well. I found some and was abruptly dissappointed. Pours a medium pinkish red with a little head that fades fast. Nose is sweet cherries, but nothing funky or tart. Flavor is sweet and a bit cloying at times. Not quite as over the top sweet as Lindemanns, but bordering on that. Heard a rumour (and saw a bunch of kegs) indicating that this may just been Boon Kriek. Hmmmm....
Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;[BCTC ’07] - served at the VIP dinner - clear pinkish beer with a fast-fading white head - very sweet, nearly artificial cherry aroma, with notes of vanilla, and not much else (as aeneas notes, it almost smells like cherry soda) - sweet, sugary flavor, with dominant cherry (although quite natural, not artificial like the aroma seems to suggest) - no funkiness or earthy complexity (tastes filtered, even) - a tiny bit of nearly acidic tartness and fruit skins come into play, but never really step up and balance the sweetness - one-dimensional, and, yes, quite like lindemans.
Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;Aroma reminded me of cherry-cream soda... very forward cherry character, kinda sweet. No real funk or spontaneous ferm character. Poured a nice cherry red color with a thin white head. Again, more reminescent of soda. Flavor was very cherry forward with a solid sweetness in the finish, some acidity cleaned the palate at the finish, but was too low to really follow the sweet cherry flavor. Mouthfeel was full despite the low-moderate carbonation, texture again reminded me of soda. Overall, meh, tried it at BCTC, am glad I did, it went well with the desert of puff pastries, ice cream and strawberries, but simplistic and uninspired as a stand-alone beer.
Ommegang Kriek;Lembeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij F. Boon;[BCTC 07] Poured a hazy, ruby red color with a small, pinkish white head, that left very light lacing on the glass. Musty aroma of cherry, a bit of vanilla, and a bit of apple as well. Taste was cloying sweet, cherries, a faint tartness, but not nearly enough. Reminded me of a Lindemans Kriek.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;Barrel event at Iron Hill on 1/21. Aroma of good sour funk, grape and a hint of yeast. Pours bright blonde and thick. Taste is definite funk, grass, and sour apple with a nice herbal aftertaste. Not too tart and nice and complex. Terrific sour ale.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;Draft at the 2012 Barrels bourbon and bugs event. Poured a solid bodied hazy yellow with a smaller foamy bright white head. Aroma of lemons, Brett, oaky and band aids. Fuller bodied with soft carbonation and a dry finish. Flavor is t quite as good as the aroma with notes of wood, lemon rinds, band aid and Brett. Pretty good but not great.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;Tap at Maple Shade, Bourbon, Barrels, and Bugs. Pours out a cloudy straw/golden color with a small off white head. Aroma is of oak, brett, funk and light earth. Taste is complex, with some nice tartness, light oaky notes, citrus, lemon, barnyard and light bandaid. All of it comes together very well. Solid sour.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;Tap at BCWC 2010. This is the Iron Hill Maple Shade version- which was ok, but I have had better versions and worse versions at BCTC in the past, but no notes I don’t think. This one is incredibly hazy golden with a very thick tight head that dissipates to form those small independent cloud/iceberg-like head formations that last the whole way through. Aroma is funky, bretted out- lactic and sour notes, earth, bready biscuit malts and gummy wheat malts light pepper spices. Flavor is earthy, doughy leather and earth funks, along with some woody, earth and oak- with a citrus and fruity funkiness as it warms- gets light pineapple and some wild horsey notes- with a yeasty doughy mouthfeel- gets a bit messy overall, but still not bad.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;On tap at the West Chester location. Poured a medium and cloudy golden color with a small sized head. Aromas of citrus, fruity, earthy, barnyard, musty, brett, and bananas. Tastes of lemons, brett, oaky, funky, and apples. Lightly tart and refreshing.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;On tap at IH West Chester for the 08 MUG Club night. Pours a hazy golden/orange with a medium off white head that left some lacing. Aroma of brett, cereal grains, grapes, citrus notes, fruity, barnyard, touch of vanilla and floral. Flavor was a nice match of the same with some cereal/malty notes present, but the brett was there and complimented this golden ale nicely. Really nice Belgian Golden ale that showcased what brett can really add to a brew! Well done.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;(BCTC, draft) Cloudy lemon-yellow body with minimal white head. Aroma is medium sweet, sour/lemon, some funk. Taste is medium sweet, lemon, dusky, some sourness. Acidic medium body, light creaminess.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;Tap at BCTC. This one didn’t do it for me. Funkhouse aroma is light but defined. Little complexity. A touch of grape in the flavor quickly degrades into toasted malts and then ugly, acrid mud. The finish is so bad that it completely destroys an otherwise fine beer. I guess this is the kind of beer you have to chug in order to minimize exposure to the finish :)
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;Carolina Crew Gathering Greenville, NC. Thanks to Ryan for sharing this! Hazy pale color with a fizzy white head. Sour grape aroma. Very acidic up front with slight buttery finish.
Iron Hill Heywood;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Iron Hill West Chester;Shared by frumptydumpty. I believe it was a year old handbottle. Pours a pale hazy brew with a thin white head. The nose is tart and acidic, sour grapes, vinous, phenolic. The flavor is at first very tart and sour but then develops a very distinct popcorn jellybean flavor. Tart and acidic mouthfeel.
Bernard Lebrec Cidre Brut;Englesqueville-La-Percée, France;Apple Cider;Bernard Lebrec;Apple, musty aroma. Clear-golden in color with a few bubbles for head. Moderately sweet with a slightly dry finish. Notes: Stumbled upon the cidery while visiting Normandy. Also make great calvados and liquer!
Bernard Lebrec Cidre Brut;Englesqueville-La-Percée, France;Apple Cider;Bernard Lebrec;Had a try at the cidery, and bought a 33 cl bottle, even though I preferred their [i]Pommeau[/i]. Hazy deep golden, plain and non-complex apple aroma, good balance.
Jackie O's Chomolungma;Athens, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Jackie O's Pub & Brewery;Nutty dark malt scent. Pours black body with creamy tan lace diminishing. Taste is medium sweet to bitter with nut and licorice notes. Palate is medium bodied sticky feel soft to average carbonation and a long bitter finish. Probably my favourite of their beer which initially I sample as a homage to the later great JBKO. Second sip confirms my opinion.
Jackie O's Chomolungma;Athens, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Jackie O's Pub & Brewery;Keg at Brewdog Reading - my first Ohio beer. Brown with a thin beige head. Rather too fizzy. Fake chocolate and coffee aroma. Touch of vomit. Burnt rum barrels. Maple syrup, walnut and pecan come through in a very dry finish. Got slightly better as I drank more, but not enough. Decent mouthfeel but I don't like the flavour - the hint of vomit lasts to the end. Very disappointing.
Jackie O's Chomolungma;Athens, Ohio, United States;Brown Ale;Jackie O's Pub & Brewery;Keg at BrewDog Shepherds Bush. Looks like cola. Aroma is kind of reminiscent of doctor pepper or root beer. Not bad, but surprisingly fit.

Pours a richly golden orange hue, fiery sunset body and edges with gentle haze, a frothy offwhite head atop dies to a filmy ring, laces ok. Nice colors. Aromas are flaked wheat and citrus, firm dry bitter florals, grass. Some grapefruit, lemons, hitting some dry hoppy elements. Initial is lighter end of the fold giving some firm bitterness, lemons and florals give good life. Grapefruit, flowers, a touch dank. Middle is a touch sweet but the hop melange grows firmly. Dry and bitter, grapefruit, dandelions and florals, grass as a firm bitterness stays into the backend and finish. Pretty solid, some flaked wheat, bready malts keep the beer honest but the hop profile really slowly builds into a firmly bitter beer that’s still quite drinkable en masse. Good flavors and fuzzy peach, some melon, and richer grapefruit presence really comes along.
Jackie O's Sun Village;Athens, Ohio, United States;IPA - White;Jackie O's Pub & Brewery;Sample on tap at the brewpub. Mildly hazy amber color. Little white head, faded to minimal after a bit.

Aroma of sweet bread and toffee. Tastes are sweet malt grains, nutty, earthy. Straightforward, but good balance. Finishes light herbal bitter.
Black Box Plumbers Crack Ale;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Unassuming 4.5% beer with excellent flavor and superior overall aesthetics. I am not one to wax poetic about the smell of freshly mown grass or whatever. If you appreciate flavor with relatively low ABV, this one rules.
Black Box Plumbers Crack Ale;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Sample at Smiling Skull as part of Ohio Brew Week. Pours a clear copper-amber color with a medium thick foamy white head that dissipates slowly. Small patches of lace. Aroma of malt, caramel and slight hops. Light-bodied with flavors of grainy malt, caramel and mild hops. The finish is sweet with a short malty average. About what you would expect for a gimmicky beer like this.
Black Box Plumbers Crack Ale;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Draft. Poureed clear dark amber color with an average fizzy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted malt and hop aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Flavor was moderate bittersweet flavor with an average bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good brew.
Black Box Plumbers Crack Ale;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Tasted this at the 2012 Brew Week in Athens, Ohio. Pours a clear copper with a small white head. Hops aroma with a hint of hay or wheat. Medium bitter with a hint of sweet. Light body with a nice clean but slightly bitter finish. Tasty for an amber ale but nothing special.
Black Box Plumbers Crack Ale;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Refrigerated bottle poured into a shaker. Pours dark amber with small off-white head. Medium body medium carbonation, and slightly slick texture. Taste is slightly toasted caramel malt and finishes slightly minty hops.
Black Box Plumbers Crack Ale;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;Light grain aroma. Pours a reddish-amber, with a thin white head. A bit more bitterness then I usually expect in a Kolsch, without the usual crispness. This comes across more of an amber ale. A drinkable beer, nothing out of the ordinary.
Black Box Plumbers Crack Ale;Westlake, Ohio, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Black Box Brewing Company;July 17-19, 2008: Plumber’s Crack has an earthy, biscuit-like aroma with green, leafy hops, and a toasted toffee maltiness in the flavor. It is also slightly nutty (pecan maybe). This medium-bodied beer is smooth, copper-colored, clear, and has a creamy off-white head. Not bad... Draught sample at Skipper’s Bar & Grille in Athens, Ohio during Ohio Brew Week 2008. Rating #2 for this beer.
Mt. Hood Bavarian Hefeweizen;Government Camp, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mt. Hood Brewing;Hazy dark straw colour. Fruity, slightly wheaty aroma. Dry grainy character with fresh lemony notes and plenty of clovy spice.
Mt. Hood Beyond the Pale;Government Camp, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mt. Hood Brewing;Golden-amber colour. Hazy. Very fruity hop nose starts with bright tangerine & pommelo, descending into darker cherries and golden plums. Very bitter. Some nice melon and dark fruit...maybe even wood. The finish picks up a little crystal malt. Strap on your helmets, this is really assertive.
Pizza Port Brain Shark Pale Ale;Solana Beach, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Off the cask at Solana Beach. Amber pour with a thick, creamy head courtesy of the cask. Musty hops with citrus and pine notes. Creamy hop taste with a strong malt profile. Caramel, the dry orange, and grassy malt in the finish.

Captured by Porches Hefeweizen;St Helens, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;Very thick clouds. Peachy colour. Rich fruits (peach, pear, plum), light spice, med. bubblegum and lots of sweet malt. The taste, however, is a 180 degree shift from that gorgeous aroma. It has a strong burnt plastic overtone and a harsh astringency. Wow. This was shaping up to be a real beauty of a hefe but there’s a yeast issue here.
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;A good IPA that I actually enjoyed and drank quite quickly it was that good.
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;Another Captured by Porches beer..back from the dead. Brewed at Barley Sprout , Gresham Bought at Lifesource natural grocer in Salem OR $3.99..500ml bottle. Strangely attractive amber coloured pour.quite hazy with a large handsome creamy/rocky creme coloured head. Same weird aroma as the ESB..vegetal..boiled broccolli..sigh Taste is a little better but its pretty muddled bitter, vegetable, tea..all over the place..muddy..like an Organic beer from the late 90s. Palate is medium..low carbonation and a little sticky in the end. Another bad beer..why come back after the years?
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;(Bottle) A little different in that the malt taste is *very* sweet (although the flavor is good), but it has a super long drawn-out, lingering bitter aftertaste. I don’t think it’s bad but that bitterness just doesn’t work because A) it doesn’t balance the sweetness at all, and B) for an hour afterwards your mouth feels like you’ve been chewing on orange peels.
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;Pours orange-amber with a small white head. Pleasant herbal, slightly spicy hop aroma brings to mind summit hops. Flavor is at first spicy and bitter, quickly followed by plenty of malt, ending with a lingering bitterness. Flavor comes and goes quickly, and the finish is a bit watery but retains some mildly caustic bitterness. The aroma and taste, while clearly sticking to the NW IPA style, are pretty unique. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;Big old swingtop. Pours a clear copper color with a large white head. A nose of lemons and biscuit. The flavor is marmalade, some tropical fruits, certainly papaya, lemons, low bitterness, grains. OK. Nothing standouts but no major flaws. Finishes bitter and tropical.
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;Big swing-top bottle, have had a few times. Decent single IPA, just a bit on the wet malty side. Great little brew company!
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;Bomber. Citrus and mild bitterness throughout. Light malty caramel in the background. Finish is oily and sour.
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;Shared from a big swing-top bottle into a mini schooner glass. Thanks Greg and Joe. I had high hopes, but this was a bomb unfortunately. Definitely stale and probably infected. It poured a hazy golden light amber, persistent white foam, lots of suspended floaties. Bad, bitter, vegetal taste, like broccoli stew. Too bad. I’ve heard their stuff is great fresh from the bus with a slice of pizza at the pumpkin patch on the island, so I’d definitely give ’em another try.
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;One liter swingtop. I bought this a while ago, should have drank it fresh. Oh well, such is life. Massive, creamy head on a warm amber medium body. Fruit, caramel, grass, citrus, and alcohol in the nose. Maybe just a touch catty? Moderate carbonation. Lots of flavor, citrus, fruit, toffee, fading into pine.
Captured by Porches Invasive Species IPA;St Helens, Oregon, United States;IPA;Captured by Porches Brewing Company;North American Organic Brewers Festvial - Portland OR Decent IPA flavor this was filled with good malt backing and finish. Not too bad .
Roots Organic Rye;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Roots Organic Brewing;Pours a yellow golden color, slightly hazy. Aroma of honeylike malts and fresh rye bread. Flavor isw light yet quite nicely mlty and rye bread and spicyness that is qhite refreshing. A hint of floral hops. Crisp fiish. Very nice.
Roots Organic Rye;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Roots Organic Brewing;Pours cloudy orange with a soft white head. Another great beer from Roots. Fruity nose with a great rye character and a light herbal finish. Great hop balance throughout, aromatic in the hops and fruits. This brew is so easy to drink, great beer for having a few pints of.
Roots Organic Rye;Portland, Oregon, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Roots Organic Brewing;Reaaallly unfiltered. Thick head. Gorgeous, absorbing fruity aroma - peach, thai basil, incredibly fresh malt, rye, cinnamon...and on it goes. Outstanding. Fresh rye character, light malts and a fruitiness that is lighter than on the nose but still holds pear, apple and orange. Very quaffable brew. Killer stuff.
Upstream Elliot & Daves Baltic Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter - Baltic;Upstream Brewing Company;(Draft, Downtown Omaha) Pours a black body with a thick chocolate brown head. Aroma of dark malts and roastiness. Flavor of roasted malt, molasses, lactose, and licorice with a creamy mouthfeel. A quite respectable beer from Upstream.
Upstream Elliot & Daves Baltic Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter - Baltic;Upstream Brewing Company;on tap at downtown location. This beer would be exciting no matter how it tastes because brewer Elliott Spilker is a Crescent Moon regular - hooray! yummy beer that is very dark in color with perhaps the darkest head I have ever seen on a beer. Sweet roasted flavor, thick palate... I wondered if there was some lactic acid in the mix to deliver such a thick and sweet palate. Slight tart herb-taste on the end. A really interesting beer.
Upstream Elliot & Daves Baltic Porter;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;Porter - Baltic;Upstream Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours black with a dark beige head. When served at the very cold tap temperature, it has a mild coffee-roasted aroma. Slight lacing ringlets appear on the sides of the glass. A quick milk sour tartness gives way instantaneously to a thick, super sweet malted bolus of roasted milk chocolate. I actually get a finishing licorice bloom at the end. This is a very thick beer. Has an intense chewiness that hangs in the mouth. I wonder if this has lactose in it? It sure seems milk sweet. Leaves a nice tingle on the tongue. Also has a definite sulfurous black strap molasses taste. This is one of the finest beers ever poured at the Upstream. Kudos to the inventor, Elliot Spilker.
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;12 oz bottle shared. Brown pour with decent head. Very sweet and malty aromas. Dark fruits and molasses. Flavors were more dried fruit and touches of caramel and burnt sugar. Very good.
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Bottle sampled at RBSG ’08. Pours with a dark brown body topped by a medium thick head with a good amount of lacing. it’s sweet and malty with a nice caramel, roasted coffee and light chocolate notes. Different fro a barleywine, but, nice. Full bodied, smooth and a touch dry.
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;12 oz. bottle, 2001 Vintage, courtesy of hogfodder. Pour is brown black with an off white head. Aroma is scotchy, peaty, earthy, burnt fruit sweetness and caramel. Taste is bright sweetness initially, with some citrus bitterness quickly behind. Smokiness throughout, including a nice long finish. Complex and really nice.
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;12-oz, ’01, thanks, Hogfodder! Hazy dark mahogany with slim gray rim. Big port, toffee, raisin, and oat nose. Light, almost watery body. Orange pith, port, toffee on the mid-palate. Long pithy finish.
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Clear chestnut brown, gentle beige cover, lasting and delicate. Hugely aromatic this one! Beefy honey and port wine notes with full on grape aromas and a touch of apples. Big munich malts onslaught with the nuttiness and toastiness that comes with it, but what sets it apart from beers of similar intentions is the strong vinous character. Neglectable hops throughout even though a mild herbal feel peaks toward mid-mouth. So there you have a complex and unique offering, but its advanced age has started to catch up. Oxidation offers coiny metallic notes in the finish while the hard water makes the whole evolution resting on a rather mineral base. It makes the mouth experience not as pleasant as the smelling, but what an aroma!
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Picked this little gem up at Sugaya. 2001 vintage. Pours dark brown with a minimal tan head. Sweet molasses, malts, roasted malts, chocolate, and milk. Body is a bit on the thin side, but nice. Beautiful flavor. Roasted malts, molasses and caramel, raisins, berries, and the lightest of milk chocolate. Finish is smooth, and roasted. An amazing brew. Definitly mellowed out over the years, hence the lack of any noticeable hops. I wish there was more of this one left out there, but I fear it’s all gone. Outstanding.
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Thanks to Capa for this bottle. 2001 Pours a dark brown color with a tan head. Aroma is strong with caramel matls, roasted malts, floral hops, plums, raisons, molasses, and a little chocolate. Has definitely mellowed over the 6 years since it’s been brewed. Flavor is of roasted malts, molasses, plum, raisons, and a slight hint of coffee. Does have a slightly bitter finish with only a touch of alcohol warming. Truely an amazing brew. Probably my favorite of the Japanese brews.
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;The look: Brownish body with a tan ring of foam The style: Fruity and hop-less barley wine The stuff: Super nose, deep and complex of roasted almonds and herbs floating in caramel. Taste is intense caramel concentrate with complex fruity notes of berries, apples, cherries and why not some kiwis. Thrown in a few almonds and a little molasses and there you go. Not much hops presence (could be because the bottle was 6 years old). Superb beer. Hakusekick-ass Vintage Ale. The how: Japanese themed tasting session at MartinT. Vintage 6 years old bottle from MartinT In conclusion: Very very nice and fulfilling. Hope to one day find a fresher more hoppy bottle.
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;"My Bottom Line: The spectacular offspring of this masterful grain bill should succeed in dazzling the malt lover with its chocolatey plums, caramel raisins and noble vinosity, all in the most comfortably rich mouthfeel. Yes, this is another highly impressive Hakusekikan Barley Wine. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam stays atop the ruby brown. -This one’s definitely not as vinous as the Super Vintage Ale; might be the same grain bill though, just not the same yeast. -Cherry fruitiness even develops after a while. -Alcohol only tickles the throat. -At 6 years old, this one might be on top of the hill right now, if not slowly on its way down. So drink up! Bottles from the 2001 vintage; thx Tim!"
Hakusekikan Vintage Ale;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;2001 Vintage. Could be the only year they made it. Apparently sold out in 2003, but can’t really say its retired as there is one beer store in Kawasaki (Sugaya) that has ample supply (that is until my next visit). The dark brown brew struck me like liquid lightening and I thought I went to heaven where everything smelled like molassess, brownies, plums, dark chocolate and grapes. When I took a sip of heaven and tasted port, brownies, dark chocolate, cherries and molassess, I knew I wasn’t dreaming. This is heaven. Then I was thrown back down to earth and only left with plums and very dark chocolate lingering in my mouth. It was REAL I TELL YOU, I WAS THERE. BELIEVE ME!!!!!

Deschutes Firewood;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;A: Oak, cherry, cinnamon, coriander, rose hips and thyme. Ap: Attractive cloudy, deep auburn caramel color with no head to speak of. F: Begins with massive amounts of spices and pungent oak. Holy crap does this beer have a lot of flavor! Deep round cherry notes blare loudly followed suite by buttery yogurt flavors. The brett is strong in this one. Copious amounts of sage add a crazy amount of even more jam packed flavor. The oak and sourness is so pungent, it scratches the throat and seizes the nasal cavity. Finishes with subtle pinot flavors, good amount of brett and healthy bitterness. P: Medium body, soft and smooth. O: WHOA. This beer is brimming with flavor. Totally memorable.
Deschutes Firewood;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;Sampled during the First Annual Stone Sour Fest. Hazy copper color with a dissapating head. Sour acidic cherry aromas. Acidic flavor is more cherry. It is a little sweet on the flavor than on the aromas. Berry flavor on the finish. Very very tasty
Deschutes Firewood;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;"Sampled on tap at the First Annual Stone Sour Fest, July 2007 This beer is a full amber color and is topped by a wispy, tan, ring of a head. The aroma is quite fruity with solid notes of berries (definitely leans quite strongly towards blackberries), currants and some oak-character that has a light touch. The beer has a fullish body to it and was a bit fuller than I was expecting. The flavor is definitely tart and berry like, it cuts through my palate, despite not being overly sour. There is some sort of chewy fruit-skin like flavor; something like cherry skins, blackberry skins; it definitely gives this an austere, slightly tannic finish that is almost wood like in its concentrated fruit skin character (my guess is that the oak has something to do with this as well). This beer is nicely tart; it leans towards a lactic & fruity acidity. This beer is quite fruity, without being sweet & somehow this accents the tartness. It is surprising how much the pinot grapes have added to the overall fruit notes found in this beer. This beer actually almost has more fruit character than sour funk, but that may be my sour craving preferences talking. The body has a surprising fullness to it that, again, must have been influenced by the barrel aging. This is quite nice, and I was not expecting anything nearly this good."
Deschutes Firewood;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;On tap at Stone. Deep brown with a thick creamy white head. Floral eucalyptus aroma. Initial sweet tangy berry taste transitioning to a wonderfull tea like taste, intense lemon sourness, mint and tobacco taste through out, and a dry acidic finish.
Deschutes Firewood;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;Sampled at the 1st annual Stone Sour Festival 2007. Another hit from Deschutes. This was in my top 3 of the day. The barrel aging done on this one made this beer fantastic.
Deschutes Firewood;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;Draft at Stone. Beer aged in wine barrels are great. This one aged in a Pinot Barrel could only get better. Aroma of spice, leather and grape skins. Nice malt background with a nuttiness in the finish (autolysis, barrel fermented?). Latic sour and tanin add to the finish. The first and last taste of the day, both great. Brewers, bottle this for aging please! Wish I had a hunk of aged Gouda with the salt crystals inside.
Deschutes Firewood;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;Draft-1st brew of Stone 1st Annual Sour Festival, July 22nd 2007. Shared this cool day very mellow day with bikesandbeer, wetherel, westsidethreat, padrefan, fordest, denverlogan and many others. Poured brown with some bubbles on top. Aroma is funky with a woody sugary vinous nose. The taste is sour and potent with a big kick to the throat, reminiscent of both La Folie and Rodenbach Grand Cru. Overall this was really really pretty fantastic. I’d say this ranks in the top 5 overall for all sours I’ve had.
Deschutes Firewood;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;At the Stone Sour fest. Cloudy brown with minimum head. Rich and funky with sour wood and wine aroma and taste.

Shipwrecked Oatmeal Stout;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;Pretty good stuff. It has always seemed to me that too many microbrews made stouts in one of two ways: either syrupy sweet like something you’d pour on a pancake, or like burnt coffee. This one seems to hit a nice balance to me. Goes good with one of their burgers.
Shipwrecked Oatmeal Stout;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;A rare beer shared by Skyview. A good, if unremarkable beer.

Shipwrecked Oatmeal Stout;Egg Harbor, Wisconsin, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Shipwrecked Brew Pub;New for the 2007 summer season, served on draught at the brewpub restaurant in Egg Harbor, Wisconsin. Pours an opaque dark brown brew with an average sized tan head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and tan ring. The stout was poured very cold which explains the head low profile. Aroma of sweet dark molasses, milk chocolate and some flowery hops. Taste is very light carbonation, full bodied, with a smooth milk chocolate and dark malt flavor. Finish is smooth, creamy with a slight bitterness and chocolate aftertaste. This year’s summer brew turned out to be pretty decent beverage.

Calumet Bucholtz Alt;Chilton, Wisconsin, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Rowlands Calumet Brewery;On a side trip to New Holstein, had to stop in at the Roll Inn.

Im Geruch getreidig-malzig. Das Bier schmeckt wie erwartet - getreidig-malzig mit leicht süßlicher Note. Vollmundiger als gedacht. Trotzdem irgendwo wässrig.

Monteiths New Zealand Lager;Greymouth, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);330ml bottle! The beer In glass is surprisingly strong golden with a flat crown on medium and lots of carbonation. The beer smells balanced hoppy malty. The Lager starts malty, subtly grainy, with nuances of sweetness in background. The aftertaste has unfortunately somewhat watery. The further course is, unfortunately, watery, as a whole is a bit harsh. No special treat, too lax and watery.
Monteiths New Zealand Lager;Greymouth, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);[330ml bottle, Peckham’s Edinburgh] Really wasn’t expecting much from this given the other Aussie/Kiwi lagers I’ve forced down over the years, but it was almost something of a surprise. Pretty crisp and thankfully untainted (I’m glad I got no DMS flavours from the bottle I’d acquired). Quite dry too, which makes all the difference. Ok, it’s never going to score spectacularly, but for a cooking lager it’s above average. [29072008]
Monteiths New Zealand Lager;Greymouth, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Monteiths Brewing Co. (DB Breweries);Forgive them, for they know not what they do. Except in this case, i think Montieths did know what they were doing. Sully a once good name with this watery filth in the aim of selling more and more. Hints of DMS was all picked up in aroma and a watery thin-ness with a slight sweetness. Seriously a bad beer. If i hadn’t been at work (and i wouldn’t have drank it if it hadn’t been work drinks) this would have been down the drain in a flash. A waste of a beer.

Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;(Draught) Pours a cloudy golden body with a medium cream head. Aroma of lavender, earth, some wet leather, and mustiness. Flavor of lavender, sour citrus, light herbs, and plenty of funkiness.
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;5.5 ounce pour at Beachwood Sour Fest. Nice pleasant lavender aroma. Taste of lavender is a little too strong.
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap @ Woodshop Classix. The beer poured a bit of an unexpected yellowish amber with light a light sea-foam top. Smell was intensely lavender, and reminded me of some dollar store cleaners. However the nose was soft enough with a slight twist to make it interesting. Taste was intensely Lavender, with a slight tartness which only augmented the lavender to reach a bitterness in my mouth. I found this pretty strange and dissonant, with an odd chewiness despite a lighter body.
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;On tap at Monks Kettle. Pours light amber with a thin off-white head and a vinous aroma. The flavor starts very sour but is mitigated by smooth lavender and turns out to have a very pleasant mix of tastes. If you don’t like the taste of lavender, you may not appreciate this brew. Fortunately, I do.
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;Hard to do but this is a combo of both 2010 and 2011 versions sampled at Stone Sour Fest 2011. Two totally different beers but both excellent for different reasons. I’ll try to merge these and still tell the difference based on notes. A: on both this is outstanding with neither jumping ahead of one another. The lavender comes out a great deal as does some of the sour elements. Slightly more citrus and acidity in the ’11. T: Totally different beers. The ’10 is a mild, slightly sour beer with flavors more muted and easy to drink. I love lavender and find this very much associated with summer. If they sold this in bottles I would buy cases. The ’11 is overly sour with mouth puckering qualities. Over the top and a beer I had been looking for that really gives your stomach that nice sour feel. You can’t drink a lot of this yet the sweetness and lavender still come through. Overall, ’10 is a session sour, ’11 is a sour you can have 4oz of.
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft at Stone Sour Fest 11. Hazy yellow pour, with rocky white head. Grains, definite lavender spice throughout, lemon tartness, very dry and sour. Medium body, refreshing sour. nice!
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;Draft. Sampled at The Bruery Anniversary party. Pours a clear copper color with a slight white head. Some lavender in the nose along with something that smells like cedar. I also get whtie fruit and green apples in the nose. Very fruit forward and sweet with flavors of apple and peach along with some cinnamon spice and lemon. This isn’t too sour but has a nice medium level that ends dryly. Light/medium mouthfeel. This isn’t too bad if you don’t mind a sweeter sour beer.
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;Sample. Rating #15. Good little sour, big lavender profile throughout the beer which really added a very unique element to the beer. (1748)
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;Tasted on tap at the 4th Annual Stone Sour Fest on 7/18/2010. This sour ale pours a medium orange gold color form the tap. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is fruity and tart, herbal and lavender. A medium bodied sour ale. The malts are fruity and sweet, tart and funky. A touch of lavender in the flavor, not nearly as much as in the nose. Nice carbonation, Nice smooth tartness. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly tart.
Craftsman Sour Lavender;Pasadena, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Craftsman Brewing Company;A: The pour is a slightly cloudy golden color with an off-white head. S: The nose is, shockingly, full of lavender. Only a slight tartness, but just an overwhelming lavender aroma and herbal/floral overall. T: The flavor is similar to the aroma. There is some tartness, but I find it just unable to compete with the floral powerhouse that is the lavender. M: The body is light and spritzy, could be refreshing if it tasted better. D: This was like chewing on a lavender plant. The beer certainly lived up to the name, but not in a good/enjoyable way.

Jolly Pumpkin Madrugada Obscura Reserve;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;Bottle from Whole Foods PM. Pours hazy blackish with tan head.

Jolly Pumpkin Madrugada Obscura Reserve;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;2008 MIBGF Special Tap: Near black with ruby highlights, very good head and lace. The aroma has notes of charred and tannic oak, chocolate and raisins, big time brett and lacto funk, and some almost peat like vapours. The taste starts with a major kick in face of wild yeast, sour and aggressive. The malt is a backgorund player here. Some ripen fruit adds depth of palate. The mouth feel is aggressive but yet soft too. Not your daddy’s stout for sure and MIKEY LIKEY.

Jolly Pumpkin Madrugada Obscura Reserve;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;Sampled at the 1st annual Stone Sour Festival 2007. Interesting to see this beer as dark as it is carry some sour notes. I enjoyed this one in color and flavor after seeing through so many of the other samples.
Jolly Pumpkin Madrugada Obscura Reserve;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;"Sampled on tap at the First Annual Stone Sour Fest, July 2007 This has only a dusting of a head, appears to have a very low carbonation. The beer is a chocolate to black color. This definitely smells like a stout, notes of coffee, chocolate and a rich-blackened, concentrated malty character. Underneath the dominant roast driven aromatics is a solid fruitiness of blackened plums & raisins moving towards an almost brandy or rum like note that seems to accent some oak barrel character. Dusty cocoa aromatics are noticeable in the nose as well, but this is really fruity smelling at times. In fact I get a pronounced blackberry note that is so distinct it almost seems like some of them have been added. The taste is quite fruity up front, yet it still maintains quite a dry character overall. The fruitiness is defined by a distinct blackberry flavor that becomes tart and roasted in the middle through to the finish. The pronounced blackberry note comes through in the finish again and lingers long after the beer has left my mouth. The beer is fairly light feeling in the mouth, but it is still rich and almost chewy, which is quite good for a soured beer (or is that the color that makes me think it is rich; I don’t think that is the entire story though). The blackberry note is so pronounced, I almost wonder are these actually somehow involved (what was in the barrel, hell what type of barrel was it). Oaky barrel notes are also noticeable (mostly in the finish); spicy wood notes, a touch of buttery oak, an austere tannic palate coating character. The stout flavors here are definitely noticeable, but not dominantly so; a roast acidity and a character of a smooth, first pull espresso are definitely noticed, but the Stout character is more apparent in the aroma than in the flavor. The barrel for this beer mush have had something in it prior to this beer (Brandy, or more likely some berry like red wine). The blackberry note I have been talking about is not the dominant character here, but it adds such an intriguing accent that is just so apparent. This is very good, much better than I was expecting. I really like how rich this beer is, yet it is still quite quaffable & I really like how this beer melds all of the interesting flavor components."
Jolly Pumpkin Madrugada Obscura Reserve;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;Sampled at Stone’s Sour Festival, July 2007. Ebony brew with no head. Malty stout like aroma but with a strange sour edge to it. The flavor match up well to the nose with an interesting blend of sourness and maltiness. I haved had the nomral Madrugada so i can’t compare bu this beer is in a catagory all its own.
Naylors Aussie Run Out;Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Naylors Brewery;Clear golden with almost no head or carbonation. Very floral scent. Watery but bitter. Perfumed with some grapefruit, almost like turkish delight. Spoilt by a metallic end, otherwise boring with not much there at all.
Deschutes St. Nicholas;Bend, Oregon, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Deschutes Brewery;"Sampled on tap at the First Annual Stone Sour Fest, July 2007 At first this beer smells quite pronouncedly fruity, but in a non-descript sort of way, but then a definite raspberry character starts to come through. The raspberry does not get obnoxious like I find in many a raspberry flavored brew. The beer is a hazy, amber / brown color with a minuscule, ring-like and a few sparse islands of amber froth of a head. Underneath the tartness & fruit aromatics is a real, meaty, malt character; you really have to dig for this, but when you do it is quite noticeable with substantial notes of caramel and malt. There is an interesting herbal note here that is reminiscent of caraway and/or celery seed & savory. This really might just be the raspberry seed / skin notes (assuming whole fruit was used). The beer also has a lightly sweet aromatic bent to it. The taste is somewhat sweet, but is still amazingly drinkable (once again thank the tartness for making this beer quaffable). This is fairly malty, though not as distinctively accented as the aroma was. Flavors of generic berries, definite raspberries and a light lactic acid character are noticeable. The raspberry flavors are certainly the dominant character in the flavor, though again it is not in an overwhelming manner. This is quite a bit more enjoyable than I expected."

Shared this cool day very mellow day with bikesandbeer, wetherel, westsidethreat, padrefan, fordest, denverlogan and many others. Pours dark brown with a tan ring of a head. Nose is light with a rassy and slightly tarrt. The taste is raspberry and pungent with too much alcohol noticeable in my opinion, I know denver and I disagree, this fell short for me because the alcohol came through too much and ruined a lot of it for me.

Dry, roasty, lots of chocolate and grainy aromas, some raisin and dates fruitiness. Taste - Starts with sweet dark malts and bit of sticky fruits, but quickly gives way to lots of roasty, dry malt, some licorice, some umami, with a long, dry, bitter finish (roasty and pleasant at first, but eventually the roast fades to just leave some unpleasant bitter residues on the tongue). Decent medium-bodied palate. Slightly oily, slick mouthfeel that coats your throat; satisfying. Quite a nice Irish style stout; true to the style; very Irish-y. Wholesome and satisfying, nice dark and roasty malts, though the bitter aftertaste lingers for a while and isn’t too pleasant."

Sigtuna Jäst-Hasses Lättöl;Arlandastad, Sweden;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Sigtuna Brygghus;Draught at the brewpub. Clear golden, brief head. Grassy nose with some buttery malt. Dryuish and light bodied, but nowhere near thin. Where other beers of this size showacase water and metal this one shows off bread and butter. Fairly low bitterness. Not a beer for sipping, but for a beer to drink to food on a working lunch it certainly has it’s merits.

St. Austell Free Beer;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;St. Austell Brewery;"Bottled 0,50L. Beautiful intense red color with optimal and fine fizz. Creamy and foamy head of discreet resistance. Determined and sugary aroma with notes of burned wood, resin, bark, toasted malt. Extremely prickly and lively taste; perhaps too much decided fizzy content. Solid body with pleasant and overbearing bitter tenor and good alcoholic content. Thanks to my cousins Marco for this one."
St. Austell Free Beer;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;St. Austell Brewery;Bottled(500ml). -courtesy of and shared with doggythedog, thanks. Nice clear amber coloured, minimal head, few streams of carbonation. Bitterish herbal hop aroma with notes of caramel, but a bit too watery.
St. Austell Free Beer;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;St. Austell Brewery;0.5l bottle brought from England by a friend (thanks Ivana!) Dark amber colour, small off white head that collapsed quickly but left some traces for quite a while. The nose is nice... caramel, somewhat fruity and nutty, some fresh herbal hopiness. Staleish, empty taste, citric acididity and some bitterness, from hops I guess, muddy maltiness, vaguely nutty and fruity. Guarana? Erm, where? Faint but long hoppy aftertaste. Looks nice, smells nice, but the taste is just too weak and dull.
St. Austell Free Beer;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;St. Austell Brewery;Bottle. Odd, caramelly sweetness, sappy, weedy. Sweet, with an odd acidity. Feels a bit stale in the mouthfeel, and the finish is sticky, and short. Not very good.
St. Austell Free Beer;St. Austell, Cornwall, England;Strong Ale - English;St. Austell Brewery;Bottle, 500ml, bottle conditioned. An amber colour with a small dissipating head. Aroma is fantastic and long-lasting: nutty roasted malt, fresh hops and caramel. Taste is more nutty roasted malt, floral hops, a touch of caramel, citrus and some other fruity notes (perhaps that’s the guarana coming through). A somewhat citric, lightly bitter finish with a lingering taste of malt. Nicely balanced and overall an enjoyable brew. But why on earth would you want guarana (and therefore caffeine) in a beer???
A. Le Coq Special 1807;Tartu, Estonia;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;A. Le Coq (Olvi);Pours yellowy gold, decent thick white head, malty bready aroma, weak malty hoppy taste that disappears fairly quickly. Although it is named special I don't find anything special about it, besides the logo. Random lager. A gift from friend Jim.

Deschutes Old Sam Hain;Bend, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Deschutes Brewery;Nitro tap @ their Portland Public House... Poured orange with a thick, frothy head. Mild aroma of malted grains. Foamy, soft palate with cracker and biscuit flavors and spicy hops and malt towards the finish. Reminded me of a British session bitter.
Deschutes Old Sam Hain;Bend, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Deschutes Brewery;Halloween beer tasted on Jan 3 at the brewery tap in Portland. Nitro. Clear golden color with large thick white head. Not much aroma. Very creamy, like a Boddingtons but with less body, less hops, and less character overall.
EARL des Grimaux Poiré Domfront;Mantilly, France;Perry;EARL des Grimaux;Bottle at Cider Tap, Euston. Ripe pear on the nose, bit of alcohol spice yet quite clean. Very pale straw in colour, small ring of white foam. Quite sweet upfront, dries out a bit, touch of acid with notes of ripe green pear skin, spice and alcohol warmth ot finish. Nice fullness about the body, relatvely high but soft carbonation. Enjoyable perry and champagne-like qualities.
EARL des Grimaux Poiré Domfront;Mantilly, France;Perry;EARL des Grimaux;"Four different ciders with ""Poiré Domfront"" registered at ratebeer, so this might be the wrong one, but the ABV is a match, so... 750 ml bottle @ Poirotti, Helsinki. Pale straw color, low white head. Strong, dry fruity aroma. Sweet pear flavor with a slightly dry finish. Medium body, medium-high carbonation. Best perry ever, but that’s not saying all that much."
EARL des Grimaux Poiré Domfront;Mantilly, France;Perry;EARL des Grimaux;[i]Bottle (75 cl) bought at a shop in Bayeaus, Normandie, France[/i]. Pale golden, slightly hazy, with small floating yeast particles. Gray pears dominate the aroma, which is quite non-complex, with some horse-stable notes. Light to medium bodied, nice sparkling mouthfeel. A bit too much on the sweet side for me.
Bellwether Hard Cider Legacy;Trumansburg, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Bellwether Hard Cider;Sampled at the New Amsterdam Market Cider Revival. Dusty, faded yellow color. Quick splash of suds. Smells a bit briney, w/ lots of acidy skin. Yeasty, w/ an odd stuffiness. Taste is skin, spent yeast, & chalky flesh. Strong acid. Faintly veggie. Lightly tart, pithy finish. Itchy feel & forced carbonation. Not a fan of these guys. Inoffensive, but they all seem watered down or just plain old.
Bellwether Hard Cider Legacy;Trumansburg, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Bellwether Hard Cider;750mL Bottle, poured at CiderDays 2012. Electric spice and leather. A real musky black cardamon-like sensation. Very funky throughout. The bitterness of the apples is interesting and punches out the finish nicely. Waxy mid-palate. Nice bubbles.
Bellwether Hard Cider Legacy;Trumansburg, New York, United States;Apple Cider;Bellwether Hard Cider;Bottle. Clear amber body with nice head. I thought this was the best of the Bellwehter Ciders. Surprisingly a little complex on the palate. Slightly dry with a nice tartness to it.
John Harvards Double O Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;"This oatmeal stout pours an opaque black color with no light passing through. Aroma is sweet but not too sweet, fresh, chocolatey, malty, and roasty. Flavor was very balanced between bitter hoppiness and sweet chocolate; nothing was overpowering. Palate was superior, full body, great subtle fresh/chocolate aftertaste."
John Harvards Double O Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at the brewpub. Arrived at the table very dark brown, just about black, with a moderate off-white head that faded to a film after the first quarter of the glass and left a lingering layer of foam with each sip. Pleasant aroma of lightly roasted malt. The flavor is again lightly roasted malt with some mild sweetness. Smooth, almost silky mouthfeel which is abruptly cut short by some moderate bitterness at the finish. Medium bodied.
John Harvards Double O Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Nitro. Aroma of light roasted malt, and some sort of generalized sweetness. Flavor an interesting combination of this sweetness (oatmeal?) and tart fruits with increasing notes of milky chocolate. Light nitro mouthfeel, but not really watery or anything unpleasant about it, and certainly highly gulpable. Pretty tasty.
John Harvards Double O Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;On tap at JH. Pours dark brown with a slowly disappearing light tan head. Aroma of light roast. Very faint aroma. Flavor is quite sweet (oatmeal and chocolate) with a slight roasted malt finish. Pretty gulpable and smooth but I found the palate a touch watery. The sweetness got to me a little as well and it was a bit artificial. Meh.
John Harvards Double O Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Poured a very dark brown with a medium creamy tan head. Roasty aroma with a light ash note. Mildy sweet. Roaaty flavor with sweetness. Light to medium body.
John Harvards Double O Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Nitro pour and compared to others rating of the cask I have to think it really went down a notch cause of that. Damn thing took like 10 minutes to properly form a head so I could drink it (what a waste of time). Black with thick dark tan head. Aroma is bit metallic (seems to be nitro interference) that is covering up some light roast. Taste is much better with that charred/cigarette burning roastiness. Some chocolate as well. Easy drinking on top of that.
John Harvards Double O Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;(Cask) Dark black beer with a creamy dark tan head. The nose is full of sweet chocolate and lightly roasted coffee. Fairly nutty and sweet with a nice malt complexity. Sweet earthy character through the middle. The oats come out on the palate giving a silky smoothness, but not a great deal of flavour. Light caramel and chewy milk chocolate. A good solid easy-drinking stout. Tasty.
John Harvards Double O Stout;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;[cask] - this new brewer is really impressing me with his stouts - nearly opaque out of the hand pump, with great head retention - lightly roasty aroma, with thick cream sweetness and hints of vanilla - smooth, extra-creamy mouthfeel (though I’m sure part of that was because it was on cask) - you can almost taste the oats - flavors of sweet cream, light chocolate - balancing roasty notes and a tiny bit of vanilla - nicely balanced.
Triple Rock Reindeer Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;On tap @ Triple Rock. Amber pour with an off-white head. Fairly hop forward aroma. Lots of pine, wood, herbs, and grapefruit. Lightly minty. Some sweet caramel and toast, too. Flavor is lightly sweet. Decent caramel, toast, and bread. A hint of orange peel, some mint, grapefruit, and big time pine flavor and bitterness.
Triple Rock Reindeer Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;I had this on tap at Triple Rock in Berkeley. The description basically said that it was a big red ale, and it was, with some pronounced hops. IMO it lacked a bit in balance
Triple Rock Reindeer Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;A - Served a copper-red with a thin layer of white head atop. The head fades down fairly quickly leaving a touch of lace. S - Aroma is a mix of sweet caramel malts with pine/earthy hops. There is also some richer bready malts as well in the background. T - Starts off similar to the nose with sweet caramel bready malts with some pine/grassy hop and light bitterness. Through the middle, more bitterness comes through with some richer malt flavor. The finish is a mix of sweet bready malt with some pine and earthy hops and some bitterness. M - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a dry and bitter finish. D - Very drinkable. Nice big red ale with a good amount of hops that balances the big malty backbone well.
Triple Rock Reindeer Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;On tap. Pours with a hazed red hued body with a lasting tan head.

Medium to slightly lively carbonation.
Triple Rock Reindeer Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;On draft at Triple Rock. This year’s version is an imperial red at 7.8% ABV. It pours reddish copper with a small cream colored head. The aroma has lots of red fruity hops with some caramel backing. The flavor has a strong hop presence of pine, spice and decent caramel notes before a big bitter finish. Certainly a hop forward red with just a hint of maltiness.
Triple Rock Reindeer Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;Clear deep garnet red with a creamy off white head. Citrus and herbal hops hang on the nose beside sweet spice and toasted grain. Tastes of citrus hops coffee toasted grain and a hint of nutmeg with a smooth roasty and citrus finish. Very good.

This spiced ale poured a medium amber color from the firkin. Small sized white head. Aroma is caramel, fruity, sweet and spicy. A light to medium bodied holiday ale. The malts are caramel and fruity.

Triple Rock Reindeer Ale;Berkeley, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Triple Rock Brewery & Alehouse;"Beautiful deep red-burgundy beer; smallish yellow-brown head. Hoppy nose, with dark malts & chocolate. Aroma as from dark green leaves - holly? Hop tea: with malt, aromatic hops, bitterhops, and bitter leaf vegetables as Roman salad or spinach. Good balance. Spices, retronasal, are unidentifyable. Medium bodied at best. Weak point of this beer is its rather thinnish body, beefed-up by the spices. Thank God ( and Rodger D.) this bears no resemblance to their I. Wit. This one is quite passable!"
Bogotá Beer Company (BBC) Scotch Ale;Bogota, Colombia;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bogotá Beer Company (AB InBev);Great Taste 09. Nice pour with dark golden/amber color. Aroma of caramel and light toast. Medium body that could have used a little more malt and caramel. Not bad.
Golden Avalanche Raspberry Lager;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Tap @ brewery. Pours a clear golden color with a full, pillowy head. Nose is lightly sprinkled with raspberry essence. Flavor is a refreshing raspberry cooler. It’s lightly carbonated and thge flavors are not overwhelming (not a big lager), but it is very quenching. Nice brew for the summer.
Golden Avalanche Raspberry Lager;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;Draft at the brewery. Clear, lightly tinted reddish yellow colored body. Bad candy syrup and plastic raspberry nose, overly perfumy, with notes of acetone. Stenchy, strong smelling. Taste is pasty up front, then turns oily. Soap, perfume, more acetone, cherry cough syrup, all of this sounds bad but the truth is that it wasn’t very flavorfull, which means the bad wasn’t really bad. Still, this has to be one of the worst beers I’ve had in years. I don’t see how anyone would want to drink this.
Golden Avalanche Raspberry Lager;Kutztown, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Golden Avalanche Brewing Co.;"Draft @ Golden Avalanche, pre-BCTC beerventure, shared (all too willingly) by lilannie. Thanks, Anne! Pours a clear, yellow-amber color; little head left to speak of. Overly sweet, perfumy aroma; like walking through the center of a department store; some raspberry poking through. Sweet, gummy mouthfeel: cheap raspberry syrup with the slightest hint of sugary malts; unpleasant, slightly tart, and difficult to finish; light carbonation. Vaguely sour, raspberry finish."
Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;Pours reddish amber with a thin white head. Aroma of spicy wheat malt.

Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;"This isn't one of my favorite styles, but I enjoyed this one. Got it in the Harvest Collection, so had a few in there I hadn't sampled yet. Medium brown to amber cloudy unfiltered appearance. Aroma is wheaty with some sour fruit in there. Flavor is caramel, wheat, some sweet and sour fruit....with a decent hop finish. Like a ""poor man's"" Belgian. I would get this again."
Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;"Deep, fairly hazy light brown and almost a light copper and bronze coloured body with a thick, super dense four to five centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of yeast, bread, alcohol, light grain, some subdued malts and more yeast, but the bananas, cloves and belgian yeast note are beyond evident. Medium-bodied; Super pungent yeasty bite with a big grain and malt side of things with a nice sweetness from citrus and lighter fruits and a dose of carmelised sugars as well. Aftertaste shows yeast, light grain, some bread and a dose of bubble gum and bananas, but mostly just a bready, grainy finish with some moderate complexity, but nothing harsh or pungent at all. Overall, a nice and elegant beer that shows well for the style throughout, but nothing pungent, too harsh and especially exciting that makes this a must drink. That said, for the style, this is very respectable, especially as easy as this would be to get, plus the convenience of the can, and even more enjoyable - the price point I had for this one! I sampled this twelve ounce can purchased from GlenRo Spirit Shoppe in Monroe, Connecticut on 10-March-2018 for US$1,00 sampled at home on the Eastern shore of Virginia in Pungoteague, Virginia on 19-April-2018."
Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;Light amber, crystal clear, tall and lasting head. Aromatic nose. Medium to full body, flavorful, silky texture, foamy and vibrant mouthfeel, moderate heat, long aftertaste. Modestly bitter, off dry, refreshing and crisp. Predominantly malty, biscuit, yeasty. Surprisingly enjoyable for someone not a fan of the style, very well made. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;"12oz can from Wegmans, West Seneca. A slightly hazy golden amber pour with a tight cream head; arom a of wheat, yeast, spice and cloves; soft in the mouth with gentle spices and caramel, and then a touch of spice & banana to finish. Much lighter in colour than a German Dunkel, but otherwise true to style."
Samuel Adams Dunkelweizen;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Boston Beer Company;Pour from a 12oz can - fall canned beers collection. Clear medium brown brew with tan head. Very engaging aroma of fruit, banana, clove, coriander - very much in the wit / wheat family. Taste is mildly sweet up front with rich fruity notes, some tartness with clove, banana and fruit. Finishes with a sour / tart fruit taste, though weakens somewhat at the very end where I would look for a flourish of taste. Palate is average verging on thin.
Oliver's Oldfield SV Perry (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Oliver's Cider;375ml bottle from Olivers. Pale yellow gold colour, no head and aroma of leather, funky pear.

Oliver's Oldfield SV Perry (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Oliver's Cider;375ml screw-top bottle from Appellation Wines, Dalry Road. Pours clear still pale yellow. Aromas of sweet apple and pear. Taste has a funky note, but then a sweet pear vibe takes over. Judging from the ingredients it looks like they’ve back-sweetened this, which is a shame. I’d like to have tried it in its funkier form.
Oliver's Oldfield SV Perry (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Oliver's Cider;Bottle from Appellation Wines. It’s a half wine bottle size. Appearance - yellow with a little froth on top.

Oliver's Oldfield SV Perry (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Perry;Oliver's Cider;RE-RATE 375ml bottle 5.0%, from Olivers. Pours very pale straw, clear. Light and a litlte oily on the palate, white wine like in feel with a light perry sweetness. Very good. 75cl bottle from Oliver’s Farm shop. Marketed as ’champagne perry’ but just seems like a normal sweet perry to me. That said, it is a good one.. fruity, juicy and great with a desert.

Telegraph Unblended Barrel Reserve Porter;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Telegraph Brewing (Epic Brewing UT/CO);On tap. Bourbon Barrel Stock Porter. Pours with a deep brown body with a large and creamy tan head. Aromas are of brown sugar, dark fruit, vinous, Laffy Taffy, mild diacetyl, mineral, barrel and some acidity. Flavors are tart, tobacco, woody barrel character, brown sugar, soil, and some sort of cocktail or liquor that I cannot place. Almost aperol like. Lively carbonation, dry, a bit creamy.
Telegraph Unblended Barrel Reserve Porter;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Telegraph Brewing (Epic Brewing UT/CO);On tap at Hamiltons. Black with a creamy tan head. Roasty grainy aroma. dry citrus slight chocolate taste with a watery palate. Not as much bourbon as I had hoped for, but still not bad. Earlier Rating: 7/29/2007 Total Score: 3.8 On tap at Stone. Very dark brown with no head. Chocolate malt aroma. Chocolate and roasted malt taste with oak notes and a clean finish.
Telegraph Unblended Barrel Reserve Porter;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Telegraph Brewing (Epic Brewing UT/CO);Sampled during the First Annual Stone Sour Fest. Dark brown with a tan head. Aromas were roasty chocolate with some sour notes. Flavors were classic porter dust. Not very sour actually, and a slightly bitter finish. Pretty good.
Telegraph Unblended Barrel Reserve Porter;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Telegraph Brewing (Epic Brewing UT/CO);On tap at Stone. Pours blackish w/ minimal lacing. I thought this was aged in a whiskey barrel from the aroma and the flavor. Smells like an old malted whiskey barrel w/ some vegetation. Surprisingly light nectar w/ minimal residual effers. It’s almost flat. Flavors are unusual and as I said before exhibits whiskey overtones. It is quite complex but not real enjoyable. The sour character is defined and so is the oak w/ no detectable sweetness at all.. Other nuances of a floral perfume, vegetation, slight black cherry w/ a mild roast component. The finish has the hallmark souring and leaves the palate a bit confused.
Telegraph Unblended Barrel Reserve Porter;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Telegraph Brewing (Epic Brewing UT/CO);"Sampled on tap at the First Annual Stone Sour Fest, July 2007 This beer has quite a funky nose to it; it is so funky it seems almost unintentional. The aroma is lightly tart, yet has caramel and toasted malt notes to it. It has a funky mustiness to it and almost a leather-like quality to it as well. The head has some good staying power and is light brown colored. The body of the beer is a hazy brown color. The taste is dry, yet it still has quite the brown ale profile; notes of toasted malt, caramel, browned, biscuit like grain and a light burnt soda cracker flavor. This beer in some way is clean compared to other sour beers here today, yet it still has a light tartness and even an underlying funkiness that some of the other sour beers have not had. This has a phenolic note that is almost plastic like and is a bit hot. This is actually a bit unbalanced as the phenolics seem to dominate the flavor profile after a bit. The brown grain character seems to accentuate the phenolics at times too. This definitely seems unintentionally funky to me; it doesn’t quite work, but was still worth a try. The flavors are interesting (especially the combination of dark malts and funk), though a bit harsh in the end."
Telegraph Unblended Barrel Reserve Porter;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Telegraph Brewing (Epic Brewing UT/CO);Sampled at the 1st annual Stone Sour Festival 2007. A barrel reserve porter that is sour? Wierd. but not bad. Different for sure.

Shared this cool day very mellow day with bikesandbeer, wetherel, westsidethreat, padrefan, fordest, denverlogan and many others. Pours dark brown with a half finger tan head. The nose is very sour and very funky and pretty damn weird. The taste is sour and light and really not very porter like in any way except perhaps appearance. Weird.

Raasted Oatmeal Stout;Randers, Denmark;Stout - Oatmeal;Raasted Bryghus;This is an easy drinking and above-average bodied stout based on a moderate roast. Mellow with age, the head disapears, the carbonation is there but not intrusive in the drinking expeience. The aroma is there and mellowed as well. A good switch from the coffees and chocolates of North America, but oh yes it included those characteristics as well

James Squire Brewhouse Smugglers Spice;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Flavored - Other;James Squire Brewhouse;25 Jul 2007 - Sweet malt and big cinnamon, light clove and a touch of celery aroma. Dark brown-red colour with a good head. Big cinnamon spiced and light malt flavour. Bittter finish, but two much of a sickly spice too drink too much of this beer, unless it is with a desert.
James Squire Brewhouse Smugglers Spice;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Flavored - Other;James Squire Brewhouse;Served too cold at the Portland hotel. Cloudy dark amber with a creamy tan head. Heavy spiced aroma, cloves, cardamom and cinnamon, underneath the plethora of spice lay some honey, cocoa and floral hops. Medium body, full and alcoholic enough to suit the ’winter ale’ category I’m assuming they were aiming for. The flavours are also heavily spiced, perhaps just a bit too much, the honey comes though a bit which was nice though. Tends towards nutty chocolate in the finish, which is otherwise quite harsh. Another good beer from the brewhouse, it reminded me of a Swedish beer called Falcons Julmumma. This beer is loads better than Julmumma though, at least this has body. Im going to knock this back a bit, I actually couldnt finish a pint of this yesterday, its way too spiced... had to swap it for a friends portland pale!
Bent River Black Lager;Moline, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bent River Brewing Company;On tap at brewey, been a long time since they have brewed this, pours a very dark brown, nearly black with a thin tan head and spotty lacing in the glass, aroma is of dark malt and chocolate, flavor has a nice malty front end with some chocolate and sweetness in the finish, pretty drinkable, not bad.
Bent River Black Lager;Moline, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bent River Brewing Company;Had on tap at the brewpub the first time I visited the place. A very nice schwarzbier and a nice first impression from a great place.
Bent River Black Lager;Moline, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bent River Brewing Company;Clear dark ruby to black. Some straw-colored head, though wuickly lost. Clean, somewhat sweet aroma. Sweet and malty, roasty, and biscuity. Overcarbonated.
Bent River Black Lager;Moline, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bent River Brewing Company;Dark plum and brown colored body with an off-white head. Lightly sweet nose with some faint yeast esters, dough-like with a little pepperiness. Flavor is clean and crisp, straightforward with some roast, mild char and cracked grains. Lightly smoky and ashy as well.
Bent River Black Lager;Moline, Illinois, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Bent River Brewing Company;From a growler. Poured a clear, dark garnet brown color with red highlights. Head was thick and foamy with good retention. A bit of lace was left behind. Aroma was of cocoa and subdued coffee. I occasionally got a whiff of noble hops as well. Slightly sweet on the tongue and medium bodied. Tasted of mellow cocoa, light roasty malt, and black tea. The hops were not evident to me in the flavor. Good schwarzbier.
Rock Bottom Yorktown The Thunder;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Arrived from the tap at Yorktown with a creamy tan head atop chocolate brown goodness. It looked so very much like a stout, that I thought that my server had mistakenly described it as a belgian. A faint malty aroma. Nice creamy mouthfeel, roasted chocolate malt notes to start and then some of the rum-raisin notes I would expect in a Belgian Strong. I decided half-way through the giant mug that it was like a Belgian Guinness. Not exactly what I would expect for a Belgian strong (Chimay blue, Unibroue Maudite, Goose Island Demolition) but very tasty nonetheless.
Rock Bottom Yorktown The Thunder;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Nitro pour, unfrosted Mug Club glass. Looks just a stout, except the bubbles cling to the glass instead of cascading. Thick, creamy gray head. Light chocolate smell. Very creamy nitro texture. It does suggest a Belgian styled stout: smoothly roasted chocolate malts, a phantom bitterness behind the palate, some plum and blackberry. Even a suggestion of oatmeal creaminess. Some wit esters pop up toward the middle, but a nice finish.
Rock Bottom Yorktown The Thunder;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Rock Bottom Yorktown;From the tap this pours a very dark brown and has the feeling that it might be hazy. Its creamy tan head laces the glass with slippery sheets. The inttial aroma is of prunes, raisins, and lightly roasted malt. As it warms, some cocoa reaches the surface. Creamy and medium bodied to drink, milk chocolate comes to the forefront of the flavor, followed by the dark dried fruits and dark roasted grains. Pretty interesting, tasty drink. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Poured into a nonic pint glass, the appearance was a transparent brown color with a slowly moving carbonation rising to fill a slowly dissipating foamy/bubbly white/creamy head. Soft stringy lace with some bubbles. The aroma took sweet caramel and cocoa malts to intertwine with some bready notes, light toast and brown sugar. Sly cherry sweetness. The flavor copies the aroma pretty much spot on with a crisp bready contour aligning into the aftertaste and then has a quick semi-sweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation with the ABV seemingly to play appropriately with the feel - good. Overall, nicely done old ale that I would have again.
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle at Sander’s place, NYC. Pours clear brown with a fine, beige cream head. Some sweet malts on the nose, nips of bread, caramel and cocoa. Medium sweet flavor, some cocoa, dry caramel, toast, brown sugar. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Some dry toast to finish, dirt, burnt leaves, light chocolate, dried fruits. Good stuff.
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;On tap at the brewpub.

Long smooth finish, nice lingering caramel sweetness. Nicely done.
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle shared by kmweaver on 7/3/08: Porus a transparent dark copper with a spotty-lacing light tan head. Aroma of sweet toasty dark caramel malts with a touch of maple syrup and light tartness. Body starts with about average fullness and some sweet dark caramel ntoes along with a touch of light fruits and mild earthy bitterness. Has some milk chocolate and light fruity tartness toward the finish.
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bottle shared by kmweaver. Nice raw maple syrup and wood aromas in the nose, with the flavor more of a strange and twangy resinous cherry and moss, some green, wet, damp moss throughout, stale apple and plum, some sort of semi-sweet-maybe-spoiled maple note, somewhat astringent and flabby on the tongue.
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;"22oz bottle, courtesy of jjpm74 (I think). Thanks, John! Pours a dark cola-brown color; light tan head with decent, fine-bubbled lacing. Loads of maple syrup and caramelized brown sugar in the aroma; so much maple syrup; generic bitterness and a soft vanilla note. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: relaxed carbonation; lots of maple syrup, again, caramel, and dried fruits; slightly watery at the edges, but dense maltiness otherwise; drinkable stuff. Medium mouthfeel: maple syrup, caramel, and dried fruits; some lingering sweetness."
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;22 ounce bottle from jjpm74. Pour is sort of a cherry cola or Dr Pepper brown/red with a big frothy beige head. The nose comes of very cardboard-ish, along with some hints of dried cherries, caramel, and maple. The flavor has some cardboard character too. Also over cooked caramel, and dark honey. Just enough hops to make it bitter. On the light side of medium body. Average carbonation. Dry finish. If I would have realized that this was only a 6% beer, I’d have drank it long ago. Not sure it would have made a difference though. Just OK.
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Tannic. Ruddy brown. Fruity caramel tones, dark fruit, syrup. Pretty fair.
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Bomber. Pours brown with an off white head. Smells of caramel, roses, raisins. Tastes swet and chewy with some nice spicy elements. Not as full bodied as most of their other beers, but good.
Barrington Old Pluto;Great Barrington, Massachusetts, United States;Old Ale;Barrington / Berkshire Mountain Brewery;Pours a clear brown color with a ring of creamy, light brown lace.

Whitstable Supreme Blonde;Maidstone, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Whitstable Brewery;Cask (handpump) at the Wenlock Arms, Islington. Nor sure whether this is a one-off special or a new regular summer seasonal - I guess we’ll find out next year as there’s no mention of it on the brewery website. Mid gold, with a loose white head. Scant aroma - just a touch of citrus. Much more lemony citrus in the flavour. Mouthfeel is clean but a little short of bite. A respectable, if unspectacular, refreshing summer ale nonetheless.
Whitstable Supreme Blonde;Maidstone, Kent, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Whitstable Brewery;Cask gravity at Kent BF, Canterbury. Gold with lasting off white head. Some citrus on aroma, good condition, reasonable hop on end. After drinking Dark Star Hophead though, this was a tad bland.

Slightly yeasty, dark mild aroma, choccy. Actually it’s really good, I hate to admit it of Sheps, but it is a very drinkable, nice, balanced dark mild.
St. Austell Proper Job (Cask);St. Austell, Cornwall, England;IPA - English;St. Austell Brewery;Real ale ticking in London. I feel like Mick the Tick. What's a Cornish IPA? Doesn't taste like corn. Oh well. Bright clear golden with a lacy white head. Aroma is very bright, pineapple, leaves, floral notes. Flavor is medium sweet with a good floral/light fruit bitterness. Medium body, very crisp. I like it. But where's the corn? Not very cornish if you ask me.

Grindleton Ribble Rouser;Clitheroe, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grindleton Brewhouse;Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Pale straw with slight head. Thin dry bitter with very little character to grab hold of. Some lightly boiled vegetable notes rather than hop impact. Not great.

Grindleton Ribble Rouser;Clitheroe, Lancashire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Grindleton Brewhouse;A lacy white head lasts over the clear light golden body. Annoyingly vegetal nose reminds of celery salt combined with its strong mineral backbone. Simplistic floral hop profile. Light-bodied, comfortable and easy-drinking, growing more of a bite in the finish where a certain zesty feel can be noticed, but its malts are timid all along and while it is fresh, the hops don’t really fit with the saltiness.

Nose is packed to the brim with hops, mostly earthy and wooden, but with a slight citrusy undertone. Soft and full on the palate, the beer almost immediately hits you with a palate-killing peppery hop bitterness, only assuaged slightly by a sweet bready malt character. The finish is long and very drying, with a vegetable-like hop flavor. Alcohol is buried by the IBUs, in a good way. There’s almost no roasted character to the beer either, which is surprising considering the color. An unusual and intruiging beer, although probably one I won’t seek out.

Watermill W'ruff Night (Cask);Ings, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Watermill (aka Windermere Brewing);Cask at the brewpub. A good strong pale ale. Strangely, a touch of sherry in the aroma. Plenty of bitterness, which becomes more rounded with drinking. Although it’s described as pale, dry & hoppy, I found the finish quite sweet and faintly vineous, with some caramel in the background and also in the finish.

Hawkshead Damson Stout;Staveley, Cumbria, England;Stout;Hawkshead Brewery;Black beer with a thin, bubbly off-white head. Flavour is light fruit, slightly tart (presumably the damsons.) When you first take a swig it’s just a run of the mill stout but the damson flavour, which is light but distinct and balanced just right, comes and gives it something slightly different. And it’s the damson which lingers too, though it’s not overpowering as it might have been if they’d got it wrong. Very nice.

Hawkshead Damson Stout;Staveley, Cumbria, England;Stout;Hawkshead Brewery;On tap at What’s Brewing. A dense, beige, finger-thick head forms over a dark brown to black body. The aroma is roasted and lightly smoked, with brown sugar and caramel sauce. Was expecting some fruityness, or at least some dried fruits, but didn’t find any. It has a nice bitterness, it’s full-bodied and with a low level of carbonation, in a nice way. Dry. Roasted malts, caramel sauce and brown sugar in the lasting flavor. Some acidic notes in the very end. A nice one indeed, although not world class. 141101

Bullfrog Unique Singel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bullfrog Brewery;"Thanks to MrChopin! Really tough cork to pull out. Nose holds big vegetal cooked spinach, wheaty grain, and belgian spice. The flavor is much of the same; too much vegetal flaw for me. Some decent yeast presence, but really ruined by that green quality. Bleh."

Nose is tripel like, brown sugar and melon with light grain and green apple, very doughy. Flavor is doughy, light apple skin, pepper, yeast, biscuity finish which carbonation detracts from, could use a bit more sweetness, bit of nail polish, paper. Drinks as much like a berliner now than anything else, probably best compared to Petrus aged pale.
Bullfrog Unique Singel;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Bullfrog Brewery;750mL thanks to MrChopin. Pours a very hazy peach- murky. Large, off-white head with webby lacing. Dried pear nose, big golden raisins, mild yellow apples, vanilla. Mild candi sugar and tripel esters. Palate is fresh, bright, effervescent. Taste brings sharp yellow apples, small cidery off character. Still, not bad and a great style that is sadly hard to come by. Sour/Wild is probably not the right category for an Abbey Singel.

Sierra Nevada Anniversary Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"This is a good all-around beer. Nothing really ""wows"" me about this, but at the same time have no complaints. I like it better than SNPA. Recently tried their 2009 Harvest Fresh Hop, and liked that better than this but was also more $$$. Has an dark yellow-orange appearance. Aroma leans toward grapefruit. Good balance of malts and hops. Bought as a single to sample, but this is something that I would try again."
Sierra Nevada Anniversary Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"From Aug 2007 Purchased at Poplar Wine & Spirits in Casper for ~US$9.00 Pours from 12oz bottle a clear amber with a good head of foam that shrinks quickly leaving some spotting near the center of my glass and it has some lacing. The smell is hop dominated at first but further whiffs in, I can smell some good sweet malt...nicely balanced nose. The taste follows the nose to a T. Nice hop presence that is slightly grassy, slightly citrusy and put them together and they make for some good hop bitterness but...this IPA does not neglect the malt at all. Good malt sweetness, along with some bread, balances the hops *very* well and the end result is a very tasty, drinkable and yeah, *balanced*(did I mention that yet ;^) IPA that I can and will enjoy more of soon. There are plenty of other IPAs out there to enjoy if I want a good(read Big) hop kick. The more balanced ones....they're kind of a rare breed in Casper so you'll excuse me if I show some prejudice to this example by Sierra Nevada. I think it's very good stuff!"

Sierra Nevada Anniversary Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Originally rated on 9/22/08. Anniversary ale poured a deep copper body, with good carbonation that lead to a thick off white cap. Aroma was pleasent with a strong floral hop presence similar to their pale ale but a little stronger. Flavor was a disappointment, a long lasting, overwhelming bitterness that overpowered the floral notes. Maybe my batch was old, who knows, i am not sure if i would try it again.

Lions Tale Lion Bru;Market Drayton, Shropshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Lions Tale;7th April 2015: two hand-pulled pints at the brewpub. Think they have up’ed the ABV and added some caramel because the beer didn’t taste like the other three rater’s have said.

Lions Tale Blooming Blonde;Market Drayton, Shropshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Lions Tale;Hand-pulled half-pint in the brewpub on 11th Jan 2014. Guess what colour it was: correct, blonde. White head. This is one of those citrus flavoured blondes that I don’t really like. It may well be delicate and difficult to brew but I’m fed up with them, especially during the winter months. Anyway there was nothing wrong with this, I had it because I wanted the tick I suppose. If you like these citrus brews you’d enjoy this one. I’ve tried to score it objectively.

Pale golden body, clear and bright, the head a white blanket of tight foam. Another citrusy flavoured golden beer from Salopian, although they are very good at this style of brewing I am bored with them, not just Salopian, but all the UK brewers who churn these beers out month after month with very little variation in looks, aroma and taste. Maybe my palate is not trained to pick up the subtle differences? Anyway, scored objectively, even if the beer was not ’my cup of tea’.

Church Brew Halberts Saison;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Church Brew Works;A- Cloudy straw yellow body with thin white head. The head eventually fades to a collar and the brew leaves behind some lacing in the glass. The fog in this beer moves around and makes it seem alive. S- Light nose of spicy belgian yeast. In the background are sour earthy esters, coriander, and hints of citrus. T- Strong sour estery and somewhat acidic taste all the way through. Spicy belgian yeast upfront with citrus and coriander in the background. The finish is somewhat acidic. Spicy belgian yeast remains on the palate. P- Light carbonation and smooth yeasty body. Goes down easy. O- This is a decent saison with a nice farmhouse feel. This is a little bit spicier than others that I have tried but thats a good thing. Something I would like to order again.

Church Brew Halberts Saison;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Church Brew Works;Draft at the brewpub. Hazy gold with a thin white head.

Church Brew Halberts Saison;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Church Brew Works;Draft... Hazy golden ale with little to no head. The ultra fruity, lightly toasted nose is chock full of apricot, peach, pear, green apple and orange peel in tandem with a bold, clove-like phenol. Light to medium-bodied with lazy carbonation. Fruity, sweet flavor - mildly acidic. Finishes up crisp, spicy and lightly bitter
Church Brew Halberts Saison;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Church Brew Works;Draft at CBW. Pours a lovely golden with white head, as expected. Aroma is as expected for the style, mostly stewed malts and spices. I don’t know where they come up with tomatoes. The body of this goes against every other saison I have ever had. Starts traditional citrus and spice but quickly turns very, very harsh with alcohol and lemon peel. This really put me off, I haven’t had many but I’ve had some of the best and I would consider it one of my more favorite styles.
Church Brew Halberts Saison;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Church Brew Works;YUCK! Worst saison I’ve ever had. Aroma was plastic with metal. Pour was a dirty light brown with no bubbles and no head. Taste was stale bubble bath with the yeast and spices coming through in the aftertaste. Little to no carbonation. Each sip was a struggle.
Church Brew Halberts Saison;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Church Brew Works;On tap in the Church. Glass held a cloudy gold/amber body with little to no head. Understated aromas of butterscotch and grain. Flavor starts off with a fairly buttery and sweet malt presence that the gives way to spice and yeast which covers a little bit of a metallic edge. I sure though this was awful at first, but it seemed to get better the longer it sat out.

Church Brew Halberts Saison;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Church Brew Works;Slightly hazy but otherwise typical pale yellow american lager color. Beery aroma and perhaps it has a little spice in there too. Medium mild carbonation. Taste is also a bit spicey like a wheat beer or american hefe.

Magpie Dark Secret;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Mild Ale;Magpie Brewery;"Cask at the Lincolnshire Poacher, Nottingham. This seems more like a brown ale than a mild to me; it’s medium to dark brown, not black. The flavours are dominated by roast without much of the soft fruit flavours I like in a mild.

Pours a murky brown color; off-white head with patchy retention. Light brown sugar and vanilla extract in the aroma. Medium mouthfeel: very weak rendition of a barrel-aged beer; decent roasted malt porter character, but with oak chips making themselves apparent (cardboard) and an overuse of something that seems like vanilla extract (although it’s evidently actual vanilla beans).

Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;Quite bland for a pale ale. More like a lager or Pilsner for how clear it is.
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;Tap @ the brewery. Light gold with minimal head. Subtle malt and spicy hop aromas. Clean, citrusy, spicy Saaz hops. Refreshing. A pale ale? More like a pilsner.
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;Tasted 8/3/2014. Draught at Mudgee Brewing, Mudgee, NSW. Poured a clear pale golden colour with a one-finger white frothy head that diminished quickly to a collar. Laced poorly. Carbonation moderate consisting of large bubbles. Aroma very subtly of floral hops. Taste with slight bitterness - more pilsner-like than pale ale. Light body. Smooth, crisp with slight bitterness. Poor for a pale ale.
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;330ml Bottle- A rather bland beer..................................................
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;A-- Poured a hazy straw yellow color. Huge head to start and quickly died down to under one finger. Good head retention on swirl as it went back to massive status. Did not die as quickly after swirling. Small beads of carbonation on the sides of the glass. Some bands of thick lacing on the sides. S-- Very faint hop smell. I got lemon, apple and bubblegum in the smell. Not at all what I was expecting. No real crispness to this at all. T-- Lots of lemon in the font. Sort of a dishwater type lemon. Different. M-- Back end holds some grassy notes. Get some fresh cut grass feel to this. Still a lot of lemon. Very carbonated. D-- No real malt to speak of. Very lemon driven. Low ABV at 4.4% but would get tired of this quickly. One dimensional and on the dull side.
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;330ml bottle. Pours a hazy medium gold, with a large white head, which lasts well and leaves some lace. Hints of floral hops mingle with stronger citrus notes in the aroma, as well as some white bread malt. Quite strong fruity and floral hops introduce the beer, leading into a fairly bland body, with white bread malt and a slight fruity sweetness. Mild floral hops reappear in the finish. This is just another of the crowd of pale ales that have flooded the Australian beer market of late. It’s not the worst of them by any stretch, but it certainly isn’t the best either. It’s simply a bland, inoffensive pale ale.
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;Really overcarbed, half a glass of foam which eventually settled. Crystal clear beer, very pale yellow, looks good. Quite like the aroma, spicy floral/citrus. Flavour is a little sour for my taste with a strange tang to it, mouthfeel lean and a bit harsh, could do with a bit more body to it. Promising up front but not to my taste in the end.
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;was quite light and watery, not much to it flavour wise. the spring beer from mudgee was much nicer
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;330ml bottle. Extremely light and pale yellow in colour with a rocky head of crisp deep white foam. Looks watery with lemon aroma that hides a hint of salty water. Lacks flavour and depth.
Mudgee Pale Ale;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mudgee Brewing Company;Oh no. This beer had nothing going for it. Blanched yellow colour, flat. Sour smell, although no infection. Watery mouthfeel. No discernable bitterness. Maybe some very faint malt flavour, or am I imagining that? Give it a miss.

Mudgee Porter;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Porter;Mudgee Brewing Company;Tap @ the brewery. Black with a brown tinge around the edges. Milk chocolate aromas. Chocolate, followed by coffee and some roasted malts. A little light in the mouth, lacking complexity from roasty malt and hops.
Mudgee Porter;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Porter;Mudgee Brewing Company;Tasted 8/3/2014. Draught at Mudgee Brewing, Mudgee, NSW. Poured a translucent deep ruby red with virtually no head. Aroma subtly and nicely of roasted grains/malts. Tasted with slightly sweet malt that was quickly followed by a tart, citrus/lemon acidic sourness - terrible! Lighter body than I’d expect from a porter. Indescribable finish!! Very poor.
Mudgee Porter;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Porter;Mudgee Brewing Company;Bottle from Plonk. Something wrong here. Smelled ok, bit of roast/coffee, but tasted quite sour/acidic. Infected? Bad batch?
Mudgee Porter;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Porter;Mudgee Brewing Company;Pours with excessive carbonation, looks the business with black body and creamy head. Starts with coffee and chocolate notes which are quickly overtaken by a bizzare tangy/lemony taste. Was unusual in the wheat beer but just wrong in a porter, if I got this taste in my hombrew I’d start looking for an infection!!
Mudgee Porter;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Porter;Mudgee Brewing Company;Almost a complete replica of Tooheys old in my opinion. Some coffee flavours but other than that, a pretty bad beer.
Mudgee Porter;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Porter;Mudgee Brewing Company;330ml bottle. Pours an almost completely opaque black, with the merest flash of chestnut. A huge beige head lasts very well, leaving decent lacing. Whilst it thus looks very promising, the beer is not anywhere near as good as it looks. The aroma is quite weak, although there are traces of dark chocolate and some less inspiring grainy notes. The initial flavour is one of extremely intense, high-cocoa dark chocolate, which is quite overpowering. This develops into a quite acidic lemon flavour, which dominates right through the finish. This over-strong flavour combination is not precisely pleasant, and nor is it even vaguely similar to any other porter I have tasted. I would recommend giving this one a miss.
Mudgee Porter;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Porter;Mudgee Brewing Company;From a 330ml bottle on 15/10/2011. Pours brown/black with a massive head to begin. Has a mild aroma of chocolate and a bit of fruit. Tastes unusual. While there are typical chocolate and roasty notes, there’s a distinct fruitiness to it, with raspberry particularly prominent. It’s let down by the palate, with a thin texture and too much carbonation. A bit confused and not a particularly good porter.
Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;Sweet fruit candy aroma. Murky yellow colour over primed head and lacing. Malt candy sweet fruit flavour. Fizzy palate.

Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;Tasted 8/3/2014. Draught at Mudgee Brewing, Mudgee, NSW.

Taste dominated by cloves with no/low bitterness. Light body. Smooth finish dominated by cloves. OK
Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;An average wheat beer with the standard banana and fruit flavours but with such a tangy/ tart aftertaste, it ruins any possible enjoyment. Has the excessive carbonation that seems to be a hall mark of Mudgee beers.
Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;From the bottle, a real pale straw colour. Plenty of carbonation. Interesting sweet aromas that I struggle to describe, some banana and bubblegum perhaps? Smooth but a tad thin mouth-feel, easy drinking. This is a good beer, good summer day quaffer.
Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;From a 330ml bottle on 13/11/2010. Not a bad attempt at a hefe. Has a slightly odd aroma with some sharpness over the banana. The carbonation is good. Is reasonably sweet and has quite refreshing lemony tang. No world beater but quite drinkable.
Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;330ml bottle. Pours immensely pale straw colour with a good carbonation that leads to an uprising of bubbles that form a thick creamy white foam blanket. Cloudy as you would expect with clove and bubblegum aromas wafting through. Flavour is sweet and zippy on the palate. Not bad but not great either.
Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;Bottle. Sort of an odd one. Had a more hoppy pilsenery feel, but then the thick texture and banana lolly taste reminded me it was a wheat beer. Good maltiness, and goes down well with a cheese plate.
Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;I thought this was an American Style Wheat when I first tried it because mine was almost completely devoid of cloves/banana. It definitely had the sourness I’d expect but too dry to balance it out properly. Head was good and hung around a little while. Mellowed a little after a while but the tartness was just a little too much for me.
Mudgee Wheat;Mudgee, NSW, Australia;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Mudgee Brewing Company;Aroma: some funk with a hint of clove. Flavour: actually a decent mix of a little banana with clove and sweet malt.

Windie Goat The Dubh Porter;Mauchline, Scotland;Porter;Windie Goat Brewery;2nd December 2009 Pigs Ear. Clear dark brown beer. Neutral palate but very low carbonation. Well balanced dark malt with some peachy orange hop coming through, not bitter. Not bad.
Windie Goat The Dubh Porter;Mauchline, Scotland;Porter;Windie Goat Brewery;Sampled this porter at the Paisley Beer Festival April 2007. Cask, gravity dispense. Mahogany black in colour with a creamy white head. Strong roast malt aroma with slight chocolate overtones.

Dry dusty hop resin in aftertaste with a vinous winey fruit in the finish. A decent session porter.

Old Bear Duke Of Bronte Capstan FS;Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Old Bear Brewery;Bottle passed onto me by Jan, consumed 02.11.11 Cheers Jan! Pours orange/amber no head, as flat as a careless hedgehog. I hated this at first, it was not my thing at all but I forgot about it whilst I had a couple of glasses of apple juice with me tea, I then went back to it and it was better. Its really fruity, I cannot believe it is a double IPA I can barely taste a hop, a twang of sourness, sweet and sour but not horrid sour, quite thick in the mouth and strangely moreish. Everything about this beer suggests I should sling it down the sink, but I can’t it has a very strange appeal, its not what it appears to be, its just a weird fruity, non bitter, non hoppy mess, but an ok mess.

Old Bear Duke Of Bronte Capstan FS;Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Old Bear Brewery;1st January 2008 Gold beer, slightly dusty looking. Overwhelming smoke followed by an odd mix of hop bitterness, sweetness and more smoke. Horrible!

Old Bear Duke Of Bronte Capstan FS;Keighley, West Yorkshire, England;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Old Bear Brewery;Bottle, 12.5%. Farty aroma, quite cheesy. Rather cloudy dark orange colour. No head. The flavour is sour, has a bit of the same cheese as the aroma. A bit of smoke in the aftertaste. A very special beer, and that is not meant positively.

Brewzzi Belgian White;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Brewzzi Microbrewery;Draft... Mostly clear, straw-colored ale with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Decent retention. Spicy nose with notes of dry wheat malt and plenty of coriander and orange peel. The wheaty flavor bends toward the bitter side of balance and is slightly spicy and a tad fruity. Medium-bodied with a 2%-milk mouthfeel and prickly carbonation. Lengthy, lightly bitter finish. I just plain don’t like 90% of the wits I try, but this is definitely one of the better wits I’ve ever tasted!
Fitzpatrick Winery Celtic Cider;Fair Play, California, United States;Apple Cider;Fitzpatrick Winery;2001 Vintage. Bottle purchased at the Davis, CA Farmer’s Market. Aroma is apple-like with some light mustiness as well as some sweet honey-like aroma retronasally. I almost detect a little mead-like aroma. Appealing aroma, nonetheless. Transparent pale golden body with a spritzy, light bubbled whitish head that dissipates quickly and leaves a nice white lacing. Start is very tart and carbonated. There are some light apple flavors present, but this becomes quite dry and a bit ethanolic. Finish tastes exactly like pimento olives/pimento olive juice. Definitely a unique cider. I am not horrifically familiar with Gravenstein apples, nor am I familiar with 5+ year old ciders. This just kind of lacks a lot of the apple character and flavor. It is definitely unique. I personally this it is ok (because I don’t mind the olive flavor), but I can see this not being enjoyable to some people.
De Molen Opdondertje;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottle, 5.7%. Malty, citric, quite yeasty aroma. Sparkling, slightly hazy golden colour, getting quite cloudy, muddy, milky and chunky towards the bottom. Big stable rocky white head. The flavour is mild, a little citrus.

Bottle foamed out when uncapped. Poured slightly hazy gold with an enormous bubbly head and decent lacing. There is a strong yeasty aroma with very mild hops.

De Molen Opdondertje;Bodegraven, Netherlands;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Brouwerij De Molen (Swinkels Family Brewers);Bottle. [thank you, Skortila!] Pours a hazy light yellow with a giant creamy fluffy white head. Aroma has a creamyness and a herbal grassy hops note. Okay mouthfeel.

Browarmia Karmazynowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;Not too shabby spiced beer, though rather on the watery side. The gingerbready aroma with notes of ginger and coriander is interesting but ultimately the beer is bland and forgettable.
Browarmia Karmazynowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;30cl from tap (as Crimson) at the brewpub. Gingery aroma with malt, caramel and hints of spices. Medium to light body with average carbonation. Medium sweet with a light bitterness in the finish. Okay ginger beer, but s bit weak. (2013-05-03)
Browarmia Karmazynowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;Es riecht interessant: Sehr Würzig => Gewürzig. Farblich bräunlich, rötlich, Schaumkrone gut.

Hazy darker amber to brown coloured beer with no carbonation and a medium off white head. Light sweet fruity and malty hinted aroma. Medium palate.

Browarmia Karmazynowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;Called Karmazynowe (crimson), this is BrowArmia’s ginger ale. Hazy brown body, reveals some red amber in the light. Fluffy white head. Aroma sweet malty, spiciness, coriander seeds with only light touches of ginger. Flavour of malts, caramel, spices, moderate hints of bitter ginger. Subtle hops. Supposedly brewed with Polish hops. OK for the hot Warsaw summer. (Draught @ BrowArmia brewpub, Warsaw, summer 2010)
Browarmia Karmazynowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;Draft at 4.8% ABV. A hazy dark amber beer with a lazing off-white head. The aroma has strong notes of ginger on a malty, caramel back ground. The flavor has strong notes of ginger, combined with medium notes of malt and caramel, leading to a dry ginger finish. The body is thin. I’m not a ginger beer lover. Should be listed as a Spice/herb/vegetable beer.
Browarmia Karmazynowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;Draught at Browarmia, Warszawa. Unclear brown with head that diminished. Caramel malt and citrus aroma and taste. Lingering bitterness in the finish.

Browarmia Karmazynowe;Warszawa, Poland;Flavored - Other;Browarmia Krolewska;"""Crimson ale"". Cola colour, big white head. Butterscotch aroma, salty buttery caramel and some vanilla in the air...

Nicely made and clean. Decent.
Svatý Norbert Pšenièné;Prague, Czech Republic;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Klášterní Pivovar Strahov;Keg at The Great British Beer Festival 2017, Kensington Olympia. Very full aroma of cloves, yeast, bread, orange and peach. Flavour is similar, if a little lighter.
Svatý Norbert Pšenièné;Prague, Czech Republic;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Klášterní Pivovar Strahov;Draft. Inviting glowing gold with a foamy head. Lemon citrus, slightly acidic in the finish, some honey in there too. Would have liked some banana to make this a top hefeweizen, but still pretty damn good.

Glentworth Bramling Gem;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Glentworth Brewery;(Gravity) Golden with no head. Toffee and chocolate aromas. A bit thin, but otherwise OK on the palate. Bitter-sweet finish.
Slater's Franks Thirst;Stafford, Staffordshire, England;Stout;Slater's Ales;Dark ruby-brown in appearance with a foamy head. Scent is of oranges. Very very bitter with lots of roasted hop and a touch of blackberry. Thick and alive on the palate. Very good.

Sweet and soft with whipped cream maltiness and sugar on top. A bit fruity and sonmewhat salty with some light caramel. Low on hops, yet some resin comes through in the finish.
Eipeltauer Öfneinzg (1190);Wien, Austria;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Eipeltauer Privatbrauerei;Draught, 5.5% at the brewpub as Eipeltauer Märzen. The brewer shook my hand when I walked in, but did not seem keen to adapt his German to a foreign ear. Nice, fellow, though. Hazy chestnut colour. Good stable creamy tan head. Good malt flavour, slightly sweet. Low to medium bitterness, sneaking in towards the late finish, sligthly rough. Creamy carbonation. Very drinkable.
Eipeltauer Öfneinzg (1190);Wien, Austria;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Eipeltauer Privatbrauerei;Draught at the brewery. Light sweet, malty aroma. Dark golden, light orange color. Foamy head. Beer is few malty, very light sweet. Light grainy, dry herbal hop bitterness. Lght fruity. Long dry, light herbal finish. A bit too much hop, as i would expect.

Bruuveri Bastard of Rye;Helsinki, Finland;IPA;Panimoravintola Bruuveri;Draught@SOPP 2007 Hazy dark nut brown color, small and mostly vanishing off-white head. Strong American style hops and yeast in the nose. Quite flat mouthfeel. Nice hoppy bite, which starts slightly sweetish and ryeish but evolves to long bitter finish. Good IPA, I would say that this has some influence from late Stadin Panimo ..
Bruuveri Bastard of Rye;Helsinki, Finland;IPA;Panimoravintola Bruuveri;Draught. Hazy dark brown colour, small white head. Aroma of rye bread! A bit watery and too hoppy, lacking balance. Original though.
Bruuveri Bastard of Rye;Helsinki, Finland;IPA;Panimoravintola Bruuveri;(Draught@SOPP, Helsinki) Very murky dark amber-brown with a small, bubbly head. Sweetish, rye-malty aroma with hints of licorice and flowery-aromatic hops. Strongly hoppy (British-style, quite similar to Special London Ale) flavor with ryebready maltiness. Long, bitter and dryish finish. Medium-bodied, bitter palate with medium carbonation. Not quite as refined as the best Nordic brews, but surprisingly pleasant, tasty and balanced for a Finnish one.
Okhotsk Ale;Kitami-shi, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Okhotsk Beer;Draught at the Craft Beer Festival in Ichinoseki, Iwate. Nice copper color with a thin, fine head. Amber malt aroma, fruity. Rich amber malt flavor, slightly fruity, dry finish. Decent hop burn later. Easy-drinking, refreshing, good finish. Not so interesting, though.
Okhotsk Ale;Kitami-shi, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Okhotsk Beer;Deep amber color, pale malt and ringwood yeast in nose. Thin body of cherries and wood. Off dry finish.
Okhotsk Ale;Kitami-shi, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Okhotsk Beer;"My Bottom Line: This unclassifiable session ale promotes earthy hops atop meager fruity caramel maltiness. Its bubbly effervescence overwhelms the frail body, and increases the resemblance to soda, but in the end it remains well-crafted if not forgettable. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circumspects the clear orange-tinted copper. -Body isn’t exactly anemic, but it’s definitely on the thin side of things. -The hop bitterness is wooden and firm. Bottle; thx Tim!"
Glentworth Centenniale;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Cask & Cutler, Sheffield 07/04/2007 Citrus and hop aromas. Small white head.

Cannon Royall Black Star;Honeybourne, Worcestershire, England;Stout;Cannon Royall Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Cask & Cutler, Sheffield 07/04/2007 Roast and fruit aromas. Beige head. Black slightly rich on the palate and smooth with some sweetness. A little bitterness in a full burnt roast finish.

Iwate Kura Miyabi Lager;Ichinoseki-Shi, Iwate Prefecture, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Sekinoichi Shuzo (Iwate Kura Beer);My Bottom Line: This Premium Lager’s tandem of honeyed maltiness and subtle yet lingering spicy hops conjures up a clean, well-brewed, and satisfying session beer. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam blankets the clear blond. -This is superbly fed for the style, perhaps the beer’s finest feature. -The nose is timid for what the flavor profile has to offer. -Carbonation sustains the body and flavor perfectly. -This is nothing special, but it serves its purpose admirably well. On tap at The Aldgate.
Shirayuki Citras;Itami, Hyogo, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Konishi Brewing Company;On tap at Craft Beer Holiday. Konishi Citras  A very very pale gold with a filmy white head. A very lemony aroma with wheat cake maltiness. The taste is a candyish lemon, almost like a lemon alcopop. Nice enough.
Shirayuki Citras;Itami, Hyogo, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Konishi Brewing Company;"330 ml bottle from Seijo Ishii @ Todoroki, Tokyo. Does not say ""Shirayuki"" on the bottle but only on my receipt - so probably this is the same drink. Limited summer edition, 4,5% alcohol, several different fruits listed as ingredients. Pours very pale, white, even too white fizzy foam that leaves soon, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. Carbonation not too bad, some bubbles rising to the top even several minutes after the pour. Aroma is citrus candy, orange peel and pineapple, lemonade - no hops, almost no malt. Grapefruit dominates the taste, leaving some bready malt notes lingering in the aftertaste. I guess that’s the only place you can understand this is actually beer. OK, also the foam tasted a bit of grains. Otherwise this drink reminds me mainly some ""innovative"" beer cocktails from home - something that is fine to try once to understand this is not really a beer."
Shirayuki Citras;Itami, Hyogo, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Konishi Brewing Company;Very pale golden color. Pineapples, pink grapefruit, oranges and chemical nose. Sweet sour mouth pineapples. Light. WOW a baccardi breezer that is a beer!
Shirayuki Citras;Itami, Hyogo, Japan;Flavored - Fruit;Konishi Brewing Company;"My Bottom Line: This fizzy lemon soda does not deserve to be called beer. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam disappears into the clear, very pale yellow. -The nose forewarns of this cooler-emulating beer. -At least the citrusy fruitiness is long. -The zesty flavors are straightforward and the whole thing is clean, but there is a serious lack of cereals here, even though they advertise wheat as an important ingredient. Bottle; thx Tim!"
Nikko Beer (Amber);Nikko, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Nikko Brewing;"courtesy of Toni Flükiger - hazy reddish-orange colour with a firm off-white foam; the nose is slightly madereized and shows some notes of almonds and flowers; creamy mouthfeel and medium-bodied; quite highly carbonated and with a short grainy and honeyish finish - weird"
Nikko Beer (Amber);Nikko, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Nikko Brewing;"My Bottom Line: Its many toasted malts produce a comfortable body within which spicy, citrusy hops quietly wake up. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam dissipates into the dark amber. -This tastes very similar to their blond; perhaps the same base beer with the addition of some darker malts? -The soft effervescence works with the showcased maltiness. -Nothing spectacular here, although it is more flavorful than their vapid blond. -Note that the label only says ""Nikko Beer"", but this is definitely not the same beer as the blond ""Nikko Beer"". Bottle; best before August 1st (had on June 22nd). Thx Tim!"
Kelham Island Good Bye Girl;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kelham Island Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Fat Cat, Sheffield 07/04/2007 Hoppy and floral aromas.

Swan Lake Rye Ale;Sasakamimura, Kitakanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Hyouko Yashiki No Mori Brewery (Swan Lake);5%. Faints whiffs of spicy rye and generic malt from a good pull on the nose. Very malt accentuated beer, but fair play, it’s not listed a s a pale ale. The rye presence is not too spry and this makes for a fairly generic ale, bordering on lager territory. Really needs something to punch it up.
Swan Lake Rye Ale;Sasakamimura, Kitakanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Hyouko Yashiki No Mori Brewery (Swan Lake);On tap at Popeye, Tokyo. Hazy, pale golden with almost no head. Spicy aroma that combines with fruity flavours. Well-balanced. Very refreshing and with good complexity.
Swan Lake Rye Ale;Sasakamimura, Kitakanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Hyouko Yashiki No Mori Brewery (Swan Lake);On tap at Craft Beer Bar. Had this beer towards the end of the night and in retrospect, perhaps it should have been the first. Colour was very a very nice radiant glowing orange with golden bubbles cascading upward into a small, creamy off white head. Taste certainly contained it’s share of rye but overall this was just sort of...there. It was good, but didn’t blow me away.
Swan Lake Rye Ale;Sasakamimura, Kitakanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Hyouko Yashiki No Mori Brewery (Swan Lake);Aroma: light malt, rye, hops. Dainty and spicy. Fruity, light, slightly spicy flavor. Nicely hopped as well. The rye works—it is light, crisp, a bit weak tasting but refined: dainty and subtle. I don’t really like it, but it is very interesting and well done.
Swan Lake Rye Ale;Sasakamimura, Kitakanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Hyouko Yashiki No Mori Brewery (Swan Lake);Deep golden with a white head. Lightly spiced aroma with plenty of fruits and malts. The ry makes a brief appearance in the flavor but I didn’t find it to be all that noticeable. The fresh fruit flavor was much stronger. Really tasty beer but I wish the rye was more intense.
Swan Lake Rye Ale;Sasakamimura, Kitakanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Hyouko Yashiki No Mori Brewery (Swan Lake);"My Bottom Line: This light yet flavorful Golden Ale knows how to keep the tastebuds busy with its citrus-laced cereals and spicy hop lengths. Not a world beater by any means, but another quality Swan Lake product nonetheless. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the hazy pale golden beige. -Soft carbonation and lean maltiness create an elegant mouthfeel. -Very drinkable, flavorful and light, this makes a satisfying session beer, I’m sure. Bottle; thx Tim!"
Swan Lake Rye Ale;Sasakamimura, Kitakanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Specialty Grain - Other;Hyouko Yashiki No Mori Brewery (Swan Lake);The deep golden brew really lets the rye shine through. The nose and mouth really put the grain on display, while the hops take a backseat, but not to a bit of wild lemon zest. I like how they made this beer. I just wish it was easier to find.
Daisen G Beer Imperial Stout;Tottori Prefecture, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Daisen G Beer;Bottle. Pours near black, highlights, great tan head and lacing. Roasty aroma, charred malts, soy, rich chocolate, savoury. Pleasing bold malt flavour, rich with an umami character, raisin, soy. Nicely carbonated, smooth body but not creamy, moderate body flows over the palate well, long bitter finish. Really quite good.
Daisen G Beer Imperial Stout;Tottori Prefecture, Japan;Stout - Imperial;Daisen G Beer;Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, frothy head. Smell is dominated by a mild tart cherry aroma, with underlying notes of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste follows the nose, with that tart cherry note being a little too present despite lighter notes of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and a certain light herbal/earthy hoppiness. Finishes with a light bitterness and that tart cherry note lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. Based on the other reviews, I'm gonna go ahead and call this one infected, although it's really not *that* bad. That tart cherry note is not unbearable if you can appreciate a tart cherry/raspberry porter and there are still some underlying roasted malt and chocolate/coffee notes that prevent this from being a total drainpour, but yeah, there is clearly something wrong with this.

Nose has clean aromas of malt, hint of booze, hops...what is typically described as “beery”. DMS in the nose which is not unpleasant or inappropriate for this style. Maybe a hint of acetaldehyde “green apple” on first approach but I could be wrong. Mouthfeel is very watered honey. So it’s not a light mouthfeel. Not quite juicy since that would be inappropriate. Palate has flavors of honey, honeyed water biscuts, light cracker, wheat toast, light grain flavor suggesting cold cereal. Hop flavors are wood, mint, accentuated by a slightly spicy cedar sappy favor character. Finish is medium with sweet, boozy flavors riding on the bitter which is a sappy, woody bitter. Overall, a surprisingly refreshing, balanced, clean, tasty strong lager.

Nagahama Ibuki Weizen;Nagahama, Shiga, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Nagahama Roman Beer;My Bottom Line: This half Weizen, half Blond Ale’s biscuity maltiness and herbal hop bitterness supercede its banana esters and citrusy zest, but fear not: it remains quite drinkable and pleasurable. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam surfs the hazy yellow blond. -The prickly effervescence is a little too forthcoming for my tastes. -This is not your textbook Weizen, so that’s fun. -It’s cleanly-brewed and well-structured, just maybe not the recipe that’ll impress you. On tap at Towers.
Nagahama Ibuki Weizen;Nagahama, Shiga, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Nagahama Roman Beer;Slightly hazy golden color. Very clovey with what reminded me of banana cream pie, though the bananas were not so strong. Not as balanced as I hoped. A cream pie finish.

Clean and very drinkable. Good stuff.
Swan Lake Brown Ale;Sasakamimura, Kitakanbara-gun, Niigata-ken, Japan;Brown Ale;Hyouko Yashiki No Mori Brewery (Swan Lake);My Bottom Line: This semi-Brown Ale satisfies with its lenient hazelnut and caramel maltiness within a lean body, but somewhat disappoints due to its forgettable finish and lack of direction. Further Personal Perceptions: -A screen of foam sinks into the orangey copper(?!). -Some roastiness dries out a part of the caramel maltiness. -The quiet carbonation helps drinkability. -Hops are of no consequence, and the yeast is somewhat clumsy. -This Brown Ale is definitely on the way to Amber Ale territory. Bottle.

Korikori no Kuni Alt;Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Hida Korikori Beer;Light caramel aroma, mild caramel colour with thin head. Flavour is also initially caramel sweetness that moves to a very pleasant and long finish with a hint of bitterness. Balance and carbonation are spot on. Drinking this in Takayama and I wonder if some other tasters have suffered from poor handling internationally. The guys in the shop I bought in locally in Takayama packed it with dry ice so it didn’t suffer shock from cold to warm to cold again!
Korikori no Kuni Alt;Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Hida Korikori Beer;Bottle from the brewpub. Dry, minerally aroma, light caramel, not very rich. Nice cloudy amber with a fine, low head. Light, dry flavor, caramel and minerals, quite surprising bitterness. A bit thin and watery, with a slight tang as well.

Korikori no Kuni Alt;Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Hida Korikori Beer;Bottle. Light amber colour with a small froth. Fruity caramel aroma, hints of honey. Complex, spicy and honeyish caramel flavours. Rather flat, a bit watery. Complex and quite impressive.
Korikori no Kuni Alt;Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Hida Korikori Beer;My Bottom Line: Moderate caramel maltiness disappoints in its lacks of certainty and complexity, and tired grassy hops fall asleep before the sip ends. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sticky head of foam decorates the glass atop the palest amber. -The aroma does not announce much in the way of pleasure. -This again tastes like 3.5%-4% alcohol. -The low carbonation and weary maltiness bring this beer close to water. -Served nearly frozen, and this thin, you can quickly tell that this beer is not trying to impress the craft beer lover. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Korikori no Kuni Norikura;Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hida Korikori Beer;Bottle. Clear yellow - white head. Soapy, crispy, hay, light malty, dryness, straw, cactus, light wheaty, light bitterness. OK.

Korikori no Kuni Norikura;Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hida Korikori Beer;My Bottom Line: This frail Weizen’s feeble banana esters and watery, thin body are thankfully pervaded by citrusy wheat flavors. A cleanly-brewed, soporific recipe like their 2 other beers that day. Further Personal Perceptions: -There is great lacing atop the very pale straw white. -Again, this was served nearly frozen! -The finish is dry and mineral, almost Perrier-like. -It’s so watery, alcohol percentage must be below 4%. On tap at the brewery restaurant.

Hakusekikan Tennenhachimitsukoubou Shizen Bakushu;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Sampled on 10/15/2011. This golden ale light gold blond color from a 330ml bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head. The aroma is fruity and sweet, and a touch funky. A medium to light bodied golden ale. The malts are fruity and sweet with a touch of funk. The hops are earthy and herbal. Decent carbonation. A slight touch of funk. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Hakusekikan Tennenhachimitsukoubou Shizen Bakushu;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Now this is an interesting beer. Had a quality that was hard to put my finger on, maybe tart, but definately lively. The nose was interesting too. This brewery is always interesting
Hakusekikan Tennenhachimitsukoubou Shizen Bakushu;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Draught at Eni-brau, Osaka. Light copper color with a lace head. Aroma of honey, sweet malts, caramel. Fruity flavor with honey, caramel and a touch of chocolate. Medium hop bitterness throughout. Smooth and oil palate, medium body. The finish is clean, bitter, and long. A very interesting beer, well balanced and tasty.
Hakusekikan Tennenhachimitsukoubou Shizen Bakushu;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;On tap at Beer & Bear, Osaka. Hazy peach golden with a small froth. Refreshing fruity caramel aroma. Orange zest flavours, good offsetting spices, ending dry. Grainy mouthfeel. A refreshing Belgian-style saison.
Hakusekikan Tennenhachimitsukoubou Shizen Bakushu;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;Hay colored with little head. The aroma starts out with spices and sweet malts moving on to smoke and yeast with a touch of honey. Nice body, easy to drink. No smoke in the flavor, but the spices and yeast notes make their presence known. Some fruits along with banana and sweet malts. A nice beer, hard to imagine drinking more than one at a time.
Hakusekikan Tennenhachimitsukoubou Shizen Bakushu;Ena-gun, Gifu, Japan;Sour / Wild Beer;Hakusekikan Beer/Stone Iwamoto Co.;My Bottom Line: The intrinsic floral character of the wild honey yeast works wonders with the various citrusy pale fruit engendered by the hop bite. This is another unique Wild Ale from Toshi Niwa, Hakusekikan’s ale and yeast wizard. Further Personal Perceptions: -Nearly headless, the golden shine is nonetheless appealing. -The wild yeast is tamer than their Shizen Bakushu, whose yeast comes from the air. -The bottled sample was quite thinner than that taken from the lagering tank, where it was creamy and more seductive. -Hakusekikan beers seem to all have a floral character of their own which is truly appealing. -While this is nowhere near as mesmerizing as the Shizen Bakushu, it is entirely unique and a wonderful session ale. From the lagering tank, from the bottle, and on tap at Beer and Bear.

Kyoto Machiya Kölsch (Gosho);Kyoto, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Kinshi Masamune Sake / Kyoto Machiya Beer;On tap at the brewpub in Kyoto, it poured a nice pale gold with a thin white head. The aroma is one of slightly sweet malt, the taste is a bit rough followed by some sweetness and a dry bitter finish. It wasn’t bad but it’s pretty average for a Kolsch. I did find it hit the spot after biking to the brewpub from my place on a sunny day.

Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;Bottled at RBJG park session. Looks like soy sauce, but with more head. Smells like soy sauce, butwith grassy hops underneath.Surprisingly slim with lots of roasty flavours. Salty, but with low hop rate and long caramelly finish. A very unusual beer.
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;Rather faint aroma of sour apples, hops, earthy caramel. Dark brown with a huge tan head. Burnt flavor,with slightly sour apples, caramel, almost no maltose at all. Rather sour as well. A little more caramel and a touch of sweetness came out as it warmed. Very earthy, bitter hop finish with burnt sugar. This is certainly a very original tasting beer. Can’t say I much care for it, but interesting as hell.
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;A beautiful dark beer. Listed as an iPA more like a strong ale. A JSA perhaps? You really have to try it on tap. THe bottle doesn’t do it justice although in saying that it is a great ale in any form. Truly unique and worthy of repeat status
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;"A bizarre Japanese take on English Strong Ale that misses the mark by a country mile and yet is still utterly fascinating. A real headscratcher, this one. It shouldn’t work and yet somehow it does. It looks much as it should - classic English-ale brown with a fair head. But the aroma announces that this is going to be something unusual. It’s herbaceous, floral, rich with golden syrup sugars and quite unlike any other ale I’ve sniffed. Oily body with muted carbonation. The flavours are vegetal, which should be disastrous and yet isn’t. ""Mossy"", suggested Linc, and I can’t improve on that. My notes say, ""green"", ""primeval"", ""flower beds"" and ""Brussel sprouts"", which sounds ghastly, yet I rated it 7/10 for flavour. All in all, this is a very quirky ale. (Bottle courtesy of TimE at Sull""s 2007 Xmas RB gathering - thanks to both)"
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;Bottle, cgarvieuk coolbeans party. Golden chestnut, thin offwhite head. Under-ripe pineapple, rice and coconut dominate the nose. Mouth is coconut, pineapple, plastic, rice and hop. Finishes hop/malt balance, slightly peppery malts. No alcohol, garlic salt. Bizarre, but definitely something I’d have again.
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;Bottle at home with Tom ... pineaple fresh coconut nose ... odd there something i really like about it but cant quite get what it is ... light sweet interesiting ... i think Toms right with ,some mangetout in this . wow, i know ive not really described it and done it justice, but its real interesting and unusual. I recomend you check this out.
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;Bottle at cgarvieuk’s shack of party banter. Aroma is cucumber thats been stored in water in the fridge, freshly smashed coconut flesh, hints of lemongrass spice, Taste is like a grassy hay kind of cucumber peppery like mangetout, mini corn stir fry, perhaps even the freshness of wasabi. My god what a strange beer, no alc to been seen.
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;Woody toffee in the nose with slightly medicinal herbs. Tawny color with a quickly fading tan head. Fruity and woody. Old leather and bitter herbs. Notes of tarragon and burnt toffee with a vegatal bitterness behind it all. Finishes with a bit of alcohol heat and mulled fruit.
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;Deep, clear amber with a medium, full head. Aroma is sweet fruits, malty, some spice, and finally hops. Smooth, full body. Flavor is fairly malty, fruits, bready, grapefruit. Finish is tangy. The alcohol never shows itself. Nice ale, a little too bready for me, but solid.
Ikiiki Taiko Ale;Himi-Shi, Toyama-Ken, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Ikiiki Ji Beer-Bier Reise;(Nov 05) A clear, dark amber colored brew with a smallish tan head. A mild spicy hop scent, some pine but not overpowering, cardamom pods come to mind. Smooth feel, lightly carbonated. A tangy hop flavor with a touch of coppery, mineral saltiness. A very traditional British style. Just a touch of sweetness in the middle but still the tangy mineral salt taste is there, like sections of grapefruit dipped in salt but mild. A tasty follow and a mild bittersweet finish. What a pleasant find in bland lager land!
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;Can, brought back from Hokkaido by a friend. Thanks! Has an aroma of grain, corn, and light grass. Clear gold straw color. Light grass, grain, corn, thin sweetish extract-like flavor. Thin, watery. Underattentuated. Like a home brew gone wrong.
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;On tap at Tsuki to Taiyo Brewing. Clear straw-gold with a nice big pillowy white head. Nose has some grass, wet grain, cheese and butter notes. Taste is grainy with some hop flavor coming out but as it warms it becomes like buttermilk. Diacetyl bomb.
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;Just another overpriced average omiyage pils. Basically drink it cold and quick or just don’t.
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;"350 ml can as ""Susukino Beer"" bought at CitySuper in New Town Plaza, Shatin during the Hokkaido Food Fair Promotion. Translucent dull golden colour; Razor thin head and residual white foam which fades in 10 seconds; Almost no lacing with some notable carbonation; Sweet smell of malt, with corn, grains, syrup and light grass; Light sweet taste of thinned malt, with grains, soda water, light bread, notes of grapefruit, lemon and light grass; Light body, watery palate; Mouth feel is a very watered down, bare-bone pils, pretty much like a macro pale, with customary corn and grain taste overwhelmed any residual malt. Duh! Hoppiness has some grapefruit but only appears as spikes and has no impact on overall poor taste. Low grass and barely tastable bitterness, poor grapefruit finish; Slightly dry after taste, very easy to mouth. Comments: This beer is a disaster - no head, overtly thinned, strong corn taste, and near zero bitterness - It reminds me of the pitiful Hong Kong Beer, and it reduced to a glass of turbid malt water is an ugly sight and not that tolerable for taste. Reading from previous reviews, it appears that Susukino’s glory days as a micro is long gone. Drain pours!"
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;This brewery is not closed, they shut-down their restaurant and stopped making anything but a standard lager which is sold in cans around Sapporo. It is aimed at tourists I guess with the can covered in photos of Sapporo. It poured a clear straw color with minimal head. I’d heard it sucked but it was quite drinkable. Sweet & easy to drink when straight from the fridge but it didn’t have a whole lot of flavor. When it warmed up some grassy notes came through. It’s an ok lager which is not what I want from a craft beer.
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;Can with the cute farm label. Warm peachy gold with slight haze and stable head. Sweet sprouted grain aroma. Soft palate. Sweet entry with peppery hop in the finish is quite nice.
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;Hazy straw, malt-accented aroma with paint or glue phenols. Bland, although is does have some fresh grains. Fairly soft body, but this boring stuff isn’t my can of beer.
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;Draught at the brewery, 2007. Decent malt and hop aromas, nice rounded, slightly buttery flavor in the Czech mold. Decent hopping and good flavor generally, a bit fruity. Nice beer, well balanced, though I was not as impressed this time as the first time I had it in the bottle! Can, 2012. Very sweet malts, too much diactyl, much less hop aroma and bitterness. Going downhill, it would seem, unless I just got a bad one... 6/3/6/3/13= 3.1
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;Found a can of this in a department store’s Sapporo spotlight bin. Poured a clear frothy golden colour. Taste was nice and malty with a nice distinct bite. The finish was somewhat abrupt, but the astyle is well represented here.
Susukino Pilsener;Sapporo, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Susukino Ji-Beer;12 oz can from hogfodder, who brought this one back from Japan, and shared it with after4ever and myself. Pour is clear golden with a smallish white head. Aroma of sweet rice and some maltiness. Taste is pretty flat and watery. Some of the hop floral comes through in the taste. Not bad just dull. Though its likely not in the cards, would love to try this on draft. Thanks for sharing, Rick.
Riverside Dixons Hoppy Yeaster;Skegness, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Riverside (Lincs) Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Wellington, Birmingham. Amber with white head. Dry and bitter beer without a lot of character, perhaps some woody, pencil flavour. Just a little unexiting.
Riverside Dixons Hoppy Yeaster;Skegness, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Riverside (Lincs) Brewery;Cask conditioned handpump Malt Shovel Northampton. A golden coloured beer with a whitish head and lacing. A non-descript aroma leads to a slight citrus taste in the mouth. It’s pretty unexciting and lacking depth.
Riverside Dixons Hoppy Yeaster;Skegness, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Riverside (Lincs) Brewery;Cask, handpump, at 2nd Wellington BF, Wellington Arms, Bedford. Not the worst beer of the festival, but definitely the worst pun. Dark coppery gold. Slight sulphur in the aroma and not much else. Taste is pleasantly malty with some sourness, followed closely by the promised hops. Overall effect is quite acceptable.
Riverside Dixons Hoppy Yeaster;Skegness, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Riverside (Lincs) Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Wellington, Birmingham 20/04/2007 Very hoppy and sulphurous aromas. Golden amber coloured hoppy and fruity with some alcohol present. Crisp and slightly bitter dry finish.
Maypole Little Weed;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Maypole Brewery;Cask at Hand & Heart, Nottingham. Definitely grassy tasting golden session ale
Maypole Little Weed;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Maypole Brewery;Cask Aroma grainy cereals and dough. Pours amber. Broken lace. Taste balanced with soured tea predominating. It’s better than it sounds with a lingering earthiness. This is the standard bitter here which I have ignored amidst the rapidly changing guest list. It isn’t bad at all
Maypole Little Weed;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Maypole Brewery;Half-pint, cask at Hand and Heart. Spotty lacing from a filmy layer. Clear golden-brown. Aroma of brown malts and dried fruits. Malt-fruity taste of ripe orange and mid-sweet malts. Drying ending. Okay, rather anonymous (shared with Finn, Nottingham 20.02.2016).
Pictish Cluster;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pictish Brewing;Nicely hopped with a great nose, but also very tasty too. Definitely worth a try.
Pictish Cluster;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pictish Brewing;[663-20070923] Cask @ Bag O’ Nails (Bristol, BR). Spicy citrus lemon rind aroma is a little sweet. Clear, yellow orange body with quick foamy white bubbles. Spicy passion fruit hops flavour. Light-medium body is a little bitter. Interesting but strange tang.
Pictish Cluster;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pictish Brewing;Cask-conditioned at the Bag O’Nails, Bristol 25/9/07. Pale gold with a slight white head. Inticing hoppy aroma of grapefruit and resin. Flavour had more hops with a very long lasting bitter finish. The barrel was drunk within 24 hours, which sums it up: Excellent!
Pictish Cluster;Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Pictish Brewing;Cask Stillage at the Wellington, Birmingham 20/04/2007 Small white head. Very hoppy aroma. Clear golden coloured hoppy and fruity orange flavour with some dryness in a crisp and slightly creamy bitter lasting finish.
Bank Top St Georges Ale;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bank Top Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Wellington, Birmingham 20/04/2007 Strong malt aroma. Golden coloured and slightly fruity with some alcohol present. Crisp and a little rich on the palate. Full malt finish.
Otaru Winery Pilsener;Otaru, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Otaru Winery Beer;My Bottom Line: This cleanly-brewed Pilsener provides crisp hay and subtle grassy, citrusy hoppiness to ultimately appease a growing thirst. Further Personal Perceptions: -The creamy foam quickly recedes intp the clear pale golden. -Nose is really timid, with barely a citrusy character on top of the light cereals. -Carbonation is comfortable, mouthfeel quite average. -This was served very cold, but it is evidently brewed for the masses. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Alehouse Mick's Marauders;St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Verulam Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Wellington, Birmingham 20/04/2007 Some carbonation. Citrus hop aroma. Clear golden coloured hoppy and citrus with a slightly dry lasting malt finish.
Taisetsu Keller Piruka;Asahikawa, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Bottle from Asahikawa Station as Kela Piruka. Pours a dull amber, disappearing beige head. Such a light aroma of caramel and dirt malt. Plain amber flavour, tinges of caramel and raspberry jubes before an aqueous back half. Slightly more hopping than the Pilsner. Cardboard creeping in at times, but holds its flavour throughout. Don't feel like more than one though.
Taisetsu Keller Piruka;Asahikawa, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Bottle shared, thanks Neil. Light caramel notes and very little else, quite watery with a fairly empty finish. Very mild stuff, not offensive but boring and totally forgettable, just another dark tick.
Taisetsu Keller Piruka;Asahikawa, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Bottle. Caramel, not much of interest, sweetness. However, nothing nasty in there, I guess. Just a bit lacking in character. 100% omiyage beer/dark tick.
Taisetsu Keller Piruka;Asahikawa, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Bottle shared at Tokyo Ratebeer Dark Tickers of The World Unite Event. Thanks Neil! Almost no nose, a faint whiff of caramel malt. Thin and watery malt water on the palate. Water-like finish. Pretty OK for malt-water. No flavor really.
Taisetsu Keller Piruka;Asahikawa, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Bottle from Kyoto Isetan. Best before Sept 8th 2014, Bought for the brewery tick, served in a pint glass the beer is a nice copper/amber color with almost no head - that thin fizz vanished in the blink of an eye. A bit of grainy biscuit and caramel in the aroma. Thin to medium bodied with a fairly sharp finish - the overall impression is watery.. The taste is grainy caramel malts, a bit of breadiness and a slight tangy bitter finish that has some slight metallic notes on occasion. Average but better than I expected from the other reviews on here. As it warms up it begins to go downhill a bit so drink it fast...
Taisetsu Keller Piruka;Asahikawa, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Draught at the Great Japan Beer Festival in Osaka (7/13/2013). Mostly yeast with a bit of caramel in he nose. Minimal flavors. Very light hopping. Watery. Not much going on here. Wouldn’t have another one.
Taisetsu Keller Piruka;Asahikawa, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Bottle. Rather pale amber color with a bit of lace. Earthy, caramel aroma, slightly fruity-dark. Somewhat mineral. Bubbly, sweet, caramel and fruit flavor. Bubblegum, slightly earthy, with rather light hopping. Also flavors of mineral water. Ok but watery.
Taisetsu Keller Piruka;Asahikawa, Japan;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;"My Bottom Line: This ordinary Amber Ale again caters to the masses with its frail caramel maltiness, frail doughy yeast, and shadowy wooden ending. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the hazy amber. -The flavor profile is very mild; there is not much to say about it really. -Carbonation is smooth, fitting the maltiness. -It’s clean and drinkable, but doesn’t do much more than refresh you. On tap at the brewery restaurant."
Taisetsu Pilsener;Asahikawa, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Bottle from Asahikawa Station. Pours a bronze gold, flat-looking, like lemon tea. Grassy malt biscuit aroma, a hint of tea, grain. Similar flavour, watery biscuit, sweetish malt, light citrus hopping. Kinda flat, easy to down, light body. Pretty dull.
Taisetsu Pilsener;Asahikawa, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Bottle from the Isetan Hokkaido Festival. Fruity, biscuity aroma, with golden malts and a touch of butter and honey. Slightly chewy. Deep golden color with a low, thick, bubbly head. Medium malt flavor, a touch of sweetness, some cereals, and a nicely bitter finish. Relatively crisp hopping. The hops save the day. An ok pils, not so special but decent. Too expensive, though.
Taisetsu Pilsener;Asahikawa, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;(Bottle) Pours pale golden. The aroma is of sweet grass and vegetables with hints of rice in the background. Also some notes of hay, bread and honey. The flavour is sweet malty and rice like with a light grassy, light dry and hoppy bitterness. Light to medium bodied. Quite drinkable for the style.
Taisetsu Pilsener;Asahikawa, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;My Bottom Line: Thin milky grain leads to a dry, crisp finish where mild wooden hops fail to seduce in this clean but inherently boring Pilsener for the masses. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam surrounds the clear pale gold. -Some citrus fruit adds a little character. -Carbonation is smooth, but the body is too anemic to engender a decent mouthfeel. -The flavor profile is way too mild to really be enjoyable. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Coastal Monumentale 2;Crewe, Cheshire, England;Strong Ale - English;Coastal Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Wellington, Birmingham 20/04/2007 Fruity rich and sour aroma. Dark mid brown coloured strong in alcohol and fruity with a crisp and slightly dry full malt finish.
Kamifurano Hungarian Extra Light;Kamifurano, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kamifurano Beer;My Bottom Line: Bare cereal sweetness and wheaty citrus character are about all that are produced for the taster. There isn’t much to say about this quencher, but at least it’s their easiest full glass to down. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of circles the very pale blond. -There are barely any hops in here. -The body is surprisingly not anemic, so that’s enjoyable. -Smooth prickliness helps the mouthfeel. -This is somewhat of a cross between a Kristallweizen and a basic blond lager... On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Kamifurano Light;Kamifurano, Japan;Weissbier - Kristallweizen;Kamifurano Beer;My Bottom Line: Feeble citrus fruitiness and meshed-in cereals produce an unequivocally boring, yet clean, watery Weizen. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the clear, very pale blond. -The body is very lean and obviously made for quenching. -Wheat is somewhat damp, not in its finest form at all. -I’d say this is a slightly stronger version of their Extra Light, but then again it’s almost as silent flavor-wise, so it’s hard to tell. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Kamifurano Blond;Kamifurano, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kamifurano Beer;Can. Drank one day after the brewery closed! Deep golden color with cooper tints. Cloudy. A low head with large bubbles. Very sweet and fruity aroma with honey, very fragrant, a bit too sweet of a nose but enticing. Flowery, something like melon, probably from the yeast. Very sweet, honey-like flavor. Some caramel, fruity, candied fruit. Interesting but rather too sweet. A bit of hops there to balance, but not enough. A touch of sour as well. Very light body and carbonation. A rather strange beer overall. Not bad, but not very good either. It is a bit cloying, and one would certainly be more than enough in a sitting.
Kamifurano Blond;Kamifurano, Japan;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Kamifurano Beer;My Bottom Line: A direct caramel hit wanders into wet French toast territory, as distraught herbal hops retire to their faraway asylum. This is way too sweet for quenching purposes, and dreadfully linear for tasting ventures. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circumspects the hazy deep amber(?). -The slippery mouthfeel isn’t helped by the lazy carbonation. -This is not balanced at all, and mostly incohesive. -This is clean, simple, amateurish homebrew. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Kamifurano Dark;Kamifurano, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Kamifurano Beer;My Bottom Line: Still honey puddles and earth-covered yesterday’s roast scent this lazy, muddled concoction. Forgotten vinous tartness tiptoes on by, lost and confused. Further Personal Perceptions: -Quickly headless, the cloudy deep copper isn’t very alluring. -Carbonation is again quite low, exposing the complacent maltiness. -This is their most flavorful brew, but it’s just not good. -Oh, they are no infections here, but it’s still an amateurish attempt at a craft beer. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);On pump in The Neuadd Arms. Pours black with light tan head, impressive head retention. Aromas of smoke, liquorice, burnt chocolate and blackberries. Medium bodied but very drinkable. Rich from beginning to end but without the sour aftertaste that accompanies some stout.
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);"Cask at the Harp - London. Pours brown with a staunch, lasting beige cream head. Ashy roast in the nose with nips of cocoa. Light sweet flavour with more ash, dry cocoa, burnt earth, tobacco, charred beef. Light bodied with fine carbonation; good condition. Moderate sweet to finish, with more sturdy roasted malts, chalky cocoa, torched wood and dried dark berries. Not bad."
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);Cask (gravity) @ The 17th Reading Beer and Cider Festival 2011, Reading, Berkshire England. Clear dark black brown colour with a average, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, light beige head. Aroma is moderate to heavy malty, roasted, burnt, dark roasted. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter with a long duration, dark roasted, sweet licorice. Body is medium, texture is oily, carbonation is soft to flat. [20110430]
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);Cask@Great Welsh Beer & Cider Festival 2011. Black colour, mediumsized brown head. Aroma is roasted malts, liquorice and some caramel, toffee and mild dark berries. Flavour is roasted malts, caramel, some liquorice and mild grassy notes. Mild coffee and smoked wet wooden notes as welll.
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);Bottle from Björn, thanks. Thick fluffy brown head. Dark-red color. Fine roasted malty aroma with some dark chrystal notwes. The taste is much harder roasted boardering to harsh together with black coffey taste.
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);Nice gentle aroma, good healthy mild stout flavour, although only medium bodied.
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);Bottled. Black, rich head. Roast yand creamy. Dry and mild with some licorice and soft mouthfeel. Hugely drinkable with marked, yet mild roastiness and balanced bitterness.
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);"Gravity, Coventry 2011. Type of beer that makes me think there might be some kind of covert scene going on somewhere in Wales. Mahogany with a yellowed tan head going nowhere. Aroma lightly smoked peat and grilled aubergine. Condition is thick and moussey; taste is slightly dank aubergine, ink (only have the occasional half) and peat dusted with drinking chocolate. Beautiful. Might just give that English muck a miss in future."
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);cask at NWAF ... deep black.. soft roast malt nose ... soft juicy roast malts ... light charcal ... little soapy pine hop ... light but there ... hint of coffee
Heart of Wales Welsh Black;Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, Wales;Stout;Heart of Wales (Neuadd Arms);Gravity at the 2009 Great Welsh Beer Festival, pours a dark red-brown with a coarse beige head. The nose has apples, toffee and lots of black treacle. Quite light bodied, with a dry, slightly vinous taste and a long dry bitter finish that doesn’t match up to the promise of the aroma - a bit one-dimensional.
Piltri Roja;El Bolson, Argentina;Pale Ale - English;Piltri;A decent light hops taste gives this beer complexity and a medium body. Soft carbonation, though not a lot of aftertaste. A decent lighter beer. ON tap at the El Bolson craft fair.
Piltri Roja;El Bolson, Argentina;Pale Ale - English;Piltri;Appearance: amber reddish color. Not foam. Aroma: caramel malts, soft toasty and dark sugar. Fruitiness of peaches, quinces, berries and nuts. Slight liquory. Floral hoppyness. Flavor: unfortunately slightly excessive acidity. However, high and nice, intensively of caramels malts. Sweet-fruitiness of peaches, pears, quince and blond-raisins. Citric-fruitiness of mango and green apples. Liquory, , reminiscences of whisky and gold rum. Finish with slight, but persistent, floral-herby-hoppyness. Palate: medium body, watery texture. Medium carbonation. Discrete, with nice hoppy and candy. (sorry for my english)
Harghita;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;Süffiger, muffig hellmalziger Beginn. Wenig bitter, etwas brotig, geringe Würzigkeit. Meh. 8/6/7/6/6/6

Harghita;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;Bottled. Average lager look and characteristics, proveditself surprisingly drinkable, decent bittersweet taste with sweetish finish. If it wasnt for the unpleasant aroma, it could even be better.
Harghita;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;0,5l bottle. Clear yellow colour with medium lasting foamy white head. Aroma: Grains, corn, slight caramel notes. Taste: Light sweet malty start with a light bitter mouthfeel. Unfrotunately it’s too watery, otherwise it won’t be bad. Light body with medium carbonation. Short light sourish/bitter/dry finish.
Harghita;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;Bottle (at manufactura, Timisoara). Pours clear golden. Aroma is caramel, cardboard, grains, some butter. Flavor is sweet, grains, caramel, some butter. Overall: rather bad.
Harghita;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;Bottle. Pours pale amber to yellowish, small white head. The aroma is a bit grassy, a few notes of honey and toasted malt but in general very light and unsurprising (which is not necessarily bad). The taste is a bit more of a letdown, with a light but brusque paper-like character to it, some malt and grassy flavours too. The palate is a further problem, since the mild body is made more unpalatable by its downright watery feel, any complexity hindered by low carbonation and an -uncharming- finish. Other Romanian lagers are significantly better.
Harghita;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;Poured from the bottle purchased in Bucharest into a short glass to drink. The beer had a light clear golden color with a foamy head that had fairly good retention, lacing, and cling. The aroma had a mixture of corn, straw, and barley tones, and was not well defined. The taste had a slightly bitter hops character with a bit of straw and corn. It was a dry beer and fairly thin and water with low carbonation and character.
Harghita;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;Its made by hungarians in Romania. Very very good, but has had a disadvantage : Its very watery. The colors of the beer is perfect, but too watery.
Harghita;Miercurea Ciuc, Romania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Heineken Romania;Picked up in a supermarket in Cluj. Pours a clear golden color, pale, topped with average white head. Grainy nose, sweet body with some bitterness in the finish. Nothing special, typical mass lager. Still drinkable if nothing else.
Furano Ki Pilsner;Furano, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yama no Dokuson/Furano Ji-Beer;Wow. 11 year gap for these guys! Tap at Keyaki. Cleaning fluid in the nose, some citrus. Shiny golden color. Malty and sweet with some lemon. Pretty lame but we were able to finish the small cup.
Furano Ki Pilsner;Furano, Japan;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Yama no Dokuson/Furano Ji-Beer;My Bottom Line: This easily-downed Pilsener serves its main purpose efficiently, but its feeble herbal, spicy hops and watery passages don’t do much more than quench. A crisper maltiness would’ve taken it much further. Further Personal Perceptions: -The foam sticks to the really light golden. -Herbal hops subtly linger. -Prickly carbonation is fine for drinkability. -There is balance in its frailty. -Milky passages add some complexity. -This is very cleanly brewed, just not that flavorful. -Served quite cold, it was at least a decent quaffer. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Furano Yami Dark;Furano, Japan;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Yama no Dokuson/Furano Ji-Beer;My Bottom Line: Raisins sweeten the roast of this sustaining and drinkable Dunkel, only to see themselves balanced out by careful herbal hops. This would be a nice introductory beer for those with dark beer phobia. Further Personal Perceptions: -A creamy head of foam garnishes the darkest burgundy. -Flavors are shy like those of their Pilsener, but it is not as watery. -The maltiness could’ve been more expressive, but all works in this well-integrated partnership of flavors. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Northern Falling Stone;Northwich, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blakemere Brewery;Cask Stillage at the Ship & Mitre, Liverpool 27/04/2007 Golden bronze coloured. Slightly fruity and sour. Some bitterness in a dry malt finish.
Fenland The Hop Who Loved Me;Ely, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fenland Brewery;Cask handpump at Cambridge BF 2007. Golden with a big frothy head. Lovely sweet, perfumed, slightly honey scent. Very very bitter and hoppy with quite a dry finish but not much else going on. Good but a touch boring.
Hakodate Kölsch;Hakodate, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Hakodate Beer;Light hoppy nose, not grassy at all, rather green and fresh. Light bitter, watery taste with a finish of canned corn. Nice aroma but the taste isn't that great.
Hakodate Kölsch;Hakodate, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Hakodate Beer;A bit sweet for me but clear, clean and tasty. Decent and drinkable. Pours clear with lacy head. Hint of toffee on the nose. Sessionable.
Hakodate Kölsch;Hakodate, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Hakodate Beer;Backlog, on tap during my visit to the brewery/restaurant in 2008. Golden color, slightly hazy. Aroma’s: light fruity, light sweet, some malt/grain. Flavor is mostly neutral, some fruit. Light bodied. Finishes ever so slightly bitter. Clean tasting and well crafted, but rather bland.
Hakodate Kölsch;Hakodate, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Hakodate Beer;On tap at the brewpub. Hazy golden with a small head. Fruity aroma and flavours, hints of apples. Bitter balance. Boring.
Hakodate Kölsch;Hakodate, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Hakodate Beer;On tap at the brewery, 2007. Unfiltered, cloudy. Thick-looking yellow, darker than the weizen but a pasty, cloudy, yellow with a bit of orange. A good, foamy head. Rich aroma of malt, yeast, hops. Flavor: buttery, creamy, fruity. Great hops—maybe it’s not really a koelsch! Actually, it is, but very well-hopped and flavorful. Good fruitiness and good malt A burning hop finish—unlike any koelsch in Koeln. Great, the hops make it. The buttery flavor is also distinctive, and it is heavier than usual for the type.
Hakodate Kölsch;Hakodate, Japan;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Hakodate Beer;My Bottom Line: Herbal hops pleasure from nose to aftertaste, as crisp hay adds a little crunch to this otherwise svelte quaffer. This is yet another Japanese unfiltered Kölsch that works while never wowing. Further Personal Perceptions: -A nice head of foam sits atop the hazy straw golden. -Citrusy fruitiness adds complexity and drinkability. -Carbonation is comfortable and maltiness lean, which makes for a decent mouthfeel. -The hoppy bitterness is quite enticing. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
De Lourdes;San Martín Texmelucan, Puebla, Mexico;Apple Cider;Sidra De Lourdes;VEry bad if you ask me, it has only the touch of apple peel as an aftertaste but it was pretty much chemical.
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Lata. Clear like amber colour with a medium off-white head. Well toasted caramel malty flavour with fruity hoppy notes. Good palate. Flavour had a good well toasted maltiness with caramel and fruit hops, little smoke like note.
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Can. Light malty nose,some grain and grass and light yeast. Flavors of bread, gentle roast malt, caramel, light bittering hops, and more yeast. Thin body. Definitely in the neighborhood of an altbier, but not the best one on the block.
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Pours a bit hazy, brown and with a thin white film. Light caramel and some grass in the aroma. Flavour is slightly sour, malty background is strong but I am somewhat disturbed with that sourness. Not the greatest balance with hops, feels messy, . Finish is dry and malty, not bad but could probably have a bit more depth.
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;"""Amber 5%"". Slight haze, light amber. Medium head. Aroma has a slightly harsh crackery note. Similar palate, bit thin and husky, finishes crackery."
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Can from Kyoto Isetan. 5% It pours a clear brown with a thin beige head that vanished fast. The nose is grainy, nutty, a bit buttery and somewhat cake like. Med-thin with a scratchy carbonation. The flavor is nutty, a bit metallic, a touch buttery, bitter and grainy. Like the Amao, not terrible per se but not all that good either. Then again I don’t care for the alt style so much.
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Who nicked the hops? Malty red ale with low hopping. Welcome to the world of Japanese Alts. Straight forward, bready, caramel and very soft finish. Stuck in first gear unfortunately.
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Can. Cloudy ruddy brown with a big offwhite head. Sharp fruity aroma. Fruity flavours and some hoppy maltiness. Refreshingly fruity alt (aruto).
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Can bought next to the brewery. nov. 2007. Nice amber/copper color, average or darker for the style. Looks appealing, with a low head. Cloudy. Aroma its on the weak side. Amber malts, lightly roasted, with a touch of fruit and nuts. Appealing, but faint. Caramel malt flavor, with a touch of coffee. Decent roasting. Dry. Not terribly complex, but a decent alt taste. Slightly nutty, not too sweet, a bit of sour. Roasted amber malt finish with a bit of fruit, sweet and sour, some slightly lingering hops. Not terribly interesting, but a reliable alt. It is very faithful to style.
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Dirty brown color with oranges and grapefruit in the nose. Smooth mouth that show signs of tobacco leaves, earthiness, but underlying hops. Well balanced bitter finish. Nice.
Onuma Alt;Onuma, Japan;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Brauhaus Onuma;Can @ Hakodate Station: Nose of light husk and grain, medium gold, light amber color. Flavor is hoppy, nice light malt flavors and a clean hop balance. Smooth and light grassy notes in the tail. Decent.

Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;Bottle from souvenir shop in Hakodate. Nose of dark fruit, sugar, alcohol, overripe dates -- sort of vegetal, like two-day old garbage lees. Dark amber/brown color. Flavors are thick and quite boozy all the way through, with berries, caramel, and a lightly malty flat finish. Medium body and hot on the tongue. Kind of a mess, really. Very thin for the high alcohol heat it packs. Has a certain initial appeal but loses it rather quickly.
Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;Bottle from the brewery. Pours thick brown, no head. Smells of chestnut, dates, pineau. Nice thick mouthfeel. A good example and we’ll balance. Nice after dinner stuff.
Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;Tap at Yellow Ape, Osaka. Hazy orange with a slight head. Big gummy, candy-ish aroma with fruity banana and orange peel notes. Taste is similar but a bit toned down. Actually reminds me of a weizen bock more than a barley wine. Really unusual but very good.
Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;Botella de 33 cl, adquirida en tienda de Mt Hakodate Ropeway, en Hakodate, Japon. Color marron. Sabor a malta, caramelo, alcohol, dulce.
Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;On tap and part of my 1000 yen tasting set. It is a malty sweet beer with a wine like taste. I definitely got impressions of red wine. The color was a mellow gold with just a hint of the 10% punch it packed. My favorite out of the three I enjoyed in my tasting set.
Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;On tap at the brewpub. Dark colour and creamy head visible in the keg. Nice raisiny fruit aroma. sweet raisins flavours that has still got appropriate bitterness to balance it somewhat. The name means: the everyday beer of the CEO. I can understand him~this is by far the best of the Hakodate beer range.
Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;Draught at Yellow Ape. A very different beer to the previous. Light amber now, with no hops at all. Very estery, peaches, slight banana. Like a Belgian yeast gone bad. Much worse than it use to be. Draught at the brewery, Oct 2007. 7/3/7/4/15 Ceramic cup. Darkish brown with almost no head. A bit of lace. Aroma of dark fruits and malt, raisins, alcohol. Good nose! Tastes strongly of alcohol, portish. Fruity, hot, sweet, but balanced. Strong carbonation for the type. Berries and alcohol are strongest. Nice enough. Nothing bad to say, though a bit simple. Very winey or aperitif-like. Smooth for its strength, and very drinkable. Nice strong stuff with good hops.
Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;I struggled with this one. It just was a big, sweet malty mess, though the alcohol was really well hidden. No balance or real direction in the beer. I hope the President doesn’t drink this too often it might kill his palate.
Hakodate Shacho No Yoku Nomu Biiru;Hakodate, Japan;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Hakodate Beer;"My Bottom Line: French toast whiffs and diluted caramel whip up a portly body where alcohol generously flows. This Barley Wine with Malt Liquor leanings remains classy enough to warrant serious sipping, but its lack of depth and worrisome future are soon revealed. This cannot be an allegory for any presidency, right? Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam sits atop the glowing hazy amber. -The finish is severely underhopped, even though this bottle is very young for the style. -Carbonation is quite smooth, which serves the round maltiness quite well. -It’s cleanly brewed and well rounded, but it ultimately disappoints as the brewery’s ""luxury"" product. -I believe the malt liquor component will develop even more as it ages; in any case, it doesn’t have enough substance to age into anything pleasant. -A lot of brewer’s sugar seems to be used...or some other added sugar. Bottled on July 7th, 2007."

Red Star Summer Lager: Colossus in Disguise;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Red Star Agave Grille;Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color. Aroma is lagerlike but perhaps with mild & sweet sour hints. Taste is similar to many pale yellow lager and hides the alky content rather well. Barely any bitterness but there is some industrial kick to this. Some mild carbonation. OK and quite friendly, you’d never know this is near 8% so be careful if you have a few. Comes on and finishes like any other pale lager!
Red Star Summer Lager: Colossus in Disguise;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Pilsener - Imperial;Red Star Agave Grille;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a very pale straw yellow color with a medium sized white head that faded quickly. The aroma was sour, tangy macro lager with a light hint of sulfur. The flavor was tangy, lightly sweet and had a fairly typical macro lager profile. There was a hint of sulfur underneath. There was a light alcohol burn. The body was a bit thicker than I expected.

Romantic Village All Malt Black Beer;Utsunomiya, Japan;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Romantic Village Beer / Utsunomiya Craft Beer;Bottle (rated in Apr 2008). Head is mostly lasting. Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, husks). Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter, husky. Light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Romantic Village All Malt Black Beer;Utsunomiya, Japan;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Romantic Village Beer / Utsunomiya Craft Beer;"My Bottom Line: This farce of a Schwarzbier thinks that flaky, lasting roastiness is all it takes to make a competent example. Indeed, its fragile thinness quickly turns this helpless roastiness into a severely ashy, burnt finish, making the end result very difficult to swallow. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam shrouds the brown-sleeved blackness. -Effervescence is smooth. -This tastes like a really cheap, watery lager to which way too much black patent malt has been added. -Some brown rum is found, upon closer inspection (why am I even looking for something here?) -Ironically, their slogan is ""we did our best to brew the best beer for you"". Bottle."
Romantic Village All Malt Beer (Mugijiro);Utsunomiya, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Romantic Village Beer / Utsunomiya Craft Beer;basically I had this side by side with the mugitaro at the brewery and felt as a guy who has probably tried 7000+ different beers, I could barley tell the difference with the mugitaro. If it’s lost on me then how do other people tell the difference? Or does the brewery really care? (mouth feel was slightly weaker)
Romantic Village All Malt Beer (Mugijiro);Utsunomiya, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Romantic Village Beer / Utsunomiya Craft Beer;Tap at the Romantic Village. Blond coloured.

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately bitter, husky, unclean. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.
Romantic Village All Malt Beer (Mugijiro);Utsunomiya, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Romantic Village Beer / Utsunomiya Craft Beer;"My Bottom Line: Clean pils malts build a sturdy body fit for sessioning, but apart from the honeyed cereal flavors, there isn’t much to please the tastebuds here. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam covers the transparent golden. -The nose is too shy to be enticing. -The base malts return in the finish. -Herbal, wooden hoppiness is very subtle; more would’ve helped. -Mouthfeel is decent, but there aren’t many flavors to speak of. -Carbonation isn’t overdone. -This is actually drinkable and refreshing, which wasn’t the case for the Black Lager. Bottle; best before Aug.18th (had on July 14th)."
Harviestoun Ruby Murray;Alva, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Harviestoun Brewery;Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in July 2007. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear dark copper red in colour with a thin buff head. Slight hint of ribena fruit in the short aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a digestive biscuit note laced with syrupy dates. Spicy hop resins gives a short bitter aftertaste. Finish is sweet with blackcurrants present in the mouth. A decent session ale. Pity Harviestoun cannot expand on this beer style.

Capitol City Cream Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;Capitol City Brewing Company;Draft at Shirlington location. Not sure how long it had been since it was poured, as head was small once it arrived at my table. Appearance is a moderately cloudy, yellow body. Aroma is, well a bit creamy, sweet malt aroma. Flavor has some doughy elements, with a touch of sweet malts and hops.
Capitol City Cream Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Cream Ale;Capitol City Brewing Company;"Pint at the downtown location. About 10% opaque, yellow body with a half-inch thick soda pop bubble head. At first glance it looks not different than the kolsch which is beside me, but if you stare long enough you may notice the faintest bit of cloudiness. Nose is rather unexciting and plain, I don’t pick up really any cream aromas, rather it’s a mix of some sweet cracked cereal grains, a faint hint of corn, and some very faint doughy and grassy hops. Flavorwise it’s pallid, strikes the tongue with heavy carbonation and a light, empty body, with a small, barely noticeable amount of ""cream"" flavor, in addition to the sweet corn and grain flavor. Very pallid, very plain."
Sierra Dorada;Rochester, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Genesee Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);A sweet and quenching brew that clearly was developed by someone with some skill or perhaps luck. still, thin in taste. some corn and beery carbonation with a touch of malt and hop. a bit creamy with foam a clean burp it has a tang and a chalk that does provide some depth. $2.00 FOR A SIX PACK i found it interesting that a brew of this quality could be made and sold in the capitalist jewel of North America while still angling towards the purpose giving p-r-o-f-i-t. Of course we can usually rely on the good people of upstate NY to produce something without money being the prime objective... BRAVO!

Big aroma of carmelized pears, apples, brown sugar, and bourbon. Some oxidation on the nose, which always scares me. The pour is a clear honey gold with a nice soapy head. Great retention. Assertive bourbon presence in the mouth, especially at the beginning and in the long burn on the back end. Not cloyingly sweet like I feared, but powerful and bold. There is a very pleasant stone fruit tone in there, but it’s wiped out a it by the bourbon. This is a sipper. Nicely done, though a little heavy and hot from the bourbon.

It’s got a beautiful color and a moderate tan head, but the taste doesn’t hold up to the expectations from the looks and smell.
High & Mighty Two-Headed Beast;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;High & Mighty Beer Co;Bottle in NYC. Pours black with a huge, beige cream head. There’s some cocoa in here, sure, as well as modest roast, but unfortunately the beer is a bit sour. Nicer (but not necessarily pleasant) chocolate notes in the finish. Some ash and tobacco. Light bodied with explosive carbonation. Too bad.
High & Mighty Two-Headed Beast;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;High & Mighty Beer Co;Botlle. Moderate toasted and cocoa powder for the malt, light herbs and basement for the hops and yeast, with notes of solvent, vinegar and prune. Head is small, frothy/fizzy, light brown with no lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is very dark brown, Flavor starts heavily acidic and sour. then finishes moderately acidic, lightly bitter and acetic. Palate is light ot medium, watery with a lively carbonation and a dry finish. Sour, simple and artificially dry, there’s not much else to this Foreign Stout.
High & Mighty Two-Headed Beast;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;High & Mighty Beer Co;Bottle from Table & Vine. Not what I was expecting. Has that dry, dusty cocoa nib taste, as advertised, but completely lacking in body. Watery with some sharp metallic notes, green pepper, weird tartness. Toasted grain and some sweet dark malts, light fruity note and some molasses. Unpleasant copper finish.
High & Mighty Two-Headed Beast;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;High & Mighty Beer Co;"22 oz bottle. Got at Table and Vine; West Springfield, MA. Opaque black, thick full tan head that dies slow. Lots of lacing down the snifter. Pleasant nose of cocoa, roasted barley and light ash. Taste follows the nose. Lots of roasted barley I get the most from the taste, with other mentioned in aroma. Very light body for a stout. It lacks some depth, a bit to thin, not the chewy and creamy like the commercial description indicates. However it does have a hop bitterness as the stout warms. Dry finish. A nice stout for the hot summer months. It doesn’t fill you up and is quite easy to drink. With a lower ABV you can enjoy it without getting smashed. I enjoyed this stout. Would buy again."
High & Mighty Two-Headed Beast;Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;High & Mighty Beer Co;Bottle from Total Wine. Pours raven black with a rim of tan head. Tight, tan lacing. Strong nose of coffee, cocoa, and toffee. Flavors of dark fruits, plum, coffee bean, and grape. Soft/medium carbonation and medium/full body, almost thin for a stout. Overall, a satisfying brew.

Grafton Packet Punch;Worksop, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grafton Brewing;Half, cask. Copper coloured body with a reddish tint. Some floaters on the top. Weak hoppy to the nose. Lighter taste of malts followed by a sour kind of bitterness. Watered in the mouth and rather anonymous in texture (with food, upstairs at The Market Porter, London Bridge 01.08.2009).
Grafton Packet Punch;Worksop, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grafton Brewing;Cask conditioned at Oxford Beer Fest ’07. Murky orange with no head. This was just bad, off, chemical and really poor. Basically undrinkable.
Grafton Packet Punch;Worksop, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Grafton Brewing;Dartford Beer Fest. Milk chocolate and a sort of chemical vanilla. An odd mix of pale and amber malts that doesn’t quite come off for me. Vanilla toffee. Kind of unpleasant. Some roasts mainly in the nose, but also lingering on the tongue.
Storm Windgather;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);Cask at Lazy Trout, Meerbrook. Pours golden amber with an off white head. Quite a light fruity bitter, some maltiness. Pleasant enough.
Storm Windgather;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);In The Brewers Arms, Macclesfield. Great place to watch United, crap for beer. The usual effort from Storm, totally not my thing. Lightly spiced hop aroma. Manages to be watery and grainy with a short bitter finish. Don’t like it.

Storm Windgather;Macclesfield, Cheshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Storm Brewing Co. (UK);Cask at Ye Olde Nags Head, Castleton, Derbyshire. Pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold with an average size creamy white head. Decent lacing. Mild resiny hop aroma along with some light spices. Mild hoppy flavour, lightly spicy, a touch watery and with a short bitter finish. (Thankfully not fruity, I’m tired of all these fruity Bitters I’ve been having.) Average bodied. Pretty good, I didn’t think too much of it at first but it really grew on me. It’s nice that it’s different then many of the Bitters available here.
Cable Car Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;"Only place I have seen this is at Winn-Dixie here in Florida, or at least the one I shop at. They always have it on sale ""with winn-dixie card of course"" for $9.99 a 12-pack, so like everyone else here....said ""WTH....let's try it to add a review at the least"". It is actually slightly better than I thought it would be, but wasn't expecting much to begin with. For 83 cents a beer though, I have had a lot worse....and actually not much better for the price I guess. Basically, it is what it is...a malty barely hoppy semi-watery beer. Aroma is semi-skunky, appearance is a thin watery amber color, and flavor is 'aight. Would be ok for parties or beach, but not much more."
Cable Car Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Decent amber ale, not sure why all the really low ratings, caramel, floral, grassy, decent.

Cable Car Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;I expected better, not just better, but a whole damn lot better. Tasted sweet and blah, no real aftertaste. Nuff said, I can’t recommend.
Cable Car Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;355ml bottle pours amber in color with a small white head that leaves only a few spots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild caramel and honey with hints of grass. Taste is predominantly caramel malty sweetness with a mild grassy hop bitterness. Light bodied with mild carbonation. A below average amber ale and not recommended.
Cable Car Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Kind of a gross looking beer. Dirty amber color. Taste was all sugary malts.

Cable Car Amber Ale;Novato, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;World Brews, Winery Exchange Inc.;Very disappointed. I was excited for the small batch and the fact that it was next to some good beers at Whole Foods. Did not enjoy it. No aroma and very little taste.
Keweenaw Raspberry Stout;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Keweenaw Brewing Company;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a dark brown close to black with some noticeable dark purple hues along the sides. Just a cap of a little cream colored head, just falls off into oblivion. Lace? What lace, none there. The aroma seemed to blend some cranberries to raspberries up front - the sweet to the tart. Light roast and then some coffee grounds. The flavor leaned into more of a sour to tart boldness up front of the fruits. Light smoke/semi-sweet meatiness came oddly. Sour to tart sort of fruity aftertaste rolling into the finish. The feel was about medium bodied, but just a touch under. The harshness of the sour oddly enough seemed to compliment the roast. Did I lose my mind this day or just wait way too long for one of my friends to show up but he never did? He crashed his 4 wheeler that day, but anyways, back to the beer, the harshness claimed the sour and the roast and the sweet meatiness. Overall, now that was a decent beer, not sure if it was a stout or a fruit beer, but I didn’t care, I’d have another. And Tim got a new 4 wheeler the following year - all is well with the world.
Keweenaw Raspberry Stout;Houghton, Michigan, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Keweenaw Brewing Company;On nitro-tap at the brewpub. Aroma is a weak waft of creamed raspberries and plant skins. A bit sourish, in the stout way. Pours a paler shade of dark, with a nitro cream head in oatmeal. Flavor begins with a distinct note of pan seared natural casing beef frank skin. This marries with an Indonesian raspberry candy and the loveliest mild stout background. The palate for this beer need not be covered over with raspberries and wieners. There’s a psychotically drinkable stout in the background. More perfectly quaffable than any dry stout I’ve experienced and right on par with many dark milds. Fortunately the fruit character fade and the hot dogs go to the back of the room with some chalk and I’m left practically guzzling this most refreshing of beers. Clear the way berries, stout coming through. Very nice roast malt tannins, gentle coffee touches and an edge of sherry. Finishes without hop detection and on a longing edge of cranberry pulp.
Bud Silver;London, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stag Mortlake (AB InBev UK);Soft lager beer. Refreshing. Brewed in Ukraine by the original license, I guess. A bit better than the average lager beer.
Bud Silver;London, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stag Mortlake (AB InBev UK);Can, from Tesco. Gold, thin shortlived white head and gentle condition. Low maltiness with a touch of starchy esters in the nose, soft and thin in the mouth with a touch of fruitiness and a slight estery note returning briefly in the finish.
Bud Silver;London, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stag Mortlake (AB InBev UK);Bottled(568ml). -bought somewhere in London. Clear golden coloured, small white head, malty lemony nose. The taste is very weak and watery, slight sweet malty with notes of cereals and nothing else. Notes of caramel in the finish.
Bud Silver;London, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stag Mortlake (AB InBev UK);A pint bottle shared with and courtesy of ozujsko, who brought it from London (thanks!) Oh lookie, my first Bud and it’s not the regular thing nor is it brewed in the USA. Poured a nice orange-golden colour with a very big fluffy white chem head that went away at a medium pace. The nose is sour, lemony and a touch of malt. Three sour smelling crappy pale lagers in a row. Lovely. This one turned out to be the worst of the bunch. The taste is weak, dull, watery, weak apple, weak background hop bitterness,maybe malt, plastic... As pathetic as I thought it’d be. Few redeeming features. Not particularly drinkable, even less enjoyable. The commercial description makes things even funnier. Apparently brewed for a fuller flavour and a clean finish. The finish isn’t clean and the taste could be called full only by someone certifiable. Not the worst beer I’ve ever had, but all in all, a failure.
Bud Silver;London, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stag Mortlake (AB InBev UK);Can. Golden with a small head. Aromas are soft lemon and soap with thin hops. Flavours are soapy and hoppy with some sharp lemon. Soft grain and corn with a lightly dry finish. Probably a bit better than standard Bud.
Bud Silver;London, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stag Mortlake (AB InBev UK);Can from asda. Aroma is very metallic, like horribly aluminuim fillings mixed with oil, as you sometimes get in workshops, cornish grainy malt character. Looks not to shabby but head disapears and it looks bad eventually. Taste is a similar bag of sh*iteness similar to aroma. Not one of my better brews!
Bud Silver;London, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Stag Mortlake (AB InBev UK);Can (at my friends place, this was the only beer he had in the fridge). Probably one of the worst beers i ever had. Tastes like metal and corn, very industrial, with a limp sugary, sweet, thin mouthfeel. Pretty bad.
Randys Fun Hunters Mos Babys Got Bock Maibock;Whitewater, Wisconsin, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Randys Restaurant & Fun Hunters Brewery;On tap at the Randy’s Fun Hunters Brew Pub. Poured a medium golden color with a small sized white head. Aromas of toffee, caramel, citrus, alcohol, lightly nutty and lightly floral. Tastes of toffee, nutty, and citrus. Medium alcohol finish. Light lacing left on the glass.
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;Ok. I’ve noticed different reviewers have stated different ABV’s for this beer so it must vary between batches. My bottle (bottled 5 weeks ago) has an ABV of 5.5%! 330ml bottle into pint glass. Aroma of smoky malt and dark chocolate, not what I was expecting. Hazy golden bronze beer with rapidly dissipating white head. Highly carbonated. Full body, sticky texture. Caramel malt in the finish then a little hoppy fruitiness right at the end. Funny old beer. Calls itself ’Pale’, is classified as a Golden Ale but reminds me of a strong English Bitter. Must be easy to drink because it’s all gone!
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;Not sure this batch was entirely right, lots of meaty yeast flavours and not much else going on, lacking in flavour in general. Really off aftertaste.
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;650ml bottle (bottled on 18/4/13) at Yulli’s restaurant, Sydney which has a fine beer list to go with the vegetarian food. The ABV is now 4.8% for this batch release. Appears clear amber-brown with a decent off white head. Nose has flowery perfumy hops (English-style) on top of a caramel malt bill. Palate is deliciously smooth and silky with lovely balanced flavours and a firm floral hop bitterness. It is medium bodied with perfect carbonation for the style which is really an English-style pale ale rather than a golden/blond ale as per description above. Excellent stuff - I was reminded of Seven Sheds’ Kentish Ale which is another fine Aussie version of this style. The larger bottle size is appropriate for this very sessionable ale.
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;Pours a hazy dark amber with a off white fast disappearing head. Quite pleasant slightly floral aroma that doesn’t come through strongly on tasting. Not a strong tasting beer, a bit of toast, a hint of fruit (possibly passionfruit) upfront, very lttle aftertaste with little bitterness. Has an early fizziness that quickly disappears. OK.
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;330ml bottle. Pours a muddy brown, with almost no head and no lace. A sweet, treacle-like aroma is noticeable, with some floral hops lurking in the background. Slightly oily pine hops to start, with sweet malt coming in next. Mouth-coating caramel dominates the middle, moving into a floral hop finish. It’s not a looker, but it is a decent, if slightly simple, ale.
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;330ml bottle. Pours with a lively crackle as the deep head of big bubbles forms and settles quickly. Passionfruit dominates the aroma and is very pleasing. Hazy sunset colour and quite lively in the mouth with a mild bitterness and a bit of fizz.
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;average beer, low carbonation. quite florally on the nose, with a heavy bitterness on the finish
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;Bottle - dated 29.5.09 4.2% Pours a very hazy orange, head disappeared straight away. Almost cidery aroma. As said below hard to get an idea of the flavour as the carbonation really cuts in - dry citrus , not much of an aftertaste. Agree with the homebrew reference
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;Bottle. Clear amber (but avoided pouring the sediment in the bottle) with a short-lived very loose white head. The aroma was fairly pleasant: not very pronounced but mostly floral. The palate is wrong, it has a light body but weird carbonation. It froths up in the mouth making it hard to taste and not quenching. It wasn’t obviously over-carbonated in that it did not froth out of the bottle on opening, but the mouthfeel of the carbonation didn’t work. The flavour was disappointing. There is very little foretaste and what there is is rather sharp - somewhat acidic, but not say in a pleasant citrusy way. It shifts gear abruptly to a rather metallic bitter finish, although there are some pleasant floral notes that develop when the initial harsh bitterness subsides. Disappointing.
Happy Goblin Pale Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Happy Goblin Brewery;This version bottled 11June 2008 is 4.5%abv. Eastery banana aroma. hazy orange color with small white head. May have been infected.
Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;330ml bottle from Oak Barrel, Sydney with bottling date of 25/3/13 and ABV of 6.8%. A cloudy amber-brown beer with a large yellowy-tinged white head that provides a decent lace. Nose is richly malty with butterscotch, marmalade and light floral hops. Taste is sweet and treacly with fullish body and sticky palate. Finishes with a mild floral hop bitterness and alcoholic warmth. I was reminded of Theakston’s Olde Peculiar from UK.
Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;330ml bottle at 6.2% ABV. Pours an opaque copper amber, with a tiny, fading white head. The nose has a strong whiff of alcohol, with some caramel too. Mild, fruity hops to start, with a sweet, treacley malt soon coming in to join them. It is all a bit simplistic, and too watery. Not very good.
Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;Bottle 330ml. Great malt-driven beer. Aromas of caramel, vanilla, oak, and hints of banana.

Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;Cooper in colour. No head. Really sweet, heaps of caramal. Thin and sticky in the mouth. Not very enjoyable.
Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;330ml bottle. Looks a bit flat when poured, copper in colur with a thin line of white foam around the edge of the glass. Spiced fruit aroma with port soaked peaches coming through. Strong flavour with mild bitterness and also an underlying sweetness that comes through and lingers.
Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;An oversweet, under-attenuated strong ale. I really enjoyed the brewer’s Dark Ale but the stout and this strong ale need some work IMO. This one was amber in colour with a 1cm head that fizzled down to nothing far too quickly. The aroma was soft and anonymous - a bit metallic with faint stewed fruits but little to excite the senses. The mouthfeel was oily and under-carbonated, like the stout. There’s some raisiny fruit and liquid toffees before a late alcoholic warmth but it’s too sweet and ultimately a bit bland. One for the sweet-toothed only. (330ml bottle from Leura Cellars. 7% abv. Bottled 19/6/09)
Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;Bottle - 8.4.09 6.6%. Poured a hazy dark orange. very small head disappeared before I could get the glass to my mouth. Flavour is hard to describe, it hits the back of the tounge first - caramel malt but something vegetable not that nice. Mellows out to a nutty aftertaste. If not for the veg taste I could really like this beer.
Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;Bottle (330ml). Poured copper with a slight haze and a small, frothy, lightly tanned head which was average lasting. An aroma of rich toffee malts with sticky caramel pudding, sultana’s, chocolate, pinch of allspice and an odd stewed vegetable note in the back (carrots). Flavor was of rich toffee malts with a very light bitterness, raisins, caramelized dates, light notes of fruitcake and a slightly nutty finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation, a creamy mouthfeel, somewhat syrupy texture and a decent length finish.
Happy Goblin Strong Ale;Mount Kuring-Gai, NSW, Australia;Strong Ale - English;Happy Goblin Brewery;330ml bottle, 6.5%abv, bottled 15.10.07, served chilled. The label is the same as the regular Happy Goblin, but has STRONG written in marker on the label. Managed to grab the 5 remaining bottles of this from the local grog shop. Pours a slightly hazy looking pale amber body with a collar of off-white foam. Grain malt aroma, has nutty caramel note to it, odd smokiness, some subtle earthy British hop character. Body is far fuller than that of its little brother, quite rich and sticky, carbonation is moderately low. Big mouthful of caramel maltiness from the word go, quite sweet with additional nutty malt and woodiness, some floral hops appear towards a drying finish, bring with it a hint of bitterness. Seems to even out moreso as it warms. Certainly an interesting offering from my ’local’ brewery, and I daresay nicer than the Pale Ale.
Bluegrass Weizenbock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;on tap at BBC. hazy orange amber with a disappearing white head. banana clove aroma. sweet banana flavor with a bit of clove light caramel and vanilla. flavor a bit too sweet. the finish is a bad mix of bitter caramel and banana...the finish is just a bit of a mess. medium to full body. just not that great.
Bluegrass Weizenbock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;On tap at BBC 8/07. Deep brown, costly clear, short off-white head. Aroma was nutty, bit of herbal clove. Medium body, toffee, banana, citrus. Nice brew, not too heavy, easy to drink.
Bluegrass Weizenbock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Surprised to see this on draft at The Pub in Lexington,Kentucky. The bartender mistook this for a hefeweizen but the darker color,chewier taste stronger alcohol note gives it away as weizenbock. One of the more impressive offererings from BBC. They should make this a year round beer.
Bluegrass Weizenbock;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Pours dark reddish amber with a thin, mostly receding light tan head. Aroma of bubble gum, spicy phenols, and caramel. Taste is lightly sweet with estery notes of bubble gum and light banana, But overal the beer tends more towards the spicy phenolic side. This is missing the creamy wheat character added by a large percentage of wheat. Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied with lively carbonation. Pretty enjoyable, but I wish there were more esters.

Macs Beer;Olathe, Kansas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;Sample at Parkville Microbrew Festival. Comes a pale gold with a nice white head. Mild aroma of malt and grain. Taste is the same. Very thin. Maybe should stay retired.
Macs Beer;Olathe, Kansas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;This beer is good awful. A friend bought a 12 pack of this when it was still being produced and it tasted like it was 10 years old. Stale and overly sweet like creamed corn. This was one of the first beers I couldn’t finish. Thank god its retired.
Macs Beer;Olathe, Kansas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;"Originally reviewed: 4/9/09. Pours a very thin light gold with a decent finger-width head on top. This ""head"" disappears quicker than I can even get my nose close to smell it. Very bubbly and fizzy. No retention, no lacing. Smells of corn, sour mash, some slight lemon? Very watery brew. I saved this for after I mowed the lawn for the first time this season, figuring it would be a thirst-quencher and not much else. It was just that. Very wet and easily consumed. Not much for flavor. Some sour corn adjuncts there. Some malt, and very little bitterness present. Decent for a lawn-mowing beer, and maybe the beach. But I most likely won’t have this again."
Macs Beer;Olathe, Kansas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;Sampled at the 2009 Parkville Microbrew Festival. Pours a pale yellow with a thin white head. This beer has little aroma and no flavor. If they attempted to make a boring macro style beer, then they succeeded. There is no redeeming quality of note here.
Macs Beer;Olathe, Kansas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;Appearance: Pours out a crystal clear, yellow body with a particularly thin, sparsely bubbly, white head. Smell: A spirit-crushing nose smelling only of grainy light pale malts, cracked corn kernels, and some sweetish cereal hints. Taste: Faint pale malts jumbled up with some sourish corn tastes and a small blip of sweetness. Then, the flavor washes out into a watery void in record time leaving you aghast until you hit the quick, all-too-clean, water-soaked finish. Look ashamed, Mac... look ashamed. Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: A pretty poor product, even right down to the dumpy-looking label. This is a remarkably watery beer. That’s all there is to say, really. I once remarked how watery it was, that’s just how remarkably watery it is.

Macs Beer;Olathe, Kansas, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Flying Monkey Brewing;12oz bottle. Hazy golden-yellow color, thin head. Lemon butterscotch aroma. Lemony, corny, and sweet, with a tangy finish. A dry potentially hoppy crispness, in a really odd almost soda-like fashion, is the real center of this beer. Watery, bad homebrew style with a solid adjunct feel. Mac should be ashamed.

FiftyFifty Donner Party Porter;Truckee, California, United States;Porter;FiftyFifty Brewing Company;Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy, mocha-colored head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste follows the nose, with a nice balance of roasted, caramel malt and some chocolate and coffee notes coming through, as well as just a hint of licorice and earthy/herbal hops as well. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some chocolate and coffee notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. While this may not be particularly bold or complex, it does have a rather nice, mellow balance to it that is quite enjoyable, with the roasted malt and mocha notes staning out particularly and some ligher notes of dark chocolate, licorice and earthy/herbal hops. This is a 6.70% ABV Porter, after all, not an Imperial Stout, and quite a nice example of the style at that.

Dark brown colour with medium light tanned head. Nose is lots of port, malts but no roast. Taste is portorised. Roast comes up, even pretty nice, but only in the aftertaste. Would've imagined this would've aged better.
t Smisje Catherine The Great Imperial Stout;Mater, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij Smisje;Bottle from HomeBrewStuff. Murky brown, lively bottle, huge billowing head. Earthy and smoky aroma. Taste leans towards a quad, figs, licorice. Lightly toasted malts, fruity. Light for a 10% beer. Not a typical stout.
t Smisje Catherine The Great Imperial Stout;Mater, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij Smisje;Bottle, a murky medium brown. Quick livelt light tan head. Strange carmelized malts, light dates and raisons, and a slightly sour tannin bite at the end. Very strange, not a stout, and not good
t Smisje Catherine The Great Imperial Stout;Mater, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij Smisje;"330 ml bottle served in a Belgian snifter. $5.50 at Total Wine. Bottle released considerable pressure when the cap was unsealed, suggesting it might gush, but it was well behaved. It did raise a very tall head in the pour. This reduced to a complete top coat fairly quickly. A cross between a Belgian strong, a Belgian stout and a RIS, the Belgian character is particularly evident in the aroma. No points deducted for style: this is delicious and, besides, the ""Imperial Stout"" on the label may be due to the US distributor. Very good balance and complexity. Overall: recommended."
t Smisje Catherine The Great Imperial Stout;Mater, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij Smisje;Pours a hazy dark brown from the bottle, not like a stout at all. Aroma and taste of sweet caramel malt and fruit Belgian esters. Wtf is this shit. Not an imperial stout at all. Opened two bottles and both equally horrible.
t Smisje Catherine The Great Imperial Stout;Mater, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij Smisje;Bottled, 330ml aged 8 years, donated by Fin, cheers. Black with short lived head. Big, heavy Imperial Stout, there are molasses to the fore along with a sticky dates type flavour. Barley sugar in the yeasty notes, heavy tarry and earthy flavours. Coffee dregs. Rather an unusual result with this one through the ageing.

t Smisje Catherine The Great Imperial Stout;Mater, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij Smisje;This has to be the palest imperial stout I have seen so far. Looks more like a dark barley wine to me. Wow, and the aroma is really like a barley wine. Really yummie though, since I love barley wine. Rasins, prunes, caramel and the likes in the aroma. I like the taste as well though it seems a bit style confused. I like the maltiness that was present in the aroma as well, but I dont quite as much like the sourness it has to it. To me it doesnt really fit the maltiness. If I hadn’t read the label I would have called this a barley wine.
t Smisje Catherine The Great Imperial Stout;Mater, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij Smisje;Copper to umber in color with a giant, creamy, vanilla colored head. Solid sheet of lace. Toasted and acid dark malt scents. Hints of herbs and alcohol. As I pour the last of the bottle, some real sludge at the bottom of this one. Now its appearance is murky brown with fish food adrift. A smoky malt profile. Light and quite airy in feel. A savory brew, but not a dark roasted malt stout. This has more qualities of a either a traditional, Belgian strong or barley wine. Certainly has its complexities. Ok, perhaps a quad. I seem to be searching for more. Vinous towards the end. I find myself taking smaller quaffs to limit the overload. Perhaps I am not worthy, to steal a line from Stone. 2/10
t Smisje Catherine The Great Imperial Stout;Mater, Belgium;Stout - Imperial;Brouwerij Smisje;From a 33 cl bottle. Pours a cloudy brown with a thick bubbly tan head. Somewhat herbal nose. Flavors of caramel. Lots of carbonation. Slightly bitter finish.

Entirely flat, leading to a dull mouthfeel. Prominent toffee and butterscotch in the aroma, which was certainly not appropriate for the style. Touches of grassy hop on the palate but its all a bit thin. Not properly conditioned din my view. A shame as this was my first beer from this quite new brewery. Re-rate if possible. Shown as 3.8% in the festival list but 3.9% on the brewery website.

Rock Bottom Warrenville Terminal Oatmeal Stout;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Warrenville;Sample at brewpub-Pours a dark brown/light black with a nice tan head. Aroma of chocolate and sweetness. Taste of the same with a bit of coffee added. This was a great tasting medium bodied brew. Nice job.
Rock Bottom Warrenville Terminal Oatmeal Stout;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Warrenville;Sampled on tap at the brewpub (Warrenville, IL). Pours a pitch black opaque pour, a creamy light brown head sits atop and seems very nitro, laces well. Aromas are lighter, preaching the way of a dry nitro stout, irish soda bread, roasted malts, a touch of creamy vanilla and lighter chocolate underneath. Initial is nitro, but sweeter, chocolate and lactose come into play, some coffee behind but not dominant based on the sweetness factor. Comes in stronger, coupled with roasted malts, a decent sweetness, caramel underneath. A bit sweet for my tastes, but originally the aroma made me believe this would be a dry stout.. Not the case in my opinion. A nice even keeled stout, aimed slightly stronger to the sweeter side.. Finishes with chocolate, roast, a touch of coffee. Good.
Rock Bottom Warrenville Terminal Oatmeal Stout;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Rock Bottom Warrenville;4oz. sampler at Warrenville. Appeared black/brown in the glass, with a creamy, tan head that retained its size for quite a while and some nice, clingy lace. The aroma offered some roasted coffee, a touch of bakers chocolate, and a wisp of smoke. These continued into the flavor with a hint of tobacco and pronounced hop bitterness. Medium to full body, with a silky texture. The sample finished dry, and as it warmed, I found a hint of malty sweetness at the end.

The nose is fairly light and smells of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and lightly roasted malts. Very creamy mouthfeel. It tastes pretty much as it smells, but the flavors are stronger than the aroma. A mild nutty bitterness builds near the finish, which is dry. Not bad. Rock Bottom Warrenville, Warrenville, IL
Rock Bottom Warrenville American Dream Imperial IPA;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Bottom Warrenville;I did not know this was a DIPA when I got, it seemed more of a standard west coast IPA with the potent grapefruit, citrus, and pine coming out in the nose and the flavor. Pale, deep golden appearance with a foamy white head. Quite dry in the mouth, soaphy with a medium foamy feel. Okay. Honestly not my favorite approach to I or II/PA.

Rock Bottom Warrenville American Dream Imperial IPA;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Rock Bottom Warrenville;I can’t let a DIPA in the Chicago region escape my notice, and this one justified my drive to the western ’burbs. It has a cloudy light amber body with a short-lived off-white head. Solid lacing, regardless. Served way too cold, I had to wait a while for the strong PNW hops to assault my nose. Grapefruit, lemon zest, pine... pretty much what I had hoped for. There’s a light caramel sweetness in the flavor, but it’s quickly overridden by the sharp hoppy bitterness, which has an addition of a sprinkle of black pepper. The finish is a satisfying, prolonged citrusy bitterness. Not too shabby. Exceptional with organic omlet of market fresh snow peas, artisan salami, local tomme and heirloom tomatoes sauteed in butter and finished with a splash of stout. That bit of wisdom from Mr. Finkel, truly a justifiably named legend in the beer world, may or may not hold true for this beer. I included it because it’s one of the silliest pairings I’ve read in a long, long time. Sue me! Rock Bottom Warrenville, Warrenville, IL

Rock Bottom Warrenville Happy Pils;Warrenville, Illinois, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Rock Bottom Warrenville;"""Chill well and serve with the devilled eggs at your next picnic."" - Steve Beaumont I wanted to like this beer, but the warmer it got, the less it satisfied. Looked nice poured from the tap, a bright yellow with copious beading and a creamy head that laced in sheets. But the aroma held a strong buttery smell that overshadowed the initial whiffs of bready malts and grassy hops. Similarly, the flavor began with with tastes of bread dough and a sharp hop bitterness, but that got lost to the runny butter as it warmed. Still, it finished on a nice bitter note. But I would only drink this at very cold temperatures. ILLINOIS RATING NUMBER 666 (out of 3599)!!!!! Rock Bottom Warrenville, Warrenville, IL"

Straw. Pears. Honey. Long finish. Spritzy."" Thrilling stuff eh?"
Emerson's JP (2007);Dunedin, New Zealand;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Emerson's Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours golden orange. Shared with donfardz64. Nose is of sweet, ripe orange and honey. Strong floral notes which are dominated by rose scents. Herbs like coriander mixed with spice, mainly clove. Some straw-like malt and resiny hops. Flavours began with an orange punch, with clove spice, cinnamon and alcohol, rendering this beer very warming indeed. Not a whole lot of body, but still amazing with it’s immense honey sweetness, balanced by a zesty, citrus bitterness. Flowery, rose and herb nose is lasting. Nicely crafted NZ example of a tripel, but a few rough edges.

Bottle kindly shared from sdriessen. Pours a slight cloudy golden with a fizzy white head that dissipates. Strong sweet aromas of clove, corriander, caramel, citrus fruit and vanilla. Very characteristic of a Tripel. Light bodied flavour, warming alcohol and spice. Clove and orange peel dominate the flavour, sweet caramel like flavours ending with a bitter twang. Finish is bitter, dry and medium length. Best NZ made Tripel I’ve had to date, very nice but missing a few things.

Elliott Bay Old Pilot Porter;Seattle, Washington, United States;Porter;Elliott Bay Brewing Company;On nitrous at the Burien brewery. Aroma is light, with faint roast malt character. Appearance is dark brown with a very well retained white head. Flavor is light as well, with cream flavors, low malt and roast character. Mouthfeel is low in character with very little carb feel and no grain or roast feel. This is almost not to style, not sure if just upping the ingredients would help, since the appearance already shows a lot of non-fementables.

Mountaineer Nut Brown Ale;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;"""pretty typical brown ale...light caramel and chocolate in the aroma, and juuuust a touch of hops in the finish to let you know they’re there. light in body and flavor, but nice."""
Mountaineer Nut Brown Ale;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;Rated on 5-30-2009 (Bottle) This beer pours a small off-white head, transparent reddish brown body, very little lacing and very little carbonation observed. The Aroma is chocolate malt, nutty, lightly roasty, and lightly hoppy. The Taste mimics the Aroma. The Palate is tingly and this beer is medium bodied. Overall, this beer is easy to drink, but the flavors just did not come together as they should have. There is no WOW factor with this beer and it left me not putting it on my list of beers that I would drink again.

Mountaineer Nut Brown Ale;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;12oz bottle. Medium brownish amber in color with a small off-white head. Really nutty aroma, like a teabag almost with how many nuts there are. The flavor is surprisingly not bad. Big nuts, pecan and hazelnut, with some caramel malts but a weaker finish. A bit thin on the palate with average carbonation. Not bad actually. The best I’ve had from Mountaineer.
Mountaineer Nut Brown Ale;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;Not bad for the style--the chocolate malt is a nice addition, the nuttiness is highly pronounced, and the hops a bit restrained for style and origin. Drinkable! (local gas station, Fayetteville, Fayette Co.)

Aroma of raisin, toasted malt, a bit of butter. Blah. Flavor of roasted grains and sour apple. I was afraid it was infected. Once you get past the sour, it finishes with a chocolate malt character.
Mountaineer Nut Brown Ale;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Brown Ale;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;A nice, mild brown ale perfect for drinking a few. A short-lived fizzy head, with a wonderful malty, nutty, chocolate aroma. The taste is disappointing with malty and nutty flavors dominating. It sits watery and light bodied in the mouth and finsishes with very subtle roasted flavors, with woodsy nut flavors continuing. Overall it is, simply, a good brown ale.

Spinnakers Irish Summer Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Spinnakers Brewpub;Pours a very dark amber with very loose large bubbles on the top - no retention. Aroma is quite sweet. Tastes very thin with a nice maltiness to it, more of a sweet-stout than a dry one. Carb minimal, body thin and water. With a few alterations could make a nice porter.
Spinnakers Irish Summer Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Spinnakers Brewpub;Draught at the brewpubBlack body with light tan head. Good sugars and roast on the nose. I was immediately put off on the first sip by the tartness...I wasn’t expecting that. Once I knew what I was getting into, though, the beer came round nicely. Roasty, tart, with soft chocolatey malts. Very refreshing finish. Light body, too. This really drinks like a 4% stout, which in the summer it probably ought to be, but either way it’s a very nice stout, something we don’t get enough of in BC.
Spinnakers Irish Summer Stout;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Dry;Spinnakers Brewpub;"(Draught) Pours a thin dissipated, tan head with an opaque body. Aroma of molasses and chocolate roast . Compared to the Irish Stout, the summer-version seemingly is thiner in texture and has a more balanced malt to hop ratio. I also found there to be an interesting apple skin flavour along the mid-palate. Good balance but on the ""light + slight"" side for my taste buds. (Re-rate) Sampled on cask at the Spinnakers Brewpub on July 6, 2008. Pours a thin, almond web atop of a deep, near opaque, brown body. Nose of mild chocolate malt. Somewhat tart, flavour of thin watery coffee. Bland, boring and in need of a palate-booster."
Hugos Blackberry Hefeweizen;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Hugos;(Draught) Pours a thin, dissipating foamy white head with a light amber body. Tart nose. The flavour is mildly milky with a blackberry seed undertone. Too sour to pair with a hefeweizen, IMO.

Jolly Pumpkin La Roja Du Kriek;Dexter, Michigan, United States;Sour/Wild - Dark;Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales;"Bottle Date 2/2/2016; Sample June 2016 Quickly after popping the cap the beer foams up and gets all over the place; wonderful. A steady pour into my glass produces a fat-two-finger thick, pale-amber tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a deep red-amber color that shows a sediment / floaty laden, hazy, golden tinged, red-amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells tart, certainly fruity, but with a solid funkiness to it as well. Phenolic, musty, a bit musky, with lots of berry, cherry, and floral notes (rose, and carnation come to mind, as well as perhaps a touch of hibiscus), light touches of nutty brown grain notes, some toasted whole grain bread aromatics. The oak adds aromas of toasted wood, bits of vanillin, perhaps even a touch of coconut, the last two accentuate, and meld into the fruit aromatics that are found in the nose. Still fairly carbonated, the beer is actually fairly light bodied, though it is not thin. The finish has an oak dominated astringency, as well as a light sourness, and a lingering, floral fruit character. The fruit flavors, and the tartness boost a perceived sweetness here, but there is very little actual sugar sweetness to this beer. Astringent, tannic notes are noticeable throughout each sip, definitely from the oak, but perhaps also from the cherries, this melds well with a phenolic, funky, not quite plastic, definitely musty, not quite musky Brettanomyces signature. There is a soft, rounded malt character here that is a touch nutty (light oxidation), hints of sherry perhaps (brought out by the oak), with just a bit of whole grain cracker / toast flavors to add some subtle complexity. Rounded vanillin notes, and perhaps some toasted coconut flavors from the oak character meld into the soft fruitiness found in the flavor. As the beer warms up and loses some of the carbonation it picks up a bit more heft, it clings to the palate just a touch, though is still quite quaffable. The cherry character here is fairly soft, it definitely plays a supporting role, though is still quite noticeable; I am just enjoying that it does not completely dominate the base beer here. This is a very enjoyable beer, it doesn't hit you over the head, and I find I need to really slow down and spend time with this beer to maximize my enjoyment; it fits the day though, an early season thunderstorm just finished moving through, and has cooled off what was a 100+°F day here."

The aroma has notes of black cherry, espresso, black and caramel malt, grassy and herbal hops, and even a little peaty. The taste is quite complex, bitter and biting at one moment then sweet and fruity the next. I too get a note of bourbon and oak as well on the finish. Mocha, vanilla, apple, and coffee flavors add to the overall enjoyment of this tasty Impy. The feel is oily and lush, heavy but not so much it interfered with me drinking the first sample way too quick! I love it and want more even if it still has an edge about it.

Big Rock Chop House Flying Buffalo Imperial Stout;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;12oz Bottle. Thanks Sean! First snow here in Rhode Island, so I’m ready for something thick, oily and viscous. I didn’t know what to expect, even though I’ve had the super-oaky barrel-aged versions. This was intensely delicious! A balanced, rich array of complex toasty, roasted, charred, and brown flavors. Lots of near-vinous fruit-like characters combined with a fantastic, silk and velvet tongue. Extremely sippable. A great, balanced and intensely flavorful stout!

Okhotsk Mild Stout;Kitami-shi, Japan;Stout - Dry;Okhotsk Beer;Bottle, mail ordered from Hokkaido. Man, was that expensive! Roasted malt aroma with coffee, a bit of dark fruit. Dry, mild, smooth. Black with a lacy tan head. It lets some light through. Slightly sweet, roasty, flavor. Rather fruity, but then a woody, smoky and roasted finish takes over. Bitterness lingers a long time. Light bodied (a bit too light) and flavored. That subtle but unmistakable tart fruitiness is strange and interesting. As the label says, it is very mild. Well balanced, crisp, dry finish. I doubt Jackson would include it in his top 500 if it was done today, but it is still a decent dry stout. Yes, licorice too.

Thanks, Brian! Pours a cloudy orange with no head. There’s still plenty of cherry character in this, along with leather, funk, yogurt, lemon, grapes - a little muddled, but not bad. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation and a tart, funky mouthfeel. The last four ratings are really brutal, but they must have gotten a bad batch or this beer isn’t as good as it used to be. The older vintage I had is still pretty nice."
Big Rock Chop House Michigan Sour Cherry Tripel;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Had this on tap. Horrible. Terrible and abrasive aroma, almost like acetone. Taste was very astringent, not at all fruity, almost like cough syrup. Will not try again.
Big Rock Chop House Michigan Sour Cherry Tripel;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;WOW... Pours a flattish amber color with very minimal white head. Aroma is cheap vodka, nail pollish remover, dumpster, and robitussin. Taste is vile and putrid. Tastes like poison. I took my first sip and it was Three Olives brand Hot Trash Vodka. The second sip, which was all i could stomache, was more of the same. This is a whole new level of bad.

Big Rock Chop House Michigan Sour Cherry Tripel;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;Bottle thanks to mikem409. Pours a deep, slightly golden red with a small off-white head. Aroma is very vinous, boozy, some cider and cherry aromas, a lot of alcohol. Taste is just awful, almost nothing but alcohol and some stale cherry flavor, not much more to say on this one. This beer has decent ratings so maybe it’s just a bad bottle, but this is a drain pour for me.

Wapping Magna 800;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wapping;Cask, Wirral Food & Drink Festival. Darkish, hazy golden colour with next to no head. Some vague citrus and hop lurking here, but something not quite right in the flavour, like an unpleasant almost stale sourness which spoilt this rather for me. Finishes dry and ok but on the whole not great at all.
Wapping Magna 800;Liverpool, Merseyside, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wapping;[i] [b] Bottle, many thanks to Ian Harrisoni for this beer, cheers mate. [/i] [/b] Pours light golden with barely any head other than a tiny rim of white bubbles. Some preserved lemon noticed on the nose, there a few tiny yeast particles but nothing too worry about and they are all the bottom of the glass, in fact the beer has pretty good clarity. Nice soft lemony taste, this would be very refreshing if served straight from the fridge in the summer, but still it’s a very nice drop, quite tangy, some hops, it’s a subtle but nonetheless pretty impressive beer.

Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;Wow this one was foul. Like an alcohol swab mixed with bad/harsh sake. Not really fruity at all. Just hurt to drink. Bleck.
Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;330ml bottle from Waitrose, Rickmansworth in 2017. Clear golden colour, head dissipated completely. These beers have always had a strong aroma/flavour of apple juice. Does have some of the fruitier triple notes, but still doesn't taste wholly beer-like.
Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;Cloudy, yellow colour with a frothy white head. Light hay aroma. Weird sweet taste, really strange. Low medium body and carbonation, smooth mouthfeel.
Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;Off white rocky head soon left flotsam on a hazy light copper coloured, finely carbonated body. Minimal aroma of citrus & saccharin. Medium bodied, highly effervescent with cloying back. Tinned fruit juices, orange, sweet citrus & cordial tastes. Pretty poor stuff

Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;A small taste from a friend (bottle) @ Belge. Pours clear golden with a medium head. Aroma is sweet malts with some boozy apples. Flavor is similar with a hoppy finish. Strange. Cidery.
Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;I can understand why some people may not be thrilled with this beer. But I have been eating a gluten free diet for over four years--though happily, most beer doesn't bother me the way bread and pasta do--and so the attempt to create interesting gluten free beers makes me happy and appreciative, knowing many people who are celiac, not just gluten-sensitive. In this case, I think this is a respectable beer. It pours with a big, loosely formed lace (not my preference) on a moderately dark golden body. Yeasty nose, giving way to a flavor mix of alcohol, apples, and bread dough. The finish strikes me as sweeter. Moderate body, fading carbonation. Decent, if you like the apple note--and I'm o.k. with that. Bottle.
Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;From the 500 ml bottle with an expiration date of 09/01/22. Attractive, heady golden colored pour. The white head is fluffy and lingering and there is decent clarity. The aroma expresses notes of apple, barnyard, Belgian bready or caramel malts, herbal, and citrus. The body is around medium. Considering this is Gluten-free, the taste has a sweet sensation with a caramel character and a mild but slightly zesty bitterness to end. I think it is a decently done Gluten-free beer.
Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;330ml bottle. As Green's triple ale. Golden colour, white foam head leaving some lacing and aroma of cola, caramel, fudge. Taste is sweet, earthy grain, yeast extract, vegetal, some caramel and bitterness. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, tangy finish. OK.
Green's Quest;Stockport, Greater Manchester, England;Specialty Grain - Other;Green's Belgian Ales;Hooray for power! 500-ml Bottle from World Market. Pours golden with a small off-white head. Aroma is slightly sour apple, sorghum. Flavor is very weird... I guess that's the sorghum giving it this odd flavor, along with rotten apple, rubbing alcohol, yeast, grass. I'd never drink this again.

Broughton Excisemans 80/- (Bottle);Biggar, Scotland;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Broughton Ales;Bottle at home. It pours a reddish brown, with a foamy froth which quickly subsides. Nose is very traditional, with lots of sweet malt, a bit nutty, some gristy cereal notes. Taste is sweet, light treacle. Palate is the least good thing about it, very short in the finish. Still, a good traditional 80/-. If I went into some random pub I’d be pleased to see this on tap.

Thin body leaves no trace in the mouth, but decent carb - perhaps too much. This beer is interesting but, again, too thin and lacking in wheat character.

Good to enjoy outdoors.

Dogfish Head Johnny Rawton Pils;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dogfish Head Brewery;Rating from memory. On tap at the alehouse in Gaithersburg. Crystal clear appearance. Very refreshing and crisp. A nice pilsner. Do they still make this one? If not they should.
Dogfish Head Johnny Rawton Pils;Milton, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Dogfish Head Brewery;This is definitely one of the best pilseners ever to have been brewed. It’s not your conventional pils, either. It pours a hazy and cloudy light golden color with a decent sized white head that leaves a nice amount of lacing around the glass. The nose is full of spicy and floral hops. The body is smooth, creamy and incredibly drinkable. The flavors are very hoppy, as well, with a nice crispness and malty backbone. I wonder if this beer took the place of their Prescription Pils (which evidentially doesn’t exist any more on RateBeer, for some reason). I remember that Pils being just a tad-bit better. This, nonetheless, is great on its own!

Pours a very hazy yellowish-golden color with a big fluffy white head and a good amount of lacing. Very hazy throughout. Kind of strange for the style, but I’m guessing Dogfish didn’t really intend this to be just an American Pale Lager, so I’m going to go with it looks good. The nose is pretty nice with some bright citrus aroma and a bit of mild bready sweetness. Good hops. The taste lets back a bit from that but the combination of citrus and bitterness is quite nice. A good tone of bitterness throughout. Body is fairly light and this is quite drinkable. Solid beer. Serving type: growler Reviewed on: 01-20-2011

Hecks Portwine Of Glastonbury SV (Draught);Street, Somerset, England;Apple Cider;Hecks Farmhouse Cider;"Draught (Cambridge Blue, Cambridge) as ""Hecks Portwine Medium Sweet"" at 6.5% Misty orange, no head. Beautifully fruity aroma, some lovely sharpness as well as the rich sweet fruitiness. Taste is dangerous, according to Anna, but I disagree - I think it’s magnificent. We agree to compromise on ""sublime"". Beautifully soft palate. Right now, this is saying ""best cider ever"" to me. It may be sweet but it’s utterly delicious, and gloriously drinkable. Aged so gracefully, presumably in wood from the mellowness. Palate is just right, it has just the right amount of sharpness to balance the sweetness. Wow."

Aroma of sweet red apples, tart apples, light wood and funk. Flavour is moderate to heavy sweet and light acidic. Real soft sweet red apple palate. Medium bodied with flat carbonation.

Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt Schwanenweisse;Ebermannstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Schwanen Bräu Ebermannstadt;My Bottom Line: Tons of banana esters grace this Weizen’s rising spicy phenols, as light acidity increases drinkability. Further Personal Perceptions: -A sheet of foam tops the cloudy yellow. -Drinkability is quite high. -This was the most professional brews of theirs the day we visited. -Citrusy acidity is often a nice touch on a Weissbier.

Lunar Luna Lager;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lunar Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. This is what other pale lagers and premium lagers wished they could be. A hazy yellow body with a white head. The aroma was malty with some vegetable character. I got some carrots and biscuit. The taste was vegetable with some carrots and a nice spicy finish. Clean and refreshing. Pretty much as good as this style can get.
Lunar Luna Lager;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lunar Brewing Company;Well, if I ever liked a lager its this one. Like most lagers, a pale gold pour with a thin head. Watery mouthfeel. But surprisingly - (due to the style - not Lunar’s rep) no skunk in the nose, no coppery aftertaste. An interesting hoppy note that is absent in most lagers. Good job with a terrible style!
Lunar Luna Lager;Villa Park, Illinois, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lunar Brewing Company;From the tap this pours a golden body with a head that performs some intricate lacing... typical for a Lunar brew. The aroma has bready malts and a mild grassy herbal bitterness, as does the taste. The bittering hops intensify as the drink warms, making this a pretty refreshing Summertime beer.

Aroma is biscuity with citrus tones and a fennel-coriander type spiciness. Flavor is toasty-wheaty-biscuity up front with aromatic herbal hopping and light citrus tone, starts drying up mid way and finishes with a dry tartness and a light bittering almost puckering...great stuff!. Dry, spritzy, spicey, citrusy, refreshing great rendition of the style and the closest flavor profile to Hoegaarten I’ve tasted from local brewers of the style.

Big Rock Chop House Reserve Farmhouse Ale;Birmingham, Michigan, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Big Rock Chop House & Brewery;"Sampled April 2009 A standard pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a fat-two-finger thick, tanned head. The beer is a murky amber color that shows quite a bit of haze (this despite a month long rest in the fridge), and an amber tinged, copper highlighted color when held up to the light. The aroma has a sweet fruitiness to it that reminds me of a combination of pear, honeydew melon, ripe plums and a berry / raisin note. This has a backdrop of malt character that adds caramelized notes as well as a solid biscuit like note. A musty, earthy note plays a secondary role here. Coming back to the nose after a bit has me noticeing an interesting kiwi note as well as other tart fruit aromas. The taste is fruity up front, but quickly picks up a nice lactic tartness through the finish. A fizzy carbonation provides an effervescent prickle as it roles across the tongue, which helps to lighten the body up. This beer is pretty dry, but has more body to it than the dryness will suggest. The beer has a tannic, spicy oak like character to it in the finish (though I wouldn’t necessarily say this was actually aged with oak). The fruitiness and tartness combines to suggest flavors of sour plums, berries and lots of tamarind like flavors. The finish has a touch of acetic character to it that helps to spice things up a bit. This is quite nice, I forgot that this was a sour beer; so I was expecting a Saison’ish thing; and am pleasantly surprised by the Flemish Sour like beer that ended up in my glass. The beer is perhaps a touch too fizzy from the ample carbonation, but this is easily remedied by some aggressive swirling. This is a very nice beer that I am quite happy to be drinking."

Pike Bitter (FSB);Seattle, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Pike Brewing Company;Clear golden color sampler at brewpub. Very dusty and mossy aroma. Almost too British.

Johansson's Pale Ale;Westminster, Maryland, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Johansson's Dining House;Pint at the brewery. 20-30% opaque, amber-orange colored body with a decently sized off-white head, about 1/2 inch thick and sturdy. Nose of pleasent pine sap and fruity C-note hops, clean, not muddled by yeast like other Johansson’s beer, and even sticky and a little bit dank. Reminds me of SNPA, and in fact I might say this could be a clone of that recipe, since it’s actually common for smaller brewpubs to emulate Sierra Nevada for this style. I’ve tasted it before all over the country. This one tastes fairly close - clean and oily, almost, snappy pine flavored hops and a clean but tasty malt bill, some cedar wood and biscuit malts (light), and again, a noticeable lack of the muddy yeast. I like it.

Banks's Brightside;Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Banks's (Marston's);Cask conditioned @ Duke of Wellington, Soton. Pale. Very sweet and sticky with overripe fruity flavours and offputting spicy liquorice. Lacking in hop balance. A low alcohol beer with the flavour profile of high octane tramp juice. Rubbish.
Downton Swelter;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Downton Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Masons Arms, Oxford. Pale straw with no head. This was just put on so couldn’t have been fresher, but what a poor beer. Initial big eggy smell, heavy burtonisation I would think, then a chemical, perfumed body masking the flavours I would have expected, it was not popular in a pub full of Ale drinkers.
Downton Swelter;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Downton Brewery;Draught at The Rake, London. Pale golden with almost no head. Good hoppy nose with apples. Flavours are well-balanced, fruity, ending dry. Rather flat. I have tasted better from Downton.
Downton Swelter;Salisbury, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Downton Brewery;Cask conditioned @ Waterloo Arms, Soton. Pale colour. Light firm malt flavours and lots of grassy herbal hops which leads into a good bitter finish with an almost piney quality. Not especially germanic in quality (germanic script and german flag colours on pumpclip) but perhaps a twist on some of those flavours. Very good and drinkable.

Trout River Doppelsticke;Springfield, Vermont, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Trout River Brewing Company;"6 ounce draught sample at the Vermont Brewer’s Fest (July 2007). Dusky caramel-mahogany color with a hint of foam....nose is lightly grainy, mostly caramel, perhaps a faint hint of dried fruit (prunes)....like the other TR beers I tried at the fest, there’s nothing wrong with the aroma here, though this one isn’t exciting, but when you get to taste....it’s very, very sweet, sticky even, lightly nutty and a touch fruity (grapy) with some alcohol warming....and like the doppel and weizenbocks, a bit sour at the finish, lacto perhaps but definitely doesn’t seem to be what it should be; also rather cardboardy and too low in the carbonation."
Zero Gravity Belgian Dubbel;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Dubbel;Zero Gravity Craft Brewery;Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a ruddy dark yet burnt purple almost brown color with a thin white foamy head that dissipated evenly. Lingering sticky lace. The aroma bleeds Belgian spiced fruit. Yeasty effects take some place with a light bready to semi-white pepper background. The flavor balances between the yeasty/breadiness and hits the fruit and the spice fairly decent. No aftertaste but it does have a quick sweet yeasty sort of finish. On the palate, this one was about medium in body with a fair crisp carbonation about it. Bready malts slide over in a smooth fashion on my tongue. Overall, decent Americanized dubbel that I could have again.

Aroma of crispy German hops, slightly soapy and with some citrus hops. Flavor is very bitter, with lemon peel, anise and some spices.

Einhundert 100 Bitterpils;Uttendorf, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Vitzthum;"Hopfig-herber Geruch. Hopfiger Antrunk, sogar etwas süß, dann wird das Bier Schritt für Schritt langsam bitterer. Der Mittelteil ist bereits überdurchschnittlich bitter aber erst im Nachgeschmack ist das ""100"" zu erkennen. Nebenbei ist das Bier allerdings auch noch dezent hopfig und würzig. Netter Versuch.

Einhundert 100 Bitterpils;Uttendorf, Austria;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Privatbrauerei Vitzthum;Bottle shared with the in-law. Wow! Holy-180-Batman! This beer smells like a pils and tastes like a pils UNTIL the aftertaste kicks in. This beer earns high marks simply for it’s ability to end the sip with no aftertaste that turns into such a bitter, lingering effect (I wouldn’t even call it a ’flavor’) you don’t expect... and then stays with you for a long time. A truly unique beer.

Fox River Breakfast Stout;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Fox River Brewing Company;12oz bottle. The aroma isn’t so bad, chocolate and specialty malt is an ally of the shabby brewer. Opaque brown black, bit sugary sweet chocolate tinged aroma. Is actually a drinkable product, not up to par, but drinkable and acceptable. Chocolate, caramel, toasty vanilla graham cracker. The flavors aren’t bad, but the body is lifeless, lacks depth or brewing finesse. Brown sugar malta.

Fox River Breakfast Stout;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Fox River Brewing Company;On tap at GTMW. Poured medium iced tea brown with a tall cap of beige head.. crystal-clear. The aroma picked up artificially-sweetened caramel and milky chocolates with a touch of vanilla.. smelled a bit cheap, but was non-offensive. The flavor found sweet milky notes, chocolate, and toasty black malts accented by vanilla and light smoke.. too sweet for my liking. Medium-bodied with high carbonation on the palate.. not great, but serviceable.
Fox River Breakfast Stout;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Fox River Brewing Company;Sampled on draught at the GTMW ’08. Pours a semi-clear dark brown brew with a thin beige head that slowly dissipates to a fine film and thin off-white ring. Aroma of mostly roasted dark coffee and a little dark malt in the background. Taste has more character than its aroma with flavors of toasted dark malt, coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla and some roasted nuts. Finish has mostly a semi-sweet coffee aftertaste but the flavor disappears quite fast.
Fox River Breakfast Stout;Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States;Stout;Fox River Brewing Company;Basing this soley on the style, very dissapointing. However overall a decent refreshing beer. Pours an almost clear reddish brown colour with a small tan head. Aroma is sweet, nutty- with light milk chocolate, roasted nuts and coffee beans. Flavors are delightful, creamy, vanilla and coffee notes. Like i said, nice beer- just way too weak for the style.

Raccoon Lodge Hyper Hop;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Brewing;Big hops aroma. Cloudy gold color, and a large, rocky white head. It is a fine looking beer. Unfortunately the flavor is not as good as the aroma or the appearance. Very light citrus hops. It might be old. Medium palate. I think it would be really good and flavorful fresh.

Raccoon Lodge Hyper Hop;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Brewing;Picked up a 22-oz bomber from the Raccoon Lodge, west of downtown Portland, OR.

Raccoon Lodge Hyper Hop;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Brewing;Sampled a pint of this one on draught at the brewpub in Portland, OR. This beer pours to a slightly hazy, deep golden to orange color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a good carbonation. The nose in outstanding, with big, pungent aromas, of pine, lemon, and grapefruit. The palate is firm, with good pale and biscuit malt flavors, with a very good, tangy, grapefruit hop flavor. This beer finishes with good pale malt and hop flavors up front, then ends with a very, long, dry, very zesty piney/cirtus hop bitterness that lingers for quite some time. This beer just screams PNW hops, and is what AIPA is truly all about. Big hop aromas, big hop flavors, big hop bitterness. Packed with character, yet still a very drinkable beer that you could enjoy a few pints of, and a beer that would work well with the spicy fare on the menu.
Raccoon Lodge Hyper Hop;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;Cascade Brewing;Bottle courtesy of a travelling friend.

The finish is dry and equal parts hops and malt. Pretty enjoyable overall.

Blackfriars Yarmouth Bitter;Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Blackfriars;"Cask - The Kings Head, Norwich. Bubbly, medium sized & lasting white head; clear orange body. There was a presiding element to the whole profile of this beer than I couldn’t put my finger on. Glue? Plastic? Overripe fruit? Earth & red fruit aromas.

It wasn’t undrinkable but rather off-putting to a degree."

Sheffield Blanco Blonde;Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sheffield Brewery;Cask. Rutland Arms, Sheffield. Clear, pale gold. Bubbly, messy, white head. This has a lot a Czech Pils might have. It’s aromatic, and clean, and a bit spicy. But then it’s been put in a cask, and served through a hand pump, which for me, has rendered it dull, and a bit hard work. There’s a decent beer in there somewhere.

Arcadia Hop Rocket;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Arcadia Brewing Company;A nice malt and hop nose but a pretty thin taste profile. There is some hop bitterness, booziness and caramel malt with a touch of strawberry. Middle of the pack.
Arcadia Hop Rocket;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Arcadia Brewing Company;"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 5-4-16. Fresh, citric aroma. Lemon and orange scents. Also peach and yellow plum (pitted fruit). Smells like a citric-flavored Toaster Strudel and dessert wine. Clear gold with some effervescence. Some haze in the final pour. Small amount of short-lasting, beige head. Simultaneously hoppy and malty. Sweet, malty taste: Marshmallow. Orange flavor; also tangerine and peach. Lightly bitter finish, but, overall, this beer is well on the sweet side for the style. It’s not cloyingly sweet, however. Medium to full body. Lively in the palate. Overall, underwhelming. Too sweet and inoffensive, like so many other IPAs today. Rating number 2001."
Arcadia Hop Rocket;Battle Creek, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Arcadia Brewing Company;Originally listed as Arcadia Hop Rocket 11th Anniversary Ale. Lightly hazed light amber color. Small diminished head of off-white bubbles. Orange citrus, resinous nose. Light fruit also in the background and a hint of caramel. Full, not quite mouth coating feel. Light fruit in the front. Some caramel and pepper gradually work their way in. Citric, acidic and a bit overbearing at times. Stomach is warming. Sometimes stronger is not better. Lacks balance. 3/10

Kinver Khyber IPA;Kinver, Staffordshire, England;IPA;Kinver Brewery;Grassy hop aroma, this has some malt sweetness , and a good bitter finish . More of a new style IPA than a blond. Good stuff.
Kinver Khyber IPA;Kinver, Staffordshire, England;IPA;Kinver Brewery;Bottle. My first from this fairly local brewery.Slightly cloudy yellow. Some hops with a trace of sulphur. Bitterness creeps in but that sulphur makes it a bit edgy. Reasonable but could have been better.
Kinver Khyber IPA;Kinver, Staffordshire, England;IPA;Kinver Brewery;So much head it was laughable - a good two inches proud of the glass at one point. Smell and taste is all sour wheat which I guess is the yeast as this isn’t a wheat beer. For me this is just nowhere near the advertised style and was tempted to mark it lower. Disappointed as this brewery can turn out some good stuff.
Kinver Khyber IPA;Kinver, Staffordshire, England;IPA;Kinver Brewery;Bottle from Saucy Pears. Appearance - very lively head. Golden. Nose - lightly funky, lemon. Taste - lemon custard, yoghurt. Light grassiness. Palate - close to medium bodied with a creamy yet tangy texture and a fairly good finish. Overall - the yeast note is too dominant. Is this what the brewer intended?
Kinver Khyber IPA;Kinver, Staffordshire, England;IPA;Kinver Brewery;500ml bottle: shared with Tony, the bloke who brought this to the 3rd De Bierboom Bottle Exchange on 6th Feb 2015. Golden pour with a good, clean white blanket on top. The nose has citrus hoppiness and a mild malty molasses undertone, the taste follows in the same way: a nice blend of ingredients that marry together well. Couldn’t write any more: the night had just began and there were some monsters to conquer.
Kinver Khyber IPA;Kinver, Staffordshire, England;IPA;Kinver Brewery;Bottle from York Beer & Wine. Hazy golden coloured with sweet toffee and grassy flavours with bitter peppery hops on the finish.
Crested Butte Jokerville IPA;Englewood, Colorado, United States;IPA;Crested Butte Brewing;Draft. 6.2% ABV, 60 IBU, Chinook and Willamette per the Brewery in Gunnison. Pours a medium lasting white head, with extensive lacing, over a slightly hazy light amber (SRM 7) body....nose is light toffee/caramel, light hop spice....taste is toffee/caramel malts tones to start, with light cereal, then very light citrus and pine, with a medium bitter finish...mouth feel is medium, carbonation medium. This is a lighter take on an IPA, with some of the mellower characteristics of an ESB. The nose, as served, is too light for an IPA. However, the hops do not dominate the malts as in many, making for a nicely balanced and easy drinking pint. BJCP 7/3/13/4/6
Crested Butte Jokerville IPA;Englewood, Colorado, United States;IPA;Crested Butte Brewing;Bottle. Pours hazy tawny with a small, rocky, frothy, off-white head, diminishing with spare lacing.

Medium bodied, oily texture, soft carbonation, and a sweet, bitter finish. Average duration, moderate sweetness, light acidity, and heavy bitterness. Candied hop and fruit flavor mixed with toasted grains.
Crested Butte Jokerville IPA;Englewood, Colorado, United States;IPA;Crested Butte Brewing;Lightly dusty apricot color. Pine, citrus and resin on the wonderful nose. Big upfront hop flavor...very piney and resiny. Ends with anice drying pithy grapefruit flavor. The hops really stick around the whole time (Willamette and Cascade)...long after taste. Darn good beer from Greg.

Malvern Hills Priessnitz;Malvern, Worcestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Malvern Hills Brewery;Hand-pulled pint in the lovely ’Little Pack Horse’ Bewdley on 22nd Feb 2014. Looks every inch a pilsner/lager: white head on a clear golden body. Also odourless, just like most pilsners/lagers. Grainy and leaning towards a sweetness that hides the hop content somewhat. There was a slight dryness in the finish but not really a lot going on in the mouth. Refreshing and thirst quenching but a little too much like a pilsner/lager for me. Obviously well made and different to most cask beers, glad I’ve had one: my first beer from this brewery.

Bright gold with a moderate, smooth snow-white head that solidly films the glass as the liquid disappears....the strong Pilsner-esque grassy Saaz character is dominent, but the rye adds a nice light extra spiciness and a hint of berries in the fine aroma....on the tongue, a beautiful balance between the spicy, bready rye, the tingly dry grassy-mineralic hop bitterness and beautifully extracted, very full, lightly sweet pale malts....a long, dry bitter finish never thins out and the strong grainy chacter is dominant throughout....this is really quite lovely, the best lager I’ve had at the Pub in quite some time, and the first new beer I can remember having seconds of on a first visit since....heck if I know.

Lizard Frenchmans Creek;Helston, Cornwall, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Lizard Ales;One of the worse ales I have ever tried.

Burton Old Cottage Oak Ale;Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Burton Old Cottage;Handpull cask at the Old Cottage Tavern, Burton. Amber with a creamy light tan head. Very little aroma. Almost none. Which is partly due to the (too cold) conditioning. There’s a bit of naked malt but that’s it. Sweet taste with a toffee and stone fruit note. Bitterness creeps up at the end of the sip for a lingering dry finish. Pretty good but not exciting by any stretch.

(i can’t imagine this being better with more bubbles anyway)
Nimbus Alt;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Nimbus Brewing Company;Hand bottle shared by bockyhorsey. Full amber colored pour, though the head was a bit weak (a little flat, Bill said it was a tad flat the first time he had it too, so probably not strictly a feature of the hand bottle). The aroma was caramel, faint chocolate, some nuts. Flavor was caramel malts, some roasty choco faint notes, nuts too, followed by a bitter mildly hopped finished. A little on the sticky side, flavors didn’t do wonders for me, mouthfeel being on the flat side of things didn’t help either. However, as w/ all altbiers, I always have a good time trying a new one out. Thanks, Bill!
Nimbus Alt;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Nimbus Brewing Company;Tap @ Brewery. A fruity aroma on the nose. Darker amber body with off white head. Beside the fruit flavors a licorice flavor was present as well. Some mild bitterness and the fruity flavor lingered on the palate.
Nimbus Alt;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Nimbus Brewing Company;On tap @ Nimbus - Pours a clear deep amber color with a small off white head. Left some nice lacing behind as I drank the beer. Aroma is a toasty caramel malt and very light esters. The flavor is much of the same. Has a slightly bitter astringent aftertaste. A good beer.
Nimbus Alt;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Nimbus Brewing Company;"Sampled July 2007 at Nimbus Sits in my pint glass with a clear, amber-red color. It is topped by a light tan colored layer of thin froth. The aroma is made up of fruit (with berry being most noticeable, toasty malt notes, biscuit aromatics and some light caramel. The berry aromatics seem to be a mix of hop, yeast and malt contributions. The beer feels creamy up front, but then a light carbonations adds some texture towards the middle. This tastes of herbal hops, fruit (again berry notes, but also some melon flavors), and some substantial malt notes are here as well; notes of light caramel, biscuit, and perhaps some toffee flavors are all noticeable. This finishes with a nice bitterness that provides an astringent bite that makes one want to take another sip of this brew. This is a nice mix berry, herbal and malt flavors. This is actually quite a decent, even actually good, example of an Alt. It does not have that hoppy vibrant character of my favorite versions, but I really like the chewy, creamy mouthfeel; the beer just slides down my throat with a smooth, interesting texture."

Tastes roasty and toasty, with strong caramel notes and some grassy hops. Fairly balanced. A solid beer and a pretty good schwarzbier.

Orlio Organic Black Lager;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);Pours a barely transparent black mahogany with a thin, spotty-lacing light tan head. Aroma of semi-dry toasty grainy black malts with a touch of dark chocolate and coffee. Body starts with an earthy grainy dark caramel and roasted maltiness with some stale dark fruity notes and a touch of licorice toward the bittersweet finish.

Orlio Organic Black Lager;South Burlington, Vermont, United States;Schwarzbier / Black Lager;Magic Hat Brewing Company (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);this is good stuff. it is quite flavorful and has the immediete hit of acrid acid charcoal and chocolate in expresso coffee. the brew has a refreshing palate and body and is carbonated moderately which suited this brew perfectly. touch of spice pepper and anise i enjoyed this beer very much and reccommend it! just a touch of sweetness nice!

Shaws New Dawn;Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Shaws Brewery;Cask Handpump at the Bhurtpore Inn, Aston 29/07/2007 Fruity floral aroma. Clear golden coloured hoppy and floral with a crisp and bitter dry malt finish.
York Nugget;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask. A golden beer with a thick off-white head. The aroma is primarily hoppy and citrusy, but also with a light malty note, and so is the flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth, but at the same time very sparkling for a cask ale.
York Nugget;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);on cask at a wetherspoons in glasgow. golden, white head that didn’t get a chance to last or not. very citric aroma - lemon rind, lime. hint of musk and a citric bitter finish
York Nugget;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);A very fresh offering of clearish golden hue covered by a small white head. Kinda sugary malt base supports the strongly aromatic, very citrusy, lemony hop scents. This translates into a rather bright palate with full-on citrus, little acidity and comfortable bitterness. Light and easy drinking yet packing lots of taste.
York Nugget;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask handpull at Westgate Spoons, Canterbury. Gold, lasting beige head. Citrusy, grapefruit, nutty, slightly herby beer. Decent sherbert finish. Interesting beer, plenty of flavour. Hops and walmuts. Good, my kind of golden bitter. Good bitterness on finish.
York Nugget;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Blackfriers. Beautiful pour. Aroma is citrus up front, lots of bittering hop, grassy an just full of hop. Taste is similar dry and bittering, very very sessionable indeed, peppery hops pluck the mouth slightly.
York Nugget;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask @ Moon Under Water in Watford. Pours a light golden colour with some white, rocky head. Aroma of fruit sweets and hops. The taste is quite sweet with stewed fruit at the for and some slightly bitter hops on the aftertaste. Quite drinkable.
York Nugget;York, North Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask at The Yorkshire Terrier, York. Pours a beautiful clear golden-orange with a large lasting creamy white head. Nice aroma of resin and citrus hops along with some fruit. Flavour of citrusy hops and light spices -- quite flavourful. Medium bodied. Really enjoyable and a nice departure from the many English beers I’ve tried on this trip, it’s pleasantly hoppier.

Havran Desítka 10°;Uherský Brod, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Minipivovar Balkán;"Deep golden body with some bubbles, white head, some laces; Big nose with bitter malt aromas and pleasantly green earthy hop aromas, a bit simple; Strange body, it seems like it has a big carbonation but at the same time it seems flat and dead, buttery soft texture and only little bitterness; Quite long finish, again only slightly bitter but plenty of aroma, toasted malt, toasted bread, texture and carbonation seems again a bit dead, some hop aromas are freshing it up a little. Parts of this beer is quite good others are really not."
Havran Kvasnicové Pivo 12°;Uherský Brod, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Minipivovar Balkán;"Hay golden hazy body, fluffy white head, lacing; Very balanced nose with all elements apparent though only very little of each; Soft body with soft carbonation, quite fresh but not bitter enough; A bit short finish again balanced but it doesnt show much, very pleasant balanced aromas in finish.

Marienstatter Klosterbräu;Streithausen-Marienstatt, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Marienstatter Brauhaus;Bottle, thanks Roman. 4.8& ABV, about month over BB. Pours dark brown with beige head. The heads stays. Aroma and flavor are sweet, malty, grainy. Touch of metallic notes also in the flavor. Body is bit thin. Finnish has some bitterness. Overall: good, I'm sucker for these kind of malty beers.
Marienstatter Klosterbräu;Streithausen-Marienstatt, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Marienstatter Brauhaus;Bottle. Pours clear amber. Aroma is caramel, old dry bread. Body is light, somehow softly burnt, silken carbonation, toasted malts, but actually more watery than malty. Palate is non-existent. Boring.
Marienstatter Klosterbräu;Streithausen-Marienstatt, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Marienstatter Brauhaus;500ml bottle thanks to Kolschtrinker. Pours deep hazed brown, frothy off white topping. Aroma is fairly light, soft brown bread. Taste is similarly light, some nutty brown bread, smooth malt, caramel. Its a passable dunkel, too light and thin for some but i found it sessionable enough.

Marienstatter Klosterbräu;Streithausen-Marienstatt, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Marienstatter Brauhaus;50cl bottle bb05/15, rare sanctified offering in idiosynkrasie’s bountiful tradebox, marcielujah! Luminous, clear copper-red beer, rustic cap. Diluted spiced Malzbonbon for a nose, honey-drenched bread rolls and other bakery mainstays. Taking a first sip coats all areas on the tongue in an unmerciful spicy astringency, seemingly coming from both malt-aromatics in husky, chestnut peel, and aggressive hops in grass-husk overdrive. Like licking toasted bread and then dipping the tip of your tongue in stale marmite. Forbidding in this sense, watery after that. Sourish-edged cowfodder finish. Very conflicted and borderline impalatable amidst the best of intentions: this Hail Mary, alas, is no Mother of Mercy.
Marienstatter Klosterbräu;Streithausen-Marienstatt, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Marienstatter Brauhaus;Copper color with small head and nice lace.

Marienstatter Klosterbräu;Streithausen-Marienstatt, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Marienstatter Brauhaus;"Die Abtei Marienstatt braut das Bier selber, hat aber anscheinend keine Abfüllanlage, weshalb auf der Flasche nur steht: ""Abgefüllt für..."", wahrscheinlich von der naheliegenden Hohenfelder Brauerei. Leicht hefiger, getreidig-malziger Geruch. Feinherber Antrunk mit minimal würziger Note, etwas später setzt ein zuerst verwässertes Malzaroma ein, das sich später stabilisiert. Im Mittelteil aber hat das Bier einen Durchhänger, die untertönige Würze ist auf einmal der alleinige Geschmecksträger, schafft es aber nicht, dass Bier harmonisch zu gestalten.Im nachgeschmack setzt die Herbe erneut ein, diesmal ist der malzige Teil etwas röstmalzig und nicht verwässert.

Stein Konzumné Pivo Svetlé 8%;Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovar Steiger;Bottle from Terno. Aroma lightstruck, grainy, maybe some light actual maltiness beneath all that. Clear golden colour, reasonably sized white head, rather poor retention. Taste is simple, mostly malty, with only light bitterness and hops flavour. Thankfully devoid of any significant flaws. Thin bodied but what is to expect at 8°P? Quite okay one.

Stein Konzumné Pivo Svetlé 8%;Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovar Steiger;From 500ml bottle at tasting on 6 May 2012. I had this noted down simply as Bratislavky Stein 3.6% but I guess I was just being lazy and this is the one. Clear gold. Thin white head. Lively carbonation. Rather grainy aroma. Soft and not too dirty on the palate. Not much hop presence. Inoffensive if underwhelming.
Stein Konzumné Pivo Svetlé 8%;Vyhne, Slovakia;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pivovar Steiger;Bottle at a ChrisO tasting - London. I think I got this from Cuso? Pours perfectly clear yellow with a frothy, white foam head. Classic doughy cereal aroma, some light hay, too. Medium sweet flavor, heavily doughy, some straw, light metal, light grass. Light bodied with fine to average carbonation. Sweet finish, lightly sugary, very doughy. A bit sweet and perhaps too doughy, but not altogether bad.

Free State Eccentricity (2007 Release);Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Free State Brewing Company;Tap @ FS, pours a darker than expected cloudy amber color with a nice off-white head that persists, great lacing. Aroma of light oak, bourbon/whiskey, orange peel and light spice. Flavor has good belgian wheat qualities, but with subtle overtones of the barrel-aging coming along nicely. Overall, this is a very well balanced and complimentary BA beer, not overdone or heavyhanded. Looking forward to trying again with the local cherry juice blend, and seeing what the other Eccentricity BA series surprises will be! Thanks for spicing up the summer Free State! 9/4/8/4/17=4.2
Christian Drouin Cidre Brut;Coudray-Rabut, France;Apple Cider;Christian Drouin;75cl glasses, merci Miles. - Refreshing light cider with a near-Gutedel sweet fruitiness and enough dryness to keep it light and dry. A cider that despite its summery fruit quality, with some blossom and more refined Grauburgunder tartness going on at the edges, manages a subtle complexity.
Christian Drouin Cidre Brut;Coudray-Rabut, France;Apple Cider;Christian Drouin;Bright, deep gold color, thin layer of bubbles. Nose like sweet, floral, crisp ripe yellow delicious. Tingles like champagne with a mild sweetness and moderately dry finish. Nice tannins, like chewing on Muscat grape and appleseed. Pleasant and refreshing.
Christian Drouin Cidre Brut;Coudray-Rabut, France;Apple Cider;Christian Drouin;This is 5,5%. It’s warm golden with an OK head. The aroma has notes of barnyard, cellar, apples and yeast. The flavour has sweetness, notes of apple, candy sugar, damp basement, barnyard, earthy fruit and it ends on a dry and sweet note with barnyard and cellar. A bit odd.
Christian Drouin Cidre Brut;Coudray-Rabut, France;Apple Cider;Christian Drouin;2006 corked and caged bottle. Label said 5.5 % Pours clear deep golden. No head. Decaying apples and sweaty horses on the nose. Very sparkling on the tongue. Flavour is sweet and somewhat tart juicy winter apples.

Otro Mundo Nut Brown Ale;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Brown Ale;Otro Mundo Brewing Company (CCU);Really excited when I found this and it's Golden brother in a Deli near my daughters place in Laguna Hills, California: I shouldn't have been! At least this was better than the Golden Ale. The pint and 9oz bottle poured a hazy cola brown, the head just scummy wisp. Malty and nutty nose, semi-sweet and nasty flavour. Drank on 29th March 2019. Never been to Argentina, the beers I have tried from there are not enticing me to change that.
Lafrance Le Petit Villageois;Saint-Joseph-du-lac, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Domaine Lafrance - Les Vergers Lafrance;Bottle. Pours a clear gold at first, picking up the faintest haze as the bit of yeast at the bottom mixes in. Lightly vinous, soft apples, sweet apple candy – but not cloying. Very soft, dry apple contrasted with a light sweetness, big effervescence but comprised of tiny delicate bubbles, champagne yeast notes as well. Dry warming finish with warmed apple notes on the finish.

Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;Sampled at the brewpub. Deep amber color with an offwhite head. Spicy and malty aromas. Good bitterness and balance with spice, malt and caramel flavors.
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;(On draught at Sun Up). Pours a clear deep amber with a thin light tan head. Aroma has citrus, pine and resin. Taste is sweetish with bitterness. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Biter finish. Decent, easy-drinking beer.
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;This was poured up via cask along with Amarillo dry hopping at the brewpub. It has a copper – brown body and firm tan head. The aroma is kind of soft but gives you a nice load of spicy hops and earthy hops as well as a background of sweet malts. The taste has a very pleasing mix of spicy hops and citrus hop flavor that roll quickly into resiny hop bitteriness. Beneath the hops are malts and some caramel like malts too. Dig it.
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;Draft at the brewpub. Nice bronzed red color with a standing head. Delivers a sharp bite up front but settles into a mellow maltiness. Good. (#4087, from notes Jan 2011)
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;"On tap; poured a copper/red color with an off white head. Aroma of caramel, red malt, toasted malt, fruit, spice/earth, and a dash of pine. Flavor was quite enjoyable. Caramel, pine, earth; primarily."
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Amber red color with a sticky head. Lots of roasty caramel malt and a nice dose of grapefruity hops. A fantastic amber!
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;On tap at The Den. Pours a dark shade of amber with a trim off-white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. Smells predominantly of grapefruity hops. Tastes of dry hops, caramel, mild citrus, and biscuity malt. Not bad.
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;On cask at Papago. Pours a clear reddish brown with a one finger creamy off-white head that leaves nice lacing. The nose is caramel, citrus and pine. The taste is grassy hops, light grain, caramel malt, light resin and some tart citrus in the finish. Medium creamy mouthfeel due to the cask. Really good Amber.
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;On cask and dry hopped @ Sun Up. Pours a nice copper with a bubbly white head. Aroma was fresh hops, caramel, grass, pine, malt. Flavor is fresh hops, caramel, malt. Light bodied but very flavorful. It’s not fair to even compare the dry hopped cask offering to the regular but this was very enjoyable.
Sun Up Armadillo Red Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Sun Up Brewery;On tap @ the brewery. Crimson colored brew with a 1/2 inch eggshell head that left a decent amount of lacing. Caramel malt, abundant hops, and a little nuttiness. Medium mouthfeel...highly drinkable with ample carbonation. Decent.
Brewers Den Uwes Oulde Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Old Ale;Sun Up Brewery;Reviewed 9/5/2009 (Draft @ SunUp Brewpub, Phoenix, AZ): Pours an ink black body. No head. A roasted chocolate aroma, and strong alcohol. Not very strong overall aroma. Chocolately taste, a little roasted. Not alcoholy. Mostly smooth. Some alcohol bite as it warms more. Not too bad, wish it had some better flavors. Girlfriend really loved this beer.
Brewers Den Uwes Oulde Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Old Ale;Sun Up Brewery;Pretty damn good beer!!! Dark brown-leather pour with an extremely small latte head that left sticky cobwebs of lacing on the inside of the glass. Aroma is of maple syrup, cocoa, roasted coffee, and vanilla. Flavor has notes of caramel, molasses, chocolate, and smoke. Slippery mouthfeel. Barely recognizable alcohol...impressive.
Brewers Den Uwes Oulde Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Old Ale;Sun Up Brewery;On tap at Sun Up, or the artist formerly known as Brewer’s Den. Pours a roasted black color with a creamy oatmeal head. Smells of black licorice and malt. Tastes hearty - layered with dark cocoa, further licorice, faint smoke, and chalk. Would definitely drink this again.
Brewers Den Uwes Oulde Ale;Phoenix, Arizona, United States;Old Ale;Sun Up Brewery;Tap @ Brewhouse. A cold coffee aroma. Black body with thin tan head with some lacing. Good sweet licorice candy flavor with some bitterness. Smooth easy to drink brew hard to believe it had a 9% alcohol content. Found the alcohol kick on the last swig and then I was a believer.
York Glory;York, North Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;York Brewery (Black Sheep);Cask at Aikmans Cellar Bar, St Andrews. The 4.2% was scrawled on in pen, so I’m assuming this was the ABV. Clears slowly to a golden-straw coloured beer with a thin bubbly white head. Hoppy with some yeast. Some hoppy citrus and some grassiness. Very grassy hop with a touch of caramel biscuit malt. Quite harsh and rough on the palate. Bit bogstandard, really.
Fujiyama Weizen;Fujiyoshida, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fujiyama Beer;Eh this was a mediocre hefeweizen......I only bought it because of the distinctive one liter can. Sweet aromas of bananas, cream and bubblegum. Faitly bland flavors of wheat and banana. Moderately creamy body.
Fujiyama Weizen;Fujiyoshida, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fujiyama Beer;Tap at the brewhouse. Light golden color, tall fine head. Slightly cloudy. Huge carbonation. “Kristal Klar” type. Slightly rancid aroma with wheat malt, banana, cloves, and butter -- too much butter. Light body, lightish flavor, clean and crisp with good wheat malt, fruit, banana, and spice. Best of the lot, despite the slightly odd aroma.
Fujiyama Weizen;Fujiyoshida, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fujiyama Beer;My Bottom Line: Tropical fruit esters yield personality to this quirky, full-bodied Hefeweizen, whereas bready yeast and hay-like malts whip up sustenance. Sadly, this was the only Fujiyama beer which didn’t show any brewing problems. Further Personal Perceptions: -A lemon wedge was served on a side dish, thankfully. -Glass was frozen, yet the veil of foam remained atop the cloudy beige straw. -The odd but pleasant fruit mix is reminiscent of a fruit salad yoghurt. -Raw and flavorful, this was their best by far that day. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Fujiyama Helles;Fujiyoshida, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Fujiyama Beer;Seasonal beer, on tap ar the brewery. Very light gold, head turned to lace after five minutes. Sweet aroma of rancid butter. Strange flavor of medicinal herbs, steel, light fruit. Not very beer-like at all. Hoppy, bitter finish that is very metallic. Tastes unfinished, unripe, and quite probably spoiled. I normally wouldn’t include this rating at all, thinking the beer a mistake, but since Martin T had a similar experience a year before me, obviously this is how they intend to make this crap.
Fujiyama Helles;Fujiyoshida, Japan;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Fujiyama Beer;"My Bottom Line: A dirty blanket found in the attic should not be representative of a Helles, ever. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the clear blond, producing some lacing. -This dusty, dead yeastiness pervades the flavor profile. -Body is lean, offering a few honeyed cereals. -There is barely any hop flavor, although some wooden hop bitterness is felt. -Light citrusy fruitiness is found underneath the dustiness. -Rubbing alcohol and chlorine are soon found in the nose; dis-gus-ting. -This botched batch should not have been served. On tap at the brewery restaurant."
Great Lakes Brewery Project X;Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada;Brown Ale;Great Lakes Brewery (Ontario);Bottle - 650ml. Hazy amber body with a thin white foamy head. Good malty/hoppy aroma with fruity hints. Its fair taste is slightly dominated by hoppy flavors. It carries fruity and yeasty notes. Ends with a decent bittersweet finish.
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;From Brennans. Yellowish pour white head. Aroma has sweet fruits. Some citrus. Taste similar. Shrug, not bad.12.3
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;355ml bottle. Hazed brown/gold pour. Fizzy head that quickly disispates. Smell is sour lemon and sweet malt. Flavor is lemon, herbs, malt, caramel. It certainly is more beerlike than a mikes hard but I don’t know if I would take this over that when looking for alcoholic soda.
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;This is the best adult lemonade I’ve had outside of some really good Radlers in Germany. This is sweet, but still has some lager-esque beer taste to it unlike Summer Shandy which just tastes like sugar. It’s still very sugary, but how are you going to get to Lemonade without sugar? A lot of review seem to be holding that against this, but other than pouring a bottle of lager and a bottle of lemonade together you aren’t going to end up with something better in this sub-category. It’s way more drinkable than the malt liquor lemonade drinks like Mikes. This is my favorite beer in the summer now. Absolutely perfect on a summer Saturday afternoon.
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Bottle - Clear golden with a ring of off-white head. Nose is lemon, pear, and a whole bunch of cane sugar. Whoa daddy is this sweet. Taste is...damn. Balls. It’s sweet, but for me it’s not cloying. It’s got some lemon acidity that cuts it a bit, and a hint of honey, light yeastiness, and grainy malt in the background. Finishes a bit tart, with lemonade coming through a bit more. Overcarbonated, slick and thin. Yes, this sucker is REALLY sweet, but the Mountain Dew-swilling 10-year-old in me really likes it, too. This’d be a guilty pleasure for me if I allowed those. (I’m a douche)
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Dark yellow. Basically no head. Aroma is lemonade - lemon and sugar. Same flavor, some beer character in the finish. Crisp and refreshing. Sweet. Mild tartness. Surprisingly big body.
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Has a nice lemon scent with a light cloudy golden color. Has a very sweet taste, refreshing for camping. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;I’m a rookie in this beer rating but here it goes. Found this putting together a pic a six didn’t realize it was a beer. Not your traditional beer. Aroma is somewhat strong defiantly lemon. Appearance: Color is a cloudy pale yellow with a small white head that does not linger. Taste is of a strong but sweet lemonade and the finish has sort of a zing it. Palate: Medium bodied, sticky texture and a somewhat fizzy carbonation. The finish is has a abrupt bite to it. This has very little taste of traditional beer taste but overall a pleasant surprise. Think it would be better enjoyed in the summer rather then the winter.
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;This beer is really pretty decent, but still nothing much to it. I like some more complexity.
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;Poured a pale, cloudy light gold with a quickly fading head and lace. Aroma was of sweet lemonade with twingle of fruity malt. Taste was sweet lemonade initially and then slipped into a slight malt flavor with tangy finish. Hops seemed minimally present. Palate was average. Overall, I thought this was the lemonade equivalent of something similar to New Glarus Belgium Red (cherry). Very easy drinking and refreshing in the summer.
Sand Creek Hard Lemonade;Black River Falls, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Sand Creek Brewing Company;It poured a light brownish color with a small white head. The aroma was very sweet lemon citrus. The taste was very lemony, like very sweet sugary alcoholic candy.

Brewster's Lilith;Grantham, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Brewster's Brewery (UK);Clear dark golden. Rather flat looking ale without any head. Pretty leafy up front, floral, clearly intended to be hop oriented. Aromatic, but upon sipping, a gentle honeyed maltiness gets revealed. Not too grainy for a change and bearing a nice and confident bitterness.

Beer Works Mysterian (Brett version);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beer Works;Pours deep yellow as a typical belgian. Musty aroma with the Brett on the forefront. You get more spices within the mouthfeel. The fruit flavors push towards the finish.
Beer Works Mysterian (Brett version);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beer Works;[draught @ Canal Street, 7/31/07] Earthy hop aroma, with the slightest hint of brett funk. Pours a luminous golden yellow color with an ample white head. Earthy, somewhat spicy hop character provides the foundation for some major brett funk as well as some pear and apple flavors towards the finish. Very dry and funky brett finish works well.
Beer Works Mysterian (Brett version);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beer Works;Tap@Beer Works. A pleasant Belgian style pale. This was quite dry, with some nice lightly earthy hop flavours and some soft bitterness. Lightly yeasty characters as well. Quite hazy/cloudy. Quite drinkable.
Beer Works Mysterian (Brett version);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beer Works;Many, many draught tulips at Fenway locale on 7/31/07 Neat, small, white head is well-retained, especially for this brewpub, which usually has some retention/lacing problems. Body is a moderately hazy, golden delicious apple yellow, with strong gold tints. Lovely lilac and wildflower hoppiness in the nose peppered by light phenols and some pear skin and other esters. Pronounced, but yet soft and elegant. Medium high strength of aroma. Spicy golding hops are very fresh and flavorful, peppering the palate with vivid allusions to Orval. The brett slowly inserts itself towards the finish, following a very clean, moderately sweet pale maltiness and adds a strong layer of tartness that really helps clear the palate on the end. Pear skins, limes, honey, wildflowers and white pepper phenols all swirl about as the luscious liquid sits on the palate. For a draught beer, the carbonation is fairly engaging, though the bubbles are a bit too large and it does create a little bit of looseness/flabbiness. Malts feel about on par with an aged Orval, having a touch of paperiness to them, but otherwise still retaining the balancing sweetness. Very, very hoppy, but never bitter hoppy. Tons of brett and with a vivid lilac telltale Orval signature that only Goldings and Brett mixed together can provide. Not Orval, but damn near close. I didnt find the base beer, when I had it last about 3 years ago, to be as riveting, but that could be a lot of things, and indeed I can only judge what I’m tasting here. Though with that in mind, and having only had this one batch, I probably am not giving it as high a rating as it deserves, as I still wonder about the consistency of producing this beer. There’s a big difference between producing a highly successful Orval clone and producing Orval year-after-year (which certainly has its consistency problems as well). Draught again, Canal St location with Duff on 8/31/07 Unfortunately, either the keg was all churned up, or we got the bottom of it. Unsettled, very muddy pour and all of the yeast and other sediment dulled the aroma and caused dirty notes in the flavor. Still pretty damned good, but no where near what it was fresh and much less muddy when I had it at Fenway. I’ll still keep my rating from that one, but if I rated this sample, it would be more like a 7/3/7/4/13
Beer Works Mysterian (Brett version);Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Beer Works;Tap @ Salem Beer Works. Pours a golden amber with a small white head. Aroma is overwhelming hop with slight fruit, yeast, and citrus notes. Taste is the hoppy explosion you expect from a dry-hopped ale, though the finish was slightly watery. Overall a great brew.

Bierlaboratorium Tierkreiselixier Krebs;Munich, Bavaria, Germany;Flavored - Other;Giesinger Bräu;Sehr prickelnder Antrunk, etwas nach Anis, insgesamt mild.

Cloudy yellow, champagne-sparkling carbonation, huge stable off-white head. Bready base, banana a bit clove - the star-anis complements all this very well and a fresh spritzer Elderberry of gives it the last fresh aroma in the back of the mouth which really rounds the wheat beer off. Medium body, sparkly mouthfeel. Excellent combination of spices, a big thumbs up to the bold brewers of Bierlaboratorium for brewing this in the heart of ""Reinheitsgebot""-land. I am looking forward to try the other Tierkreiselexier spice combinations."

Berry fruits in the aroma, and a predominantly caramel flavour, but with some subtle herbal notes. Medium bodied slick mouth feel.

Opaque gold in colour with a thin white head. Very slight hint of lychee fruit in the brief aroma. Thin mouthfeel and good lacing. Pale malt base gives a robust golden syrup flavour with sweet juicy lychees and honeydew melon. No tart citric fruit notes evident in this. Slight note of bitter hops gives a dusty dry aftertaste.

Becken Weizen;Miyoshi-shi, Hiroshima-ken, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Miyoshi Becken Beer;My Bottom Line: The union of banana esters, spicy hops and bready yeast in this Hefeweizen is wisely served through a soft mouthfeel that ensures the highest quaffability. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the cloudy apple juice yellow. -The soft prickling of carbonation doesn’t bother the balanced flavor profile. -All flavors play equal in this Weizen, even in the finish.

Honeyrun Cherry Honeywine;Chico, California, United States;Mead;Honeyrun Winery & Honey Company;Appears nicely, love the bottle, some may say that they don’t enjoy the smell, but to me it’s just honeyish alcohol. It flows well, brings a nice buzz (like all others) So, what Im getting at , just enjoy, nice favors thrown in. All all in I enjoyed, I’m not much of a wine drinker, prefer heavies or liquor, but this wine was sort of a delicacy. The price is veeery reasonable. It is good.

Honeyrun Cherry Honeywine;Chico, California, United States;Mead;Honeyrun Winery & Honey Company;Deep red colo, almost fake looking. Aroma is sweet honey and slight cherry, flavor is more cherry juice than honey. This isn’t as heavy as empire mead and a lot heavier than redstone, so basically I tihnk it’s perfectly balanced in the middle. Plus, when mixed with champagne, it’s even better. Bottle from Total Wine and More.

Taisetsu Kurodake;Asahikawa, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;On tap at BeerFes Osaka 2019. Light overripe stone fruit nose, with a medley of moderate dark fruit as well. Dark copper/brown color, completely flat. Dark fruit, mild flavors, then it get treacly sweet. Medium body. No real character to this one.
Taisetsu Kurodake;Asahikawa, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Tap at the Koumin Ramen Event as Taisetsu Kuratake Doppelbock 8% A reddish plum caramel color with a wispy beige head and stone fruit. Bready and dry with a touch of heat, plums and caramel but a balancing bitterness too. Much nicer than the last beer I tried from these guys.
Taisetsu Kurodake;Asahikawa, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Tap at Baku. This was labeled a bock there. Nutty nose, chocolate and caramel. Dark brown with lace. Sweet flavor of burnt caramel, brown sugar, chocolate. A bit thin in body. Ok.
Taisetsu Kurodake;Asahikawa, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;This was just too sweet for me. Had quite a lot going on...maybe too much. Colour was nice...smell was great--hell, even the first 5 sips were great. I was right in the middle of thinking this one’s a real winner ands then it hit me---whew--this may be tough brew to finish. If served as a half pint, it would all be well and good. But as a full pint...simply too much.
Taisetsu Kurodake;Asahikawa, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Wasn’t too impressed with this, but came at the end of the night so I might need to look at it again. I’ve seen it described as a Strong Ale and a Bock. I felt it more like a stout-bock hybrid. Very malty and heavy. Very straight forward with little else going on. Too bad
Taisetsu Kurodake;Asahikawa, Japan;Strong Ale - English;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;"My Bottom Line: Plentiful blackberries burst within the creamy roastiness of a Stout, creating a united flavor profile which leads to coffee bean and leafy hop bitterness. Taisetsu’s crowning achievement this Strong Ale, yet it is not one that will enter the masterpiece pantheon. Further Personal Perceptions: -The sheet of foam sticks to the glass, protecting the darkest purplish-burgundy. -Caramel maltiness works well with the dark fruitiness. -I’m not sure they were really trying to emulate a specific style here; it’s a bit like the maltiness of a Stout or Porter meeting the fruitiness of an Old Ale. -Some alcohol heat is felt in the back. -The nose is not as developed as the flavor profile. On tap at the brewery restaurant."
Matthews Bristol Champion;Bristol, Gloucestershire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Dawkins Ales;Cask-conditioned at the Hillgrove Porter Stores, Bristol 1/8/07. Copper-gold colour with a decent off-white head. The aroma was of redcurrants and spicy hops, perhaps closest to mace. A hint of toffee flavour was followed by a grapefruit hop finish. Brewed to celebrate the Hillgrove’s win as Bristol CAMRA pub of the year 2007, this was very good.
Taisetsu Yusuzumi;Asahikawa, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;My Bottom Line: This watery lager does harbor a few pale fruit flavors for the flavor seeker, but there is barely any grain to be found, and of course hops are absent. Beer-flavored water? No, thanks. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam sinks into the very pale, clear golden. -The low prickliness and lacking maltiness are bound to disappoint those looking for an active and/or chewy mouthfeel. -Oh, it’s clean, no doubt about that. Just not flavorful. At all. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Taisetsu Bihaku;Asahikawa, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;Drunk on draft at Thrash Zone Yokohama. Nice tasting weizen. Was there on my last night of my trip to Japan. The taste of the beer is not sweet a little bitter, but still fruity
Taisetsu Bihaku;Asahikawa, Japan;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Taisetsu Ji-Beer;My Bottom Line: The doughy yeast and welcoming banana esters of this well-structured Weizen are bound to satisfy the thirsty, fruit-loving beer drinker, but might bore the connoisseurs after a few gulps. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam covers the hazy blond. -Crackers are evoked by the crisp maltiness. -A milky character is found within the yeast signature. -The body is lean and almost creamy, lending enough bulk for the subtle flavor profile to express itself. On tap at the brewery restaurant.
Kirin Meiji-Era Lager;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);"Can (notes from tasting session). This was from a set of period ""recreations"" of earlier Kirin lager styles. It had more body than the Taisho-era lager. Very rounded, "" softer, and less bitter, too. A bit more fruit malt but less aroma. Not bad."

Kirin Meiji-Era Lager;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);2008 version. Surprisingly aroma, lighter malt, citrus and pine. Rather light malt, cereals, bittering hops, Bitter finish with little malt flavor. Very light yellow color. Rather thin in malt. Decently bitter, but not much flavor at all. Better than their regular beers but too thin. 7/2/6/2/10 2011 version had very nice, fresh, green hops, with citrus, grass, juicy and tasty. A big surprise.
Kirin Meiji-Era Lager;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);Yellowish golden. Crystal clear. Medium-sized fine-laced white head. Distinct sharp hop aroma. Slight metallic. Strong hop flavours with a citrus-like edge. Notes rubber. Surprisingly malty. Medium-bodied. Harsh hop bitterness. Feels a little off as there are some sherry-like flavours.

Light harmonic malty fruity aroma with rubbery notes. Dry dense straw and malt aroma with powerful medicinal hoppy background. Dry medicinal hoppy aftertaste. Clean, clear mouthfeel. Quite interesting, and not at all bad. (0.35l can from a grocery store in Tokyo.)
Kirin Meiji-Era Lager;Tokyo, Japan;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Kirin Brewery Company (Kirin Holdings);My Bottom Line: This eminently drinkable lager benefits from a firm wooden hop presence and crisp (although thin) maltiness to sway the macro drinker into downing something slightly different from what he’s used to. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam surrounds the pale blond. -Lemony fruitiness tags along the mild cereal sweetness. -The overall flavor profile is balanced. -Pleasant carbonation cannot conceal the lack of maltiness. Can. Thx, Tim!
Cottrell Rainmaker Amber Ale;Pawcatuck, Connecticut, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Cottrell Brewing Company;Pretty good ale. I had this on tap at Foxwoods Casino and am amazed that this is in here. It just goes to show that ratebeer.com is the best!! Has a bit of a hoppy flavor to it, similar to a Sam Adams.

Hartford Better Beer Co. Praying Mantis Porter;Stafford Springs, Connecticut, United States;Porter;The Hartford Better Beer Company;A blackish brown body with a tan head that had great retention and nice lace only downside was it seemed a bit thin looking which did carry through to the mouth feel. Aroma was if roasted malts and some coffee malts. Subtle chocolate and a bit of ash. Flavor seemed to be mostly roasted malts. A good flavor but not much else going on. There were enough chocolate and smoke flavors to keep it from being one dimensional. Smooth finish. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Caledonian Rebus 20;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Tasted this at the James Watt, Greenock (JDW) in August 2007. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper red in colour with a thin white creamy head. Distinctive Caley toffee aroma. Thin mouthfeel with good lacing. Pale malts give a maltloaf base with sweet winegum fruit notes and a spicy coriander flavour in the mouth. Woody redcurrant fruit adds dryness to the short bitter resins in the aftertaste. Finish is spicy with mulled wine notes and a herbal quality. An interesting ale and fairly decent as a new brew.
Caledonian Rebus 20;Edinburgh, Scotland;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Caledonian Brewery (Heineken UK);Cask at the Guildford Arms, Edinburgh (August, 2007). Dark amber color. Sweet, strong, aroma with honey, spices, and…ginger. Sweet flavor of honey and fruit, with ginger (added for sure). Good enough, but not well balanced. Too sweet and spicy, with too much ginger.

Malty nose with very spicy, bitter-sweet notes of something (sweet gale would be my guess). Malty, spicy taste with an earthy , spicy, bitter-sweet finish. Interesting and very spicy beer.

Keswick Thirst Fall;Keswick, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Keswick Brewing Co.;Bottle from the Lakes. A style that has almost seemed to have died out in recent trends. The beer pours a dark Seville Orange Marmalade colour. Lightly carbonated, the beer smells of dark berries and chocolate. This fruit/chocolate theme continues on the first taste. The balance is good, and body lighter than you might think. It tastes juicy and summery on one hand, but warming and autumnal on the other. Nice and, now, just a little bit old fashioned.
Keswick Thirst Fall;Keswick, Cumbria, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Keswick Brewing Co.;On gravity at Bristol beef festival, 16/3/2013. Amber with a slight, off-white head.

Le Trou du Diable Baron Noir;Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Le Trou du Diable (Six Pints - Molson Coors);On draft at Dominion Wine and Beer. Pours black with a tan head. Aromas of leather and cocoa. Flavors are moderately sweet. Okay.
Le Trou du Diable Baron Noir;Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada;Porter - Baltic;Le Trou du Diable (Six Pints - Molson Coors);Bought at Liquor Shed. No dating. It pours pitch black with a great head of foam and lacing. Looks are top notch. Smells of molasses, caramel, chocolate, roasted malt. The taste has all of that but doesn't seem very vibrant compared to the smell. Kinda blah. Good enough mouthfeel. One and done, I reckon.
Elevator Three Frogs IPA;Columbus, Ohio, United States;IPA;Elevator Brewing Company;Well over carbonated. Hard to contain the foam from this beer to be able to take a drink. The taste is a little aggressive and ling ers on the pallet as too heavy. It's not a bad beer overall, but it's lost to adentify it's self. I would not buy beer his again. I did like the carton artist design. This brewery is better than this beer.

Elevator Three Frogs IPA;Columbus, Ohio, United States;IPA;Elevator Brewing Company;"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/9/2017. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy golden orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus rind/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance. Slight lingering hop astringency near the end of the glass, but not overwhelming. Moderate dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation, increasing through the glass. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately sticky/resinous/rindy, and fairly creamy/bready/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is good. Zero warming alcohol for 6.9%. Overall this is a nice IPA. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink; despite the bitter/drying finish and higher carbonation. Good hop vibrancy and nice solid malt backing, with minimal residual sweetness. A nicely enjoyable offering."

Bear Republic Crystal Wit;Healdsburg, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;On tap at Rattle’N’Hum - Manhattan, NY. Soft wheat ale aroma. Flavors are very very light. I dig super-light session styles, but this tastes like a straight up Cinncinnati-style cream ale. Fresh and with a quick and wonderful twang of hops in the finish. I went back for more of this, because the hoppiness really builds in a great way past the finish. I love that this doesn’t have the unfortunate spice marring that most witbiers have.
Bear Republic Crystal Wit;Healdsburg, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;(Old BA rate - tap) Slightly hazy light straw yellow. Nice pure white head. Lemony and yeasty aromas, very delicate, but still nice. True to style, citruisy and yeasty flavors, but was nearing on a German-style wheat at some points during the sample. Lightly carbonated, and would expected a bit more body. This was an pretty drinkable brew, but it was lacking a bit in complexity. Overall, I wanted a bit more of a ’snap’ in flavor and complexity. However, this was still a solid brew

Bear Republic Crystal Wit;Healdsburg, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Bear Republic Brewing Company;The menu had this listed as just Wit Beer.

Not the classic wheat, it was smooth and subtly spiced without the over the top sweetness or cloying yeast presence. Unfiltered and served in a tall pilsner glass with a lemon wedge. Some citrus, but not much.
Winters Geniuss;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Stout;Winters Brewery;Gravity poured pint at the 2013 CAMRA AGM in Norwich on 20 Apr. An off-white foaming head sat on top of this good looking dark brew, deep ruby red when held to a light source, otherwise a very dark brown colour. Dark fruits and malty molasses blend together nicely to give this beer a pleasant aroma and taste. Not the heaviest bodied stout about, but this was fine and suited the flavours and alcohol level just right: a well make and tasty brew.

Taste comprises bready malts, hint of melon, straw, faint citric essence, grassy. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, semi drying close.

Chalk Hill Gold;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Chalk Hill Brewery;Cask (Coach & Horses, Norwich) (6:3:6-:3:11=2.9-) A simple and unsatisfying pale bitter, in essense. Sweetish, both aroma and taste. Watery palate. Soft palate, carbonation low. A bit of a palate cleanser during the chilli nachos, which let me enjoy the CHB Tap much more. Too watery and too boring.

Coastal Angelina;Crewe, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Coastal Brewery;500ml bottle conditioned: BBD Jul 2017. The first beer of a Virtual Bar session on 28th Oct 2016. The bottle had been in my chilling fridge for two days, but it still gushed out on opening. The ’Old Speckled Hen’ vase shaped pint glass couldn’t cope but in the end I had a clear, rich golden bodied beer with a ’Mr Softy’ like towering white head on top. Malty front with a semi-bitter hoppy, dry finish. Mild citrus notes throughout, but nothing overpowering or heavy. Beer grew on me, bit ’homebrew’ initially in my thoughts, but once into it my view changed. Peppery undertones somewhere in the flavour: beer ends up ’decent’.

Climax Hoffmann Hefeweizen;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Climax Brewing Company;"Situation: a lazy hazy Thursday in June... Glassware: Konig-Pilsener weizen... Appearance: orange-lemon gold tint with thick, effervescent haze appropriate to a hefe...unfortunately, straight out the growler, the head flattened to a thin sudsy line, suggesting a lack of freshness or a lack of strength... Aroma: as expected, banana dominates with a hint of bready cereal--inviting to a degree... Palate: quite thin and sharply crisp, active on the tongue and the throat; busier and with more body than I had anticipated... Taste: the label says ""distinct""--and the tartness in this beer is surprisingly strong for a hefe... intensity mellows with every sip, and the malt is a fortifying element... Overall: Trying to stay local, I buy a growler or two a year from Climax, and I hadn’t tried the hefe yet (must have been a recent add, considering the dearth of reviews). I like their take on the style, and though few will confuse this with a German variety, it cuts the humidity on this night as I hoped it would when I bought it a few days ago. Yeasty with a malt backbone, this works for me..."
Climax Hoffmann Hefeweizen;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Climax Brewing Company;Draft at CAH. Pours hazu bubbly dull gold with white head. Nose is hopcitrus, malt, slight vegetal. Tastes of hopcit, malt, slight spice, and a bit of an off flavor.
Climax Hoffmann Hefeweizen;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Climax Brewing Company;Growler. Golden in color, very little evidence of carbonation. Somewhat watery on the tongue -- light mouthfeel. Lots of caramel, but fairly one-dimensional. Drinkable, but too flat to evince much flavor or interest to the palate.
Climax Hoffmann Hefeweizen;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Climax Brewing Company;Growler. Pours a golden white body with a foamy white head. Fruity wheat character, coriander, lemon grass, hints of spice and clove. Banana and bubblegum with a sweeter finish. Decent.
Climax Hoffmann Hefeweizen;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Climax Brewing Company;growler-pours a foamy to rocky white head and cloudy yellow color. Aroma is banana, musty wheat, some fruit-lemon and clove. Taste is musty wheat, some fruit-lemon and clove, banana. All the right ingredients, the taste just doesn’t come together for me. Not undrinkable, but one is enough. Fair amount of similarity to the cream ale and a home brewish character. Thanks to JWC215 for sharing.
Climax Hoffmann Hefeweizen;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Climax Brewing Company;"Not my cup of tea. Banana tartness ruled this beer. This beer is missing the distinctive clove character of a hefe (this was planned by Dave Hoffman; no mistake) which makes for an interesting take, but also one I found I could not get my head around. Pours a cloudy maize with an ample white head."
Piltri Porter Robust;El Bolson, Argentina;Porter;Piltri;A heavy, potent smell and taste. Strong chocolate and bitter coffee. One of the best beers I had in Bolson, and in the craft market on a Thursday when I was there. Would highly recommend - a good product. On tap from the brewers stall.
Piltri Porter Robust;El Bolson, Argentina;Porter;Piltri;"Appearance: dark brown with reddish tones. Medium head, of beige color, but few persistent. Aroma: sweet toasty malty, chocolate and coffee tones. Fruitiness of dark olives, berries and peaches. Spicy, like clove, nutmeg and aniseed. Not hoppy. Flavor: intensive toasty. Sourness out of style beer. Grain coffee and handcrafted bitter chocolate. Fruitiness of berries, figs, dark olives and dry-sour grapefruits. Sweet-toasty start, acid progress; and dry-toasty final. Very low hoppy. Reminiscences of vanilla, aniseed, clove and ginger. Liquory, like Fernet and vintage wine. Palate: light body for a porter, watery texture. Medium carbonation, something artificial. Nice beer, very drinkable, relatively complex, with fresh toasty; but very light body for the style and sourness some excessive."
75th Street Ex Desparatus Belgian Style Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the brewery. Served a bit warmer that I would have liked, which enhanced some flavor, but decreased the nice palate I think it would have had. Nose was a nice belgian yeast - I was getting somewhere between banana, bubblegum, and cotton candy as the glass went down. Taste was nice and malty with a good spice to it and a lovely hoppiness. I’d have this one again.
75th Street Ex Desparatus Belgian Style Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;75th Street Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear, pale gold with an inch thick, dirty white colored, creamy head that dissipates slowly and leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is a mix of Belgian yeast and herbal hops, but more caramel malts jump out than anything else. Some light banana and citrus. Flavor is initially a slippery and watery caramel maltiness. The middle is a light Belgian fruitiness before a growing bitterness kicks in. Stays moderately bitter and herbal with a light pine in the finish. Some of that Belgian yeast and banana remain in the lingering flavor as well. Palate is light to medium bodied and dry. Overall, a decent beer. Not the best balance, but enough flavor to enjoy.

75th Street Ex Desparatus Belgian Style Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;75th Street Brewery;Sample at GABF 2007. Light amber in color with a medium white head. Seems light in body. Some mild orange flavors, but uninspiring. Finish is unusually dry.
75th Street Ex Desparatus Belgian Style Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;75th Street Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Malty, spicy and citric aroma, grainy, bready, doughy, peppery and lightly fruity, perhaps some faint mustiness. Clear medium copper color with a large-bubbled, lasting head and sheets of lace. Flavor profile is also lightly sweet and fruity, caramel and malt grains, blended with tangy fruits, spice, lemon and spicy, peppery, green hops, these mostly towards the finish. Hints of honey late. Mouthfeel is creamy, effervescent and smooth, body is medium. An interesting experiment for this brewer, seems more like something I’d expect from New Belgium.
75th Street Ex Desparatus Belgian Style Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;75th Street Brewery;"GABF 2007. Not impressive. Clear yellow in the glass. Strong smell of yeast and diacytl; not appetizing at all. Mealy in the mouth, very grain forward in the sweetness and flavor (reminding me of a maibock). Corriander is faint in the weak finish."
75th Street Ex Desparatus Belgian Style Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;75th Street Brewery;On draft at the brewpub. Pours a clear copper, with a creamy off-white head. On the nose, I picked up coriander, caramel and yeasty banana. Medium-bodied and slick it finishes lightly bitter and dry. The flavor is toasty caramel malt, citrus, and Belgian yeast (including a faint banana/cloviness) followed by a light hop kick. It finishes mildly bitter and dry leaving you with yeasty banana after-burps. A nice beer.
75th Street Ex Desparatus Belgian Style Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;75th Street Brewery;I had another pint of this the other day. A much better beer now. I got lots of Belgian yeast character to go with some aggressive hops. A strong bitter finish. Lots of carbonation. On draft at the brewpub Dark copper, almost brown, with a white head. Light corriander and orange aromas. Some toasted malt character. Dish soap like aroma. Toasted malt flavor with some citrus. A touch of bitterness. I get the metallic aftertaste the Tim mentioned. Medium body. I had 2 pints. Don’t know if I’d have another.
75th Street Ex Desparatus Belgian Style Pale Ale;Kansas City, Missouri, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;75th Street Brewery;16 oz draft at the Brew Pub. Pour is a very clear orange yellow with a smallish off white head. Aroma is coriander, orange, spice and malt. Taste starts with the orange citrus and coriander, then moves to a nice grainy (malt / wheat) middle and finishes with some tart bitterness. There is something a bit off in the aftertaste, almost metallic. Despite this, a nice beer.
Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;Bottled. Poured a lovely shade of deep brown with a creamy, sticky beige head.. looked great in the glass! The aroma picked up heavy doses of coffee and baker’s chocolate, with complementary lactose and rolled oat accents.. touches of earth too.. really good stuff. The flavor held up really well too.. sweet rolled oats, milky, and darker chocolates at the core.. cocoa and light herbal bitterness around.. dry, roasty finish with lactic sourness.. very tasty! Medium-bodied and super dry on the palate.. higher carbonation.. quite a bit of roast.. didn’t flow perfectly, but it was a really great brew overall.
Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;12oz bottle, black label. Dark brown pour. no head. Rich molasses aroma.

Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;"Bottle thanks to Adam. Pours a black hue with a medium beige head. A sweet coffee and roast nose. A nice flavor; smooth roasted malts, ash, light fruit. Slightly thin."
Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;A big thanks to Santa Adam for sending this my way. The bottle poured into a pint glass produced a finger worth of tan head that sat on top of a black bodied brew. I got a lot of roasted goodness coming from the nose typical chocolate and coffee notes filled my head. Flavor wise it mimics the nose but with a good balance of sweetness and roasted bitter making it rather drinkable. The mouthfeel was medium with good carbonation. I easily drank the bottle I had and could have had a few more. I was pleasantly surprised with this brewery and would be proud to call it my local brewer. Serving type: bottle
Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;Went out of my way to get this, found it in Walmart at the 3 springs exit off 22, airport area. Says stout ale on the front, heheh. If you want a couple more styles of Mntnr, go to the nearby Krogers. Yes, I know the one in Wheeling diddn’t have it but this one does. Pours a big black opaque stout without much head, if any. Smell is friendly, outdorzy and fresh next too the extinguished campfire like really early in the morning at sunrise. No gunk on the bottom but this may be due to the slight agitation gettintg it home. Initial smooth nearly tart effect on the taste buds. Sizzly but sliightly below average CO2., but nice for this style. Roasted burnt flavors of chewing on some old washed out slightly burned campfire wood. Gentle and pretty good for a dry stout. Is it perhaps because its offstyle that I find it atttractive? Goes down pretty easy and is even rising to the level of fun at times. Overall good beer experience without a terrible bitter linger on the finish. Pale Lager lovers may find this appealing. I’ll have to try another bottle of this nifty local brew. Glad I went N got it. OK, did another bottle, its not a fluke! Not watery.
Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;Bottle - thanks hopscotch. Pours a deep brown color with a short lived brown head. Very still, looks like cola without bubbles. Smells roasty, but sweet. Has a little coffee grounds thing going on and a just a little chocolate. Has a prickly roasty body with lots of carbonation. The roast presence is good, along with a light amount of bittersweet cocoa (baker’s choc?) and faint coffee. Fits into the bill for a dry stout.
Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;(Old BA rate - bottle) Poured with a thin tannish head that dissipated pretty quickly. Almost completely black color, but had hints of ruby and brown. Nice roasted malt aromas, with some malty sweetness followed by bittersweet chocolate. Really bitter (not hop bitter) overall, and not nearly as roasty as suggested in the aroma. The taste hints at some elements I would associate with the style, but doesn’t get close enough. Pretty thin MF, closing in on a little too thin. Carbonation is pretty high given the style. Drinkability is pretty low given the lack of stand out flavors, and the bubbliness of the carbonation. Didn’t really demand another sip. Overall, this is isn’t the best example of the style that I’ve had, but not the worst brew ever. The brew looked and smelled great, but the rest of the elements just weren’t there.
Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;12 ounce bottle from Beer Run in Charlottesville, VA. Pours a dark inky brown color with a medium sized fizzy frothy brown head. Fairly poor head retention and fair lacing. Aroma is rich roasted malts and coffee, along with a faint bit of chocolate and smoke. The taste is coffee, smoke, roasted malts and a chocolate finish. Creamy texture, but a bit thin, and firmly carbonated. One of the better offerings from these guys, and an enjoyable brew.
Mountaineer Stout;Martinsburg, West Virginia, United States;Stout - Dry;Mountaineer Brewing Co.;On tap @ Cheat River Inn-Elkins WVA-poured black w/o much head. Roasted malt/coffee aroma.

Stewart's Bourbon Doppelbock;Bear, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Stewart's Brewing Company;Draft @ Stewarts. Dark brown color with a reddish tint. Aroma is sweet and malty with bourbon and wood, fresh bread, and some light fruit. Flavor is a smooth and sweet mix of bourbon, wood, and sweet malt. Stings the tongue a bit. Less bourbony than the BA Barleywine. Tasty!

Brasserie des Cieux Stout des Bois;Cormagens, Switzerland;Stout;Cieux;Bottled, thanks Bov! Transparently black, creamy beige head. Aroma of tart raspberries with salty licorice underneath. Dryish and light bodied were tobacco and licorice meets fresh raspberreis. The missing link between a softer Irish stout and a frambozenlambik. A dangerously wild idea, but who dares wins.
Brasserie des Cieux Stout des Bois;Cormagens, Switzerland;Stout;Cieux;Bottled. Black with brown edges. Low but firm beige head. Intruiging and funny aroma of mildly acidic fresh wild raspberries with notes of almonds. Subtle notes of roasted malts. Roasted malts and nougat in the flavour but is quickly overshadowed by acidic wild raspberries. Fresh raspberries and almond in the refreshing finish. Now, this was a funny and quite uniqe beer. Thank to Per for this one.

Thunder Canyon Tumbling Plumbleweed;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;[Tap] Pours a hazy shade of light pink. Sweet and fruity nose includes berries and lighter grainy notes. The taste is sweet, but also tart. Raspberry and rhubarb are the two flavors coming forward the most. Decent mouthfeel for the style. Mild, sweet finish. Actually not too bad.

Thunder Canyon Tumbling Plumbleweed;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;very light, clear amber with a pinkish tint. thin white head. aroma is bready, slightly metallic with dark fruit (...plum, as you could guess...). flavor is pruny, dark fruit, malty-bready quality. sweet, malty, almost saccharine finish.
Thunder Canyon Tumbling Plumbleweed;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;pours mostly orange gold but it does have a slight pink hue to it. the head is pretty much just a lasting white ring. it smells mostly of honey (or at least that tc house smell of honey) with notes of caramel/maltiness, flowers, slight spice and some tart fruit which i can assume is plums. the palate is fairly sweet but it seems to work by adding a bit of richness... flavors of honey (honey this time. not just house flavor!), actual plum meat and not the skins and a slightly spicy finish. sweet for sure but it is balanced well enough to make it enjoyable from some fruity tartness. the body is medium. mouth feel is a bit sticky and slick but bitey from spice and carbonation. it’s a bit one dimensional but i’m sure peeps love this one! 6/3/6/3.5/13/3.2
Thunder Canyon Tumbling Plumbleweed;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Pours a pinkish color with a very small light pink head. Tastes like most of their other fruit beers. Fruity and sweet. Drinkable, but not overly impressed. Notes from last summer.
Thunder Canyon Tumbling Plumbleweed;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;Tap @ Brewery. Definently get plumbs on the nose. Pinkish body color with white head. Besides the sweet plum this one also had a decent blckberry flavor as well. Carbination and not as tart as some fruit beers can be. Dryness on the palate could of been either from the three beers or chicken wings take your pick. Bg gulp of water for the road.
Thunder Canyon Tumbling Plumbleweed;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;On tap @ brewery - Pours a hazy purplish-amber color with a small light pink head. Aroma is very light fruit (plum I guess). Flavor is sweet light plum with little else. Medium body. A typical TC fruit beer. Not bad.
Thunder Canyon Tumbling Plumbleweed;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Thunder Canyon Brewery;This beer is quite hazy with a light purple, almost pink color to it. It is topped by a touch of purple tinged froth. The aroma is lightly tart smelling with a quite apparent fruitiness to it that is a mix of plum, cherry and berry notes. This is quite sweet, which really accentuates some solid berry flavors, but not really any distinctly plum flavors. This is in fact very sweet, though I would not characterize it as being cloying, but it is certainly a bit too much for my personal tastes. This, like most of the fruit beers here, is very one dimensional. It is certainly an easy drinking beer, even enjoyable at times and I have a feeling that those who like really fruity beers will really enjoy this.

Just so you know, I am not hating on Seven Bridges. And if my ratings on the Einbock and Belgian Spiced ale don’t confirm so, then I shall try again. Pours a dark soy-sauce, cola. Decent coca head. Nose is coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and burnt malts. Taste has the same with additional hints of roasted nuts. Overall this is a decent brew and a good stout. It could use with a thicker consistency."
Seven Bridges Espresso Stout;Jacksonville, Florida, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Seven Bridges Grille & Brewery (Craftworks);Pint on cask at the Seven Bridges Brewpub in Jacksonville FL. Black and thick looking pour. Beautiful creamy tan head that lasts a long time. Aroma is dark malt, chocolate and coffee. Flavor has a good initial rush of dark roasted coffee, carried by a substantial sweet dark malt backbone and layers of chocolate. Very tasty and well made. I see an espresso stout listed at Big River Grille, but I don’t think this was the same because everybody was complaining about that one being so thin, and this one was definitely not thin.
Bios Hop & Mout Export;Ertvelde, Belgium;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brouwerij Van Steenberge;One of three ’Bios Hop & Mout’ beers Van Steenberge keeps in honour locally for the sake of tradition. This one is an ’export’ in the old Flemish sense of the word, meaning a lager bottled in 33 cl instead of 25 cl, a tradition usually only remembered by old chaps with caps. Snow white, sticky, thinnish but stable foam, colour of ’old gold’, clear and nicely sparkling. Sweetish malt aroma, bit honeyish, with chamomille-like floral hops and hints of cookies, iron, cloves, young cheese and even a very subtle smokiness. Neutral onset with medium carbonation, vague malt sweetness, finishing shortly hop bitterish. Unpretentious, very old-fashioned lager and definitely not the same beer as their Sparta Pils.

Nice opaque appearance with a lasting beige head. It’s a weird one. One sip I like it, the next I’m not so sure.

Thunder Canyon Roadrunner Red Lager;Tucson, Arizona, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Thunder Canyon Brewery;This beer is brilliantly clear and is almost brown in color, it certainly is not really red. It is topped by a small, wispy, tan colored head. The aroma is quite malty, with notes of toasty grain, biscuit-like notes, some hints of chocolate even, perhaps some hints of fruit as well as some herbal hop aromatics. The taste is lightly sweet and has a hint of raisin and some other fruit-like notes to it. There is a fair amount of malt character here, but not as much as the aroma would have suggested. Some balancing herbal hop character is noticeable and there is a distinct bitterness in the finish that is there just enough to provide a crispness. This has a pretty nice malt profile, but I really wish that the flavor had lived up to the aromatic promises.

Northwoods Ripplin Red Raspberry Ale;Osseo, Wisconsin, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Northwoods Brew Pub;I think the brewery changed the name of this beer, but it’s still a raspberry wheat ale. My pint arrived with a small head and was highlighted by a strange, pinkish hue.The first notes are sour followed by a watery raspberry flavor.

Muskie Capital Nut Brown Ale;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Muskie Capital Brewery;On tap. Pours a cloudy chestnut-brown with a tightly packed head that seems unusual for an English brown (and the commercial description gives fair warning of a more “American” degree of carbonation). Aroma is nutty and strangely alcoholic. Flavor is muted but shows some fruity esters, lightly toasted grain, a nice dose of clean malt and a moderate hop bitterness. Medium-bodied and a rather lively palate for the style, again owing to the “American” level of carbonation. A subtle and well-balanced beer, and a pretty good representative of the style. Nice.

Muskie Capital Pale Ale;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Muskie Capital Brewery;Growler shared by Skyview. This is a very good apa.

Very full bodied. Sweet malt base. Cloudy orange.
Muskie Capital Pale Ale;Hayward, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Muskie Capital Brewery;Available on draught at the Hayward Eatery brewpub in Hayward, Wisconsin. Pours a hazy orange amber brew with an off white head that quickly dissolves to an off-white ring with good lacing. Aroma of mostly sweet grapefruit, some caramel malt and more citrus zest. Taste is light carbonation, medium bodied with a pronounced sweet grapefruit and pine flavor that overpowers any malt flavors. Finish has a sweet grapefruit that leaves behind a lingering mild bitter aftertaste. This brew is more into the IPA character than an American Pale Ale, but with out the high alcohol. Bartender informed me that this pale ale is a different product from their American Pale Ale. If you are doing a sampler flight at the brewpub and this Pale Ale is on the menu, do this one last. This will temporarily short out your taste palate.

Fort Street Senne-Sation Lambic;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Fort Street Brewery;MGBF 07. Murky, pale body with a small, white head. The aroma is some funk, light horse, cheese, lactic acid, lemon and very grainy malts. The flavor is lightly sour, watery, grainy, slight oxidized with some lactic acids. Medium/light body is thin and watery with light carbonation. I applaud the effort, but the results just weren’t there.
Fort Street Senne-Sation Lambic;Lincoln Park, Michigan, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Fort Street Brewery;On tap: The aroma has a realy funky grassy (like day old grass clippings) sourness with a hint of spice. Its a cloudy dull orangish-yellow with a small soapy white head. The flavor has moderate lemony sourness up front. The finish had strong notes of the day old grass clippings with some faint apple and cinnamon in the finish. Very strange.

West Bamberger;Glasgow, Scotland;Smoked - Rauchbier;West Brewing Co.;on tap at the brewpub. amber, no head, only the faintest hint of smoke in the aroma, some banana sweetness, slightly metallic, seems a bit over-processed as with the other west beers
West Bamberger;Glasgow, Scotland;Smoked - Rauchbier;West Brewing Co.;Clear headless amber body. Light woody, leathery nose offering dried apricot flavours. Surprisingly well assembled, but ugly to look at. Limited sweetness fits the low hop levels. Soft smoky finish. Sharp and pointy. Hard carbonation feels aggressive. Not very smoky, but balanced in an odd way. It would be hugely bland without the, albeit light, smokiness, but as it is, it feels like one of the best brews I’ve had at West.

West Bamberger;Glasgow, Scotland;Smoked - Rauchbier;West Brewing Co.;Tap, brewpub, RBESG 07. Mucky brown, huge white head that fades. Nose is hoppy, some hazy wheat. Mouth is a bit smoky hop, but nothing really notable. Wheaty. Finishes smoky and slightly sour. Alright, but nothing to write home about.

West Bamberger;Glasgow, Scotland;Smoked - Rauchbier;West Brewing Co.;A Mes rate: Tap at the Brewpub. Dirty brown with no head.

A little watery in the palate.

Bavaria Swinckels;Lieshout, Netherlands;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Bavaria Brouwerij (Swinkels Family Brewers);Oct 2013. 330ml dark bottle, filtered, from BeerWulf. A typical smudgy lager with a mild hop bite that could be noble hops or a small amount of Cascade, or a blend. But the hops are not enough to lift this anyway. I like my lagers to be either more interesting or more refreshing. Give me crisp and fresh rather than the dreary creamy sludge that this is.

Clear pale yellow colour with an enormous fluffy head, foamy, all over the place. Slightly malty and hoppy, with a resiny touch.

Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Velvet Pale Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;"Enjoyed at the brewpub in a large mug. The beer pours a relatively hazy orange color, with a substantial white head. Cascade/Amarillo and Simcoe hops to the nose; quite pleasing. The palate is initially relatively bitter, but not overly so for an APA. Citrus flavors, along with the beautiful note of danky/catyness that I so often long for. Malt flavors come in the mid-palate to provide a sweetness that falls just short of complete balance with the aforementioned bitterness. The finish is fairly clean and leaves some residual hop flavor on the palate. Overall, one of the best Rock Bottom beers I’ve sample."
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Velvet Pale Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;Sampled on nitro draft at the brewery this beer poured an orange color with a medium sized creamy beige head. The aroma was citrus, grapefruit and light pine. The flavor was grapefruit with a touch of pine and lemon. There was a sour and tangy middle and a long tart grapefruity finish. Smooth and fairly full bodied. Decent.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Velvet Pale Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;On tap at the Pittsburgh Rock Bottom with nitrogen propulsion. A little too bitter initially. Medium hoppy beginning impact. Hoppish APA flavors. Virtually flat with no carbonation except perhaps a tingle. Beatiful rolling pour from the tap as with any nitro beer. Settles to an orangish color. Fruity aroma clean and fresh olfactory.
Rock Bottom Pittsburgh Velvet Pale Ale;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rock Bottom Pittsburgh;This draft brew from the Oregon Brewers festival poured a small sized head of frothy medium sized bubbles that were fully diminished and left behind a transparent uncarbonated light orange brown colored body. The mild aroma was hoppy and malty. The mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish. The thin flavor contained notes of malt. A horrible one that I would not buy again. Off the mark. Pass on this one.

Anacapa Belgian Wit;Ventura, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Anacapa Brewing Company;On tap at Mammoth Bluesapalooza 2008. Pours a golden, slightly hazy hue with a very nice yeasty banana/clove nose. Taste was an awesome combination of sweet banana and citrusy goodness. The corinander kicked in at the finish and matched nicely with the yeast pop, finished with just a tad of tartness. This one left a very distinct memory and I dug it, alot. Thanks for the pour Adam, nice brew!!!!

Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;"Bottled is better than tap, at least I tried both and that’s my opinion. Great flavor and aroma. Unluckly, it’s almost impossible to find it now, because isn’t anymore at the ""brewmaster selection"" of Antares. Will wait for the next time!"
Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;Bottle @ Chris_o. Pours a clear golden color with a small off-white head. Spicy malty and slightly yeasty aroma. Sweet malty malty spicy flavor with some hints of yeast and also some herbal hints. Warming spicy yeasty finish. A little thin though.
Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;Tap at brewpub on December 12, 2007. A light yellow color with a diminished white head. A spiced and herbal flavors but rather light or thin. Dry and semi-sweet candy elements.
Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;Bottled 750cl. A golden yellow beer with a white head. Aroma is fruity with notes of herbs. Taste is fruity and spicy. Very belgian. Nice mouthfeel a high carbonation
Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;Bottle at Chris_o’s Magic Night. Pale gold, still yeasty, bit of spice. Bit thin I thought. It’s a tripel. Bit thin. OK.
Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;A Mes rate: 75cl bottle at the Magic_dave6 shindig at Chris O’s. Blonde with a slim white head. Herbacious with tropical fruits, aniseed and orange plus some nice hoppage. Straight forward but really tasty. Although the alcohol is quite clear in the finish I can’t help but feel it’s a little whimpish and needs a bit of bite. Nice though.
Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;Bottle at chris_o’s. What a beer we have here, possibly the best triple iv ever had. Alround: Citrus, floural, candy sugar, spicey orange and cloves, grassy, vry very tasty, the only beer i went back and had second and thirds of.
Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;75cl bottle at Bohemia bar, BsAs - This actually tasted Belgian... or, at least, it had the characteristic spiciness you often find in Belgian tripels so full marks for using the (presumably) correct yeast. A sweetish amber beer, it had a decent malty taste - if a little lacking complexity amd candy sugar as a proper tripel - then more spiciness in the dry, malty finish. A good attempt from 7,000 miles away!
Antares Tripel;Mar del Plata - P. de Bs As, Argentina;Tripel;Antares;Tap at Antares Palermo, August 07. Cristal clear, golden color with a creamy, medium white head and an effervescent carbonatation. Fruity aroma, some pears and mineral notes. Tastes fruity, esthery, spicy, very duvelesque. Gentle but firm with a nice, comforting spicy aftertaste. Medium palate, filling, inviting, vivid with a spicy crispiness. Nice, well crafted, engaging tripel.
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Grabbed a bottle while walking dogs, it’s easier to get sake ticks than beer if I plan on drinking at home in my neighborhood. Pours a murky pale greenish. Nose is odd rice and sour citrus. Tastes of pears, lychee, lime soda, rice, and simple syrup. Sweet but not cloying. Overall just odd and not all that pleasant.
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Labeled as Trader Joe-san’s Sparkling Sake - Tallahassee, Fl - Trader Joe’s - 300 ml bottle. Pours a slightly hazy pale light golden, slight bubble action. Aroma has some light pineapple accents,a brief floral hint - pleasant. Flavor has some pineapple-like fruitiness, a touch of mango, some boiled rice in the back ground. Crisp, smooth mouthfeel. Very easy drinking saké.
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Bottled. Poured like club soda with a quickly-fizzling white head and rising carbonation. The aroma picked up honeysuckle, pine needles, and sweeter rice.. touches of pepper around.. I really have no basis for comparison, but I enjoyed it. The flavor found honey, honeysuckle, and sweet rice at the core, with apple skins and peppery esters around.. picked up some odd, dank character along with overripe apple and a kiss of alcohol warmth on the finish. Lighter-bodied and fizzy on the palate.. transitions were alright.. more weird stuff came through as it warmed up.
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Trader Joe-san’s Sparkling Sake: Pours a milky-clear, somewhat like coconut water. Thin, soda-like receding head. Fruity pineapple like aroma. A bit of alcohol seems to be coming off as well. Strange sensation. Really tastes like a fruit soda with a thicker texture and a starchy finish. That pineapple fruit flavor is all over the place. Light apple cider up front, and then becomes this thick and almost chalky. Has that weird finish that I don’t like so much that I might have a name for if I were a little more versed on sake. I like it
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Trader Joe-San’s bottle. Pours looking like a sparkling lemonade, the sake has a little bit of a head at first which is interesting and nothing I’ve ever seen before. The aroma is sweet and very floral, light hints of alcohol & mild fruitiness. The taste is fairly sweet and loaded with nice pear notes. There is a light tartness here and some light alcohol. All together it’s pretty sweet, but it’s very nice tasting... a tad drier and I’d love it.
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Trader Joe’s label on this one. Pours a fizzy clear white. Aroma is weak... some faint booziness is about it. Flavor is very sweet up front... a nice blast of pear and table sugar. Alcohol and fizz take over down the home stretch. Interesting, but not my thing.
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Bottle as Trader Joe-San’s Sparkling Sake. This was unbearable. Aroma is a tape-like, ethyl acetate and wet cardboard aroma. Pours a murky, clouded rice water. Flavors are unbearably sweet, tainted with some ridiculous pale fruit flavoring, and the meager carbonation just makes this feel uneven and sickly. Would never buy again.
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;I had both the Ume No Yado and the Trader Joe’s Sparkling Sake side by side when tasting. Both poured a faint yellow with a small bubble white head that faded down pretty quickly. The TJ’s version was a tad bit darker yellow than what poured out of the Ume No Yado bottle. The UNY nose had a pretty sweet nose with notes of peach and pineapple. The TJs had a stronger peach presence than the UNY nose had. Flavor of the UMY was fairly sweet with a light note of peach and tropical fruity flavors but mostly was composed of flavors from the rice. TJs had a bit more tropical fruity sweetness with the rice flavors a bit more subdued. Body was light with lots of carbonation. I really did enjoy the sake’s. The nose was much strong in both than the flavors but it was very well balanced in the sake. Trader Joe’s is supposed to be the same thing but there are subtle differences in the flavors, none of which would necessitate paying $3-5 more for the UNY.
Ume No Yado Tsukiusagi (Moon Rabbit) Sparkling Saké;Katsuragi-City Nara, Japan;Saké - Infused;Ume No Yado Brewery;Bottle 330ml. blue bottle @ post De Molen we want to goto bed Sake Tasting.

Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at brewpub pre DLD ... light amber ... slighty hazy ... some pine hop in niose... bright hoppy with a little banana,.
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at GI. Golden pour. Typical white head. Lemon, wheat and some faint bubble gum. Flavor is malty and some bitter lemon. Not so great here. I thought it would have been better. Not enough body.
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Goose – Clybourn. Poured clear pale golden with a short cap of white head. The aroma was quite fragrant and lemony with a soft wheat malt backing.. liked it quite a bit. The flavor found sweet pale and almost whiskey-y maltage at the core with sour oaky and wheaty accents around.. somewhat tasty. Tangy on the palate with the wheat and lemon responsible.. the malts became tacky, which threw off the flow. OK.
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. Rating #10... I seem to have a lot of those. Pours a slightly hazy clear yellow/golden with a small white frothy head 3.5. Lovely amarillo hop aroma that is somewhat reminiscent of Crack’d Wheat, sweet and citrusy. Nice up front amarillo hop taste which fades a bit too quickly into some lighter watery gritty wheat with a touch of banana, bubble-gum and citrus. Light bodied with larger sizzling carbonation.
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Imperial pint poured draft at the brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a very nice light golden hue, luminescent, with medium haze, and big white cakey head that sits atop and laces well. Aromas are citrusy lemon, light florals dance with light sweetness and a small wheaty graininess. My style. Initial is light bodied, largely pushing lemon zest and juice, light bitterness that comes fuller towards the back of the palate. Mellow sweetness with good bitterness. A light brew that packs some pleasant flavors. Finish leaves lemon, slight gumball, and flaked wheat flavors. A bit of a tartness remains, light dough. Good, very sessionable. Cheers!
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Cask at Goose Island Clybourn brewpub - named Midwest Coast Wheat. The only beer tonight that isn’t clear. Hazy medium gold. Aroma is on the weak side. Flavour is decent. Medium hoppiness is noticeable upfront. Not particularly wheaty. More like an IPA, though far more restrained than their own IPA.
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Tap at GI Clybourn. Pour is hazy copper with diminished head. Taste is very bready sweet with a caramelized aspect to it. Distincly hoppy nose, but overall the wheat comes through the most. Obvious Centennial nose and taste, but finished malty. Nice, but maybe needs some work.
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);Pour is lightly hazed golden yellow with a thin white head...smell is lightly toasty and faintly spicy...taste is faintly sweet and toasty at first with some grapefruity hoppiness coming out in the finish...interesting take on a wheat beer...
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at the GI Clybourn location. This was called Midwest Coast wheat, though. The body was hazy dep orange and gold with a slightly off white head. The aroma was orange peels with some light bananas. I also got some carrot cake. The taste was mild bread crust with some orange peels. Nice and drinkable, while they say it’s hoppy, I didn’t think so.
Goose Island Midwest Coast Wheat;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Wheat Ale;Goose Island Beer Company - Brewpubs (AB-Inbev);On tap at Clybourn. Pours a cloudy blond color. Not a lot of hop aroma, and not a lot of hops in the flavor as well. Refreshing though, a not a bad summer wheat.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle at home. Pours lightly hazy ruby with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with spotty lacing. Aroma is heavy fresh raspberries, medium cereal and meal malt. Flavor is lightly sweet raspberries, medium cereal and meal malt, light citrus hops and bitterness with a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;12oz bottle shared with my wife on 25th May 2016: poured into a Corsendonk tulip. Clear light pink/raspberry red body, wispy white head. A bit too ’Raspberry’ for my liking, the wife however quite enjoyed her half of the bottle. Label says Raspberry Ale, so keep away if you don’t want to smell and taste a Raspberry flavoured beer.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;once again...tastes fake. kit made, but not as utterly offensive as many of their beers. too light and one dimensional to be considered average, but at least i can finish a bottle.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a dark pink-red color with a trace white head that faded and left no lacing. The aroma was vague artificial berry. The flavor was tartish and semi sweet with cardboard, cracker and faint vague artificial berry. Medium finish. Light body. Blah.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;12 oz. bottle from brokensail- thanks again for this turd! Pours a clear rose-tinted gold with a small off-white head. Aroma of raspberry- sugary raspberry candy, more like it. Not too bad. But the flavor is just...absent. There’s nothing. Minerals, a hint of raspberry candy...and nothing else. Light-bodied, with a smooth, mineral mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. So weird. Nothing here.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle from Total Wine in Sacramento, CA. Pours orange with a slight white head. Aroma is firmly raspberry, but for some reason reminds me of mosquito repellent. Not much body, and not a whole lot of flavor. There’s malt and light raspberry. Not harmful, but far from exciting. Had worse. Pretty sure about that.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;12oz bottle pours clear copper with tiny off white head. The aroma is big sugary cotton candy like berry fruitiness and the flavor is no different but rather in taste form. I don’t get any “beer” notes . . . can’t finish it either.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;12 oz. bottle from Total Wine - Pours a clear pinkish-amber color with a half finger thick off white head. Faint lacing. Aroma is rasperries. Very candy like. Flavor is light raspberries. Kinda medicinal. Light body. Not too bad.
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;"Bottle; not expecting much from this very bad brewery. Poured a slighlty pink amber with a light pink/off white head. Aroma of raspberry, must and sugar. Flavor was much worse. Strange and watery. Palate was a mess and the after taste the worse part. Have one more of their beers in the fridge, but not buying any more. Bad"
Indian Wells Raspberry Ale;Inyokern, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Indian Wells Brewing;Pours a super ugly light pink piss water, no head... Aroma is generic candy strawberries, doesn’t smell terrible... The taste is terrible though, reminds me of a flat sparkling water, a bad strawberry taste, really bad
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;This poured a pale yellow color with a normal white head. Aroma was a bit grassy and sweet. Flavor was sweet but watery with hints of musty and grassy hops. Not good.
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;"Hazy golden orange with a white head. Perfume, brett, lavender and spices in the nose; interesting. Flavor has notes of lemon, wheat, flowers, spice, brett/funk, slightly tart and sour. Very crisp and attenuated. Medium bodied with effervescent, lively carbonation. Interesting beer, perhaps a slightly funky, accidental saison?"
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Thanks to Ken for this one. Light brown body, fizzy head formation. Sour aroma, brett noticeable, and olive juice unfortunately. Flavor is sour, lemony, and shows some brett. Stingy on the palate. I did not enjoy this at all.
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;12oz bottle shared by kmweaver. So this is a wheat lager made with a Belgian yeast - at least it smells and tastes that way. Pillowy, perfumy and mildly spicy yeast all over this thing, it smells pretty nice and tastes even better. Strangely delicious, with pepper, tart wheat, orange peel and coriander, though it’s perhaps a little too syrupy in the finish.
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;(12oz bottle, thanks kmweaver) Medium off-white head topped by cloudy amber body. Aroma is medium sweet, Belgian yeast, Bret-lemon sourness, some wheat. Taste is mild sweet, Bret, lemon, some floral, wheat, yeast. Dry light body, light acidity, fairly smooth. Unusual, and quite enjoyable.
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;"12oz bottle, courtesy of Brigadier. Thanks, Nathan! Pours a cloudy, golden-orange color; white head with medium-bubbled lacing. Some pleasant, ephemeral tartness in the aroma: wheat, pepper, and a dense yeastiness. Medium mouthfeel; solid citrus tartness, yeast, and wheatiness; a bit of dustiness creeps in as well, but overall a very drinkable, mildly tart wheat beer. Medium finish, showing dust and tart citrus and some breadiness at the end."
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Provided by kmweaver. Hazy amber with a small white head. The nose is hay, banana, peach, herbs, perfume and pepper. The flavor is fairly dry and watery with wet grains, pepper and peach. Medium/light body is thin with light carbonation.
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Thanks to Nathan for the bottle! Poured clear, brighter golden with a tall, fluffy cap of white head and lots of rising carbonation. The aroma picked up bunches of dusty, peppery yeast, lemon zest, and floral.. sour and engaging. The flavor began with tangy sour lemon on the tip of the tongue, with bread and wheaty notes across the middle, never losing the sour lemony notes.. short, dry finish. I thought the sourness was an interesting twist.. lighter-bodied and grainy on the palate. Very solid stuff!
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Pours with a huge head with a nice lasting cap of foam and good lacing. Grainiest smelling beer ever. Tastes a bit odd, like wheat husks and grass. Interesting but not great.
Mad Brewer Affinity Lager;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Wheat Ale;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;C-Bus 10: Bottle shared by brigadier: Pours a clear copper with an off white head. Aroma, citrus and herbal notes, yeasty, pale bready malts. Flavor, yeasty, citrus, herbal, wheat, and bready malts.
Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle at ChrisOs ’Blue Ridge Mountains Of Virginia’ tasting. Hazy, dark ruby beer. Lasting dark beige head. Some dark syrup. Some dryness. OK, only a bit syrupy.
Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;22nd May 2010. ChrisOs ’Blue Ridge Mountains Of Virginia’ tasting! (Early hours of the morning rating). Light soft palate. Rich yeasty marmite and dark chocolate. Nice.
Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;This beer pours a dark reddish-brown color with a medium beige head that recedes slowly. Rings of lacing on the glass. Sweet malt and molasses in the nose along with a slight chocolate note. Medium, somewhat creamy body with flavors of chocolate malt, caramel, and roasted nuts. The finish is sweet with a lingering malty aftertaste. Decent overall.

Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;bottle at Chris-O ... deep brown .. sweet caramel toffee malts ... burnt sugers ... rich dark fruit malts
Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Experienced from the tap at the brewpub in a nonic glass. The beer pours the characteristic deep brown. The nose brings notes of melonoidins, malt sweetness, but also some toasted notes that are a little bit outside of the style’s guidelines. The flavor is a bit of a disappointment, promising a high level of maltyness up front, but giving far too much toasted and English roasted malt, and an oddly acidic finish.
Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Single purchased at Rozi’s in Lakewood. This pours a very nice heady dark deep brown -very attractive in a tall glass. Aroma is rich and chocolaty, lots and lots of malt flavor here -like an imperial stout, but without the harsh hoppy ale character. This just fills the mouth with smooth sailin’ roasted, chocolaty, sweet malt on malt action. They might have loaded this a bit to heavy on the malt side really. As it warms up it kind of gets gritty. I wish it was a bit more towards the lager side of the coin, might balance it out more.
Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Dark, muddy brown pour leaving a thin tan head and spotty lacing. Impressive aroma of coffee, cream, burnt molasses and dry toast. Mild mouth feel with a velvety smoothness over a medium to thick malt body. Tasty flavors of roasted malt and raisins with plenty of sweet undertones. A rich toffee/caramel presence and big nutty flavor rounds out the exceptional flavor of this bock. Well done Mad Brewer, keep shipping your bombers down this way.
Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;This poured a dark red color with an off white head. Aroma was really malty and some fruits as well. Flavor was a bit watery for a double bock, somewhat malty and yeasty.
Mad Brewer Bunsen Bock;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle in trade from miketd. Thanks! Pours dark clear brown with short lived beige head. Smell is malty, nutty, buttery, creamy and fairly sweet. Taste is dark malt, but still thin flavorwise. Not roasty, but nutty and sweet nut brown ale like with lots of butteriness. Kind of an odd finish to it as well. Perhaps didn’t translate well to the bottle.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;hazy reddish brown with large white head. somewhat citrus hop nose. high carbonation for the style. firm bitterness before minimal citrus hop flavor wth a touch of tangy funk. an old bottle, likely a year or two, that is infected. tough to judge this and unfortunately the brewery closed
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Had on draft at the Mad Brewer. Appearance was a nice dark golden color, with a medium thick head. Smell was of wonderful floral citrus. Taste had a nice roaste. Hops flavor. One of the better consuming IPA’s I have had.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;On tap at the brew keeper. A little flat, with a very simple hop profile. I generally like a hoppy beer, but the level of hops diminishes the ability to detect the subtle flavors.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle thanks to miketd. Pour is dark brown with large tan head. Aroma is floral and pine hops with hints of caramel malt and toffee. Flavor is big pine hop flavor with a nice malty backbone. Well balanced and easy drinking.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;July 17-19, 2008: Hop Fusion IPA has sugary citrusy cascade hops, a bit of pine, and toffee malt in the aroma. It is golden-honey in color and mostly clear with an dense, creamy off-white head an thick, detailed lacing. Lots of hoppiness comes through in the flavor as well. It has a moderate to high pine, citrus, and floral hop flavor and bitterness as well as enough sugary maltiness to keep the beer balanced. This medium-bodied brew is smooth, silky, and mellow on the palate. Overall it is quite good! Draught sample/pint at the Cat’s Eye Saloon and Skipper’s Bar & Grille in Athens, Ohio during Ohio Brew Week 2008. Rating #39 for this beer.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;22 oz. bottle. Clear copper pour with a big, yellow/tan creamy head that sticks around leaving a sliding lace. Piney, spicy hops in the first wave, followed by a more dominant grainy character with substantial caramel. Medium body, soft carbonation that comes as a surprise in the context of the size of the head. Clean palate with a mildly resinous quality. Peppery bitterness starts quickly and overlays a dark caramel and distantly fruity base. The finish is long and bitter. Very respectable, drinkable, a solid performer.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Piney hops, nice bitter kick.. not too sharp.. Nice mouth-feel, medium finish. Easy drinking IPA, very well balanced. Picked up from Habeeb near West Geauga.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle from Beerman6686. Thanks man! Nice hop nose that consists of citrus - orange and grapefruit mainly, tropical punch, a hint of dank, and some caramel malts. Pours dark amber with a thin white head, some lace. Soft toasty flavors, moderate citrus notes - mostly juicy orange, some floral and pine notes as well. Lightly juicy piney resins linger on the palate. Fairly standard nicely drinkable IPA with no flaws.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Dark amber color witha beige head. Aroma of caramel, toffee and citrus hops. Flavor of caramel malts and citrus hops with some spice and tangyness.
Mad Brewer Hop Fusion IPA;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle. Pours a coppery brown with a nice finger or so of beige head. Aromas are odd... white grape juice, pineapple, caramel and bread. Flavor is similar in that it is kind of strange. Malt is very bready and there is not enough hops to balance it out to seem like an IPA. It almost reminds me of the strange offspring of a scotch ale and an IPA.
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;12 oz. bottle, trade from MrBunn. No reason to have held on to this for so long, but I’m paring down my cellar, so here we go at last. Ulp: after sitting still at my desk for half an hour, it still gushes upon opening. Still got most of it into an IPA tulip. Shows an opaque copper color, foamy off-white head. Smell shows more hop resin than most Amarillo beers, There’s also a deep roast malt and even a touch of chocolate smell. So it didn’t gush from infection, at least. Taste is nice and fizzy. Balanced for an American hop profile, full of resin and pine, and still some cocoa from somewhere. a good IPA after a few too many kölsches and wheat beers.
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Found some old notes from a visit to 69 Taps in Medina. The aroma on this was big, sweet and citrusy. The pour is medium golden yellow. the head we medium yellow and frothy. The flavor is hoppy, not too over powering. The finish is long sloppy and syrupy. An enjoyable beer.
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Had this at the tailgate on my way to catch the Salmon. Thanks MrBunn!!! Not sure why this rates so poorly....I thought it was pretty damn good. Nose full of hops, pine and grapefruit, flavor to match. Nicely bitter. Damn tasty on a cold as hell October day by the river!
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Pretty damn weak IPA. Aroma is lacking. Flavor is lacking, except for the odd finish. Starts off a little too sweet and has a strange finish and awkward aftertaste. Overall light in flavor though, with a thin body.
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;22 oz. – Thanks for sharing, ygtbsm94. Dark rusty copper, off white creamy head. Soft toffee and floral pineapple nose with a touch of sweet citrus throughout. Grapefruit hop flavors are decently balanced on a soft earthed caramel foundation. Medium bodied, fizzy carbonation, bittersweet finish. Not bad, not great…
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Experienced at the brewpub in a nonic glass. The idea of crafting an IPA entirely from one variety of hops is worthy of kudos from the creativity standpoint. Unfortunately, this beer disappoints in its execution. The nose is reasonably nice from the style. However, the palate is decidedly off-putting. Harsh bitter combined with some very infection-ish off-flavors render this one a pass.
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Red/orange color with a beige head. Aroma of citrus and fruits. Flavor of some sweet malts and hops. The finish is the best part of this, very long and hoppy.
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;22oz bottle purchased a Simone’s in Lakewood. Pretty sure it was the last bottle and I haven’t seen it elsewhere. Aroma is a buttery floral citrus one, not too overpowering. Flavor is rather thin and somewhat rather gentle for the hops character. This comes off as being a bit too carbonated. Note a bad beer, but low on the IPA scale.
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle. Pours a copper color with a thin but dense head. Aromas are thin, but a nice mix of hops... some pineapple and mango type fruitiness with a little bit of malty sweetness. Flavor is a different story... the malt gets out of control and overwhelms the underdone hops presence... this comes off more like an amber ale or something along those lines. The hops only pick back up in the very late aftertaste and it is pretty fleeting even then.
Mad Brewer Mad-Arillo;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;IPA;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;This poured a dark orange/amber color with and off white head. Aroma was mild citrus hops and some sweetness from the malts as well. Flavor was a terribly aged IPA, very hollow hops flavors and sickenly sweet flavor.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Toasty, caramel, and toffee nose, a light hint of butter, soft fruity notes too. Pours hazy amber with a short lasting head. Flavors of toffee, caramel, some fruity residuals, light english hop bitterness and a hint of butter. Thin almost flabby carbonation. Not much to this, not bad though.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;July 2008: Mad Brewer Infra-Red is transparent, amber-red in color, and has a weak off-white to beige-colored crown. The caramelly aroma foreshadows the flavor. The lightly toasty and toffee maltiness in the flavor is paried with a citrusy and floral hoppiness. There is a slight amaretto-like taste as well. This medium-bodied beer is pretty smooth and is a good representation of an Irisl Ale. It is more well-rounded and most.... Draught sample at The Brew Keeper brewpub in North Ridgeville, Ohio. Rating #9 for this beer.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle shared by me. Thanks dude! Clear red/amber with a thin tan head. Sweet and grainy malt aroma with some cream. Creamy malt flavor with a teeny bit of hop. Not bad, but I would have preferred more hops.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Thanks to JaBier for sharing. The beer is dark amber-brown color with a medium beige head that dissipates steadily. Thin rings of lacing on the glass. Pale malt, caramel and a bit of fruit in the nose. Medium body with flavors of caramel malt, fruit and mild spices. The finish is short and malty. Slightly above average overall.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Dark ruby color with a big beige head. Aroma of grainy malts. Flavor of sweet malts and caramel.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle. Pours a nice red with a large (three fingers or so) beige head. Aromas are kinda boozy with a lot of grainy malt and caramel. Flavor is pretty malty with just a touch of apple fruitiness. Bottle says 4.25% on it... and I’d believe it. It is pretty mild... nice, but mild.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;This poured a red color with an off white head. Aroma was pretty bland but mainly maltiness and some metalixc notes. Flavor is pretty watery with notes of sweet malts and caramela nd not much else. Pretty normal for the style.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Had this on tap at luckys during ohio brew week. Nothing that special from this one. it was easy to drink and i got a light hop presense. Clean finish and a little caramel malt background.
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;"The InfraRed is a very drinkable beer for most any occasion. It is has a medium amber color. I have had several batches of this beer and the degree of hoppiness can vary, but it is always smooth with a very clean finish. Definitely a step above the popular national ""Irish Red"" beer."
Mad Brewer Infra-Red;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Red Ale - Irish;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle courtesy of brigadier. Pours red with a thin white head. Smells malty with some citrussy hints. Tastes of dough, citrus, chewable vitamins, some tea. Decent.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle. Pours dark brown with a minuscule light-brown head. Aroma of chocolate as the name suggests, but also of coffee and other dark malts. Roasty. Flavor is of chocolate, coffee, and more chocolate. A slight amount of alcohol can be detected as well. Overall not bad, could be a bit more smooth, but I would definitely drink it again.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;12oz bottle. Pours thick black with tan head that was soft and long lasting. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Flavors of toffee, coffee, and chocolate, sweet and bitter in the finish. Pretty good stuff.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;From a 12 oz bottle. Big black pour, from the looks I was thinking impy stout. Smell is fairly appetizing and not volatile as an impy stout. Has some dark chocolate on the first taste impressions. Bitter dark chocolate, but certainly it can be tasted. Its choco prevalent, creamy and tasty. A little smooth carbonation but not much. Some roasty bitterness in there settles to the back of the throat during the session. Never gets in your face and I see its styled as a sweet stout on this site. Laid back chocolate continues. Dark choco liquor sticks its head out a little during the finish. Not bad, overall but could use a tad more CO2.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;from old note. good aroma, sweet and roasty. Chocolate.(shocker) and milk. Brownish black color, ok head and lace. Bitter sweet flavor with some fruity noted, berry/cherry. Medium body, smooth creamy mouth feel, bitter dry finish, really grab my attention, but then became kind of lackluster as I sipped. Some how the whole doesn’t equal the sum of it’s parts, if that makes any sense to ya.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with very little head. Aromas are chocolate milk, vanilla and a little bit of charcoal. Flavor is wonderfully smooth (but maybe a little thin). Upon the first sip, I thought this was going to be outstanding... but then for whatever reason, things got a little washed out and the flavors stopped ""popping."" Still, there is a pretty good chocolate presence and that’s nice. Lack of carbonation is a little problematic."
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Enjoyed at the brewpub via a pub glass. The beer pours the characteristic jet black with a long-lasting tan head. The nose gives nots of caramel, milk chocolate, some malt sweetness, and chocolate milk. The palate brings many of the aforementioned notes to the fore, giving a nice malt character, just a touch of roasted malt, and a lot of caramel. Overall, perhaps the best beer that the brewery makes. Extremely well done.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Thanks to Nathan for the bomber! Poured rich, deeper brown with a short, but creamy cap of tan head. The aroma picked up toasty, sweet, milky chocolates and some slightly darker ones with accents of earth and a bit of detergent deep down.. seemed to dry out as it warmed up, leaving a cake-like impression. The flavor had more of the sweet chocolates than anything else with creamy, milky accents.. light chocolate and coffee bitterness around.. underlying cardboard character.. finished with more chocolate and some caramel, but it wasn’t that tasty. Medium-bodied at most and a tad watery on the palate.. semi-sweet and grainy.. OK stuff in here, but nothing with pulling power.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Dark brown with a small brown head. Aroma and flavor of roasted malts and chocolate.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle. DrHomolka. Black pour small head. Aroma of chocolate and more chocolate with some toffee notes and espresso. Flavor is very chocolatey but thin. Finishes with a roasty coffee flavor.
Mad Brewer 2Ch2St - Double Chocolate Stout;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;This pours a dark dark brown with a light tan head. Aroma is of sweet chocolate and dark roasted malts. Flavor is a bit dryer than the aroma, not much chocolate, but mainly dry roastedness and hints of smoke and ash.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;12 oz bottle pours dark amber with bubbly tan head. Aroma dominated by clove with touch of cinnamon and coriander. Decent sweet caramel flavor and touch of bitterness. Leaves a slick buttery squash flavor on the tongue. Decent pumpkin ale.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;12oz. Pours a dark amber with a small white head. Aroma is nice pumpkin spice, not the same as every other pumpkin beer thankfully. Just a nice pumpkin pie aroma, don’t know how else to explain it. Flavor is pumpkin, caramel, vanilla. Nice. This is one of the better pumpkin beers I’ve had. Gets points for being different. Not just a spicy bland amber ale like 90% of the others.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;9/04/2008: Mad Brewer Boo Beer pours a transparent deep brown color with a medium, foamy tan head. Pumpkin, spice, cinammon, clove, and some sweet caramelized sugars are present in the aroma. This beer is roasty and has a pumpkin pie base with caramelized malts and psice. It is kind of like spice cake with raisins and some roasted ginger added. It has a medium-medium-full body and is quite tasty overall. I would call this a very drinkable and pleasing pumpking ale. 1 pint, 6 fl. oz. bottle (5.7 alc. by vol.) shared by Tmoney99. Thanks Tom! Rating #17 for this beer.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;22 oz. bottle shared by Tmoney99. Pours a hazy dark amber/brown color with a small beige head. The aroma is moderately sweet pumpkin with nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar. The flavor is centered around moderately sweet pumpkin with a nice blend of spices (nutmeg, others) and cinnamon. A slight bitterness in the finish. This was my first experience with this brewer and for a pumpkin beer I found it to be a positive one.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;22oz bottle. Nutty looking Bombay Mahogany color with a light head. Very spicy aroma with clove. Very perfume like. Clove is very noticeable in the flavor and I think there might be a bit much spice as the brew is kind of astringently bitter. Not sure I get any molasses flavor (maybe in a burnt sugar sort of way) but I was thinking more along the lines of ginger and cinnamon. Light sweetness is over powered by the spice and bitterness. Wet mouth feel with bitter finish. Not great, but still drinkable.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;"<i>22 oz bottle</i> <br /><br /> Overall I think Mad Brewer has done a great job of setting themselves up as a respectable local brewery. Whenever I get the chance to pick up a new release I always give it serious consideration over national releases. This particular beer is not one of their best; in this season’s crop of pumpkin ales I would place it firmly in the middle. Better than another local offering (Thirsty Dog) it falls short of being worth a second look nonetheless. <br /><br /> <b>Aroma / Appearance</b> - A deep burgandy body is graced by a huge head which takes a few minutes to settle down. Nutmeg, spices, and ripe pumpkin are what you would expect to find and you do. It reminds me of a pie before the whipped cream has been swirled on. <br /><br /> <b>Flavor / Palate</b> - Squash and spices were not exactly what I had in mind when I bought the bottle. The nutmeg isn’t so bad but the slight vegetal flaw knocks this down a few points. The odd finish doesn’t help either. In the end I feel like this is a good step towards improving on it next year; as long as progress is made eventually something solid will be sold in a few years time. In the meantime save your money."
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Thanks to Ja Bier for sharing a bottle. The beer pours a lightly hazed brownish-amber color with a thin beige head that recedes steadily. Spotty lacing on the glass. Malty aroma with notes of brown sugar. Medium-bodied with a flavor reminiscent of apple butter. Notes of malt and spices behind the fruityness. The finish is sweet and fruity with bits of brown sugar and pumpkin left behind. Pretty good all around.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Thanks go to Nathan for the bottle! Poured much darker than anticipated.. deep cherry pit colored with just a dusting of tan head when you agitate it. The aroma picked up deep, slightly sour pumpkin meat, nutmeg, and cinnamon with a bit of maple syrup if you dig really deep. The flavor amped up the spices and the sourness at the expense of some pumpkin meat.. the molasses showed up at the core.. cinnamon and cloves were the primary spices around.. finished sour with the pie spices. Medium-bodied with not too great balance between the slow-moving molasses sweetness and the brighter spices and sourness.. somewhat refreshing at the finish.. OK stuff.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Sample from 22oz bottle at the Brewkeeper tasting at Blacklick Wine and Spirits on 10/9/08. Pours a medium brown with no head. Aroma of cinnamon, allspice, pumpkin and apple. Flavor is pumpkin pie and apple pie, with lots of spice and a bit of tartness. Could stand to be a little sweeter, but this beer is perfectly spiced. I prefer more alcohol, but in the days when everyone is imperializing everything, it’s refreshing to see someone take a more traditional stab at a pumpkin ale. Fine beer.
Mad Brewer Boo Beer;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;Flavored - Other;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle. Pours dark Amber/brown with thin head. Aroma is pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, and spices. Flavor is cinnamon, slight pumpkin, and spices. Finishes clean with very little lingerng aftertaste.
Etna Bräu;Acireale (CT), Italy;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;La Caverna del Mastro Birraio;A perfectly decent lager, crisp, dry and refreshing after a hike. Pale colour, fine head. Draught at Hotel Corsaro, south slope of Mount Etna.
Vallecellio Chiara;Cellio (VC), Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vallecellio;oro schiuma media discreta persitemza naso delicato poco amara lieve erbaceo un po di lievito
Vallecellio Chiara;Cellio (VC), Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vallecellio;A Mes rate: 50cl bottle thanks to Reakt. Hazy pale gold with a very thin white head. Heavy rice and corn with some sickly sweet yeasty notes and an almost chewy spicy malt finish. Dull and far from great.
Vallecellio Chiara;Cellio (VC), Italy;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Vallecellio;Cloudy blond color. Malt aroma. Medium mouthfeel, some malt flavor, correct bitterness. Raw but not bad.
Vallecellio Castagna;Cellio (VC), Italy;Flavored - Other;Vallecellio;Bottle Con castagne del Brinzio discreto ambrato buona schiuma un po grossolana media persistenza note fruttate leggero affumicato lieve nota dolce discreta secchezza amaro contenuto piuttosto effervescente
Vallecellio Castagna;Cellio (VC), Italy;Flavored - Other;Vallecellio;Bottiglia da 50 cl. Birra di colore ambrato chiaro con schiuma di grana media e abbondante mediamente persistente. Al naso non offre profumi intensi, si percepisce un leggero affumicato e qualche nota legnosa. Al palato si presenta con un corpo abbastanza leggero e lascia un retrogusto legnoso leggermente affumicato. Nel complesso risulta abbastanza bilanciata anche se la castagna non si fa sentire in maniera decisa.
Vallecellio Castagna;Cellio (VC), Italy;Flavored - Other;Vallecellio;"A Mes rate: 50cl bottle thanks to Reakt. Lovingly labelled as ""Can’t stand ya"" by Ang. :) Semi hazy amber colour with a thin tan head. Very Belgian spicy yeast aroma. Tastes almost identical to their rice beer with some darker malt and light smoky notes. Lots of caramel, almost sickly but stopping just short. Pretty much instant finish. Alcohol is virtually non-existant. Quite like this brewer. None of them are particularly special but they are certainly different and I think that deserves at least a few props."
Vallecellio Castagna;Cellio (VC), Italy;Flavored - Other;Vallecellio;"Hazy amber color; big head. The aroma is malty and genty smoked. Medium body, with caramel flavor and light malt, dry mouthfeel, with some smokeyness. Pleasant."
Dead Frog Nut Brown - Oaked;Aldergrove, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Dead Frog Brewery;Aroma of chocolate, nut and caramel. Dark brown colour. Taste includes chocolate, coffee, caramel, nuts. It’s a mix of bitterness and sweetness.
Dead Frog Nut Brown - Oaked;Aldergrove, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Dead Frog Brewery;Pint on tap pours brown in color with a finger of off-white head that leaves some spotted lacing on the glass. Aroma is light roasted grains with some hints of caramel and chocolate. Taste is a light roasted grain bitterness with a caramel and light chocolate malty sweetness with some notes of oak. Nicely done and recommended.
Dead Frog Nut Brown - Oaked;Aldergrove, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Dead Frog Brewery;Mint, vanilla, caramel and chocolate in the aroma. Opaque and murky tan-brown body is topped by a dense, fine bubbled white head that lasts well and coats the glass as it descends. Nutty flavour is strong and the hops shine through nicely. Oak is subdued and offers a pleasant counterpoint. Medium body with creamy smooth carbonation and very soft, quiet but lasting carbonation that works really well. A very well-crafted beer although, I’m still not entirely sure it’s my thing... Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Dead Frog Nut Brown - Oaked;Aldergrove, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Dead Frog Brewery;(Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival 2007 in Victoria on September 8th, 2007. Green tea flavour. Wow. Tea-bagging goodness.
Dead Frog Nut Brown - Oaked;Aldergrove, British Columbia, Canada;Brown Ale;Dead Frog Brewery;Cloudy brown. Rich head. Light caramel aroma with graham crackers. Light palate, but the oak exerts a definite influence. Nicely balanced - the oak livens up this normally staid brew, lends a hint of tartness in the finish and that cuts through the sweetness while leaving behind all the nutty brown ale character. I really like what the oak does to this brew - this should be a permanent change.
Big Ridge Honey Matcha Ginger Lemon Cream;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Big Ridge Brewing Co.;Strong ginger soda-like aroma with lemon curd and some pastry like sweetness is interesting but doesn’t have a lot of beer character to it. Opaque yellow body is topped by a low, fine bubbled, white head that recedes rapidly to a slight ring. Crisp malts (and wheat?) underlie the lemon fruitiness. Ginger is strong and lingers especially in the aftertaste. Light, refreshing body with modest carbonation. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Big Ridge Honey Matcha Ginger Lemon Cream;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Big Ridge Brewing Co.;Hazy beige colour. Very gingery aroma with lemon...kind of soda-like, but a soda I’d drink every now and again. Quite lemony flavour, sweetish, and a little bit fizzy. Not a bad brew, leans towards Zimaness, but in retrospect it’s definitely one of the better-balanced ones on the day.
Big Ridge Candied Apricot;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Big Ridge Brewing Co.;Wheat and banana are strong in the nose along with a sugary sweetness. Opaque yellow tan body is topped by a low but lasting white head that leaves some sudsy lacing. Banana flavour is strong with plenty of tart wheat. Sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Medium light body with somewhat low carbonation. A decent hefeweizen, but I’m not really noticing any contribution from the apricot. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Big Ridge Candied Apricot;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Big Ridge Brewing Co.;Hazy pale yellow with minimal head. Aroma is banana and some wheat with a touch of yeast. Lots of body and flavour on this with nice wheat flavour and slightly citrus. Hardly notice any apricot which is ok as the beer is very enjoyable.
Big Ridge Candied Apricot;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Big Ridge Brewing Co.;Based on a hefeweizen - the brewer is new from the Hefe that Joe and I rated and from this brew the new Hefe is quite a bit better than that old one. Cloudy pale yellow. Marshmallow, banana on the nose. Full-bodied, malty character...almost a bit too much. I like the icing sugar note but there’s a little olive oil slickness in the mouthfeel that detracts. Honestly, not much apricot in this (in terms of amount, there actually is, but it doesn’t show through). Enjoyable, fluffy hefe, though.
Storm Ginger Ginseng Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Storm Brewing (BC);Huge and overpowering ginger aroma is harsh at first but mellows a bit. Some lemon fruitiness is also apparent as it warms. Pale white-yellow coloured body topped by a shy white fully diminishing head. Ginger and ginseng flavours are quite overwhelming although there is some pleasant malt character in the aftertaste. Medium body with short-lived but sharp and pointy, hard bubbled carbonation. This must have been force carbonated? Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Storm Ginger Ginseng Pilsner;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Storm Brewing (BC);Hazy pale yellow. Um....this smells like jalapeno pepper. Not much else here. On the palate it becomes clear - it’s not jalapeno but ginseng. So apparently if you put way, way too much ginseng in something it will smell like jalapeno. Anyway, horribly one-dimensional, far too far over the top. People eat ginseng for its health benefits, not its flavour. Win some, lose some.
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Smells of good fresh basil, some minty character as fresh basil sometimes has. Has a nice gold body with big white foam on top. Flavour is nice mellow sweet fresh basil and hop hints on the back end. Good oiliness on the mouth. This has great herbal character.
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Cloudy gold, white head. Considerable basil in nose and palate. Slightly dry, long hop finish
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);"Draught at the brewery Cloudy deep blond color. The basil gives a strong minty accent to a powerful and hoppy IPA, more in the flavor; I’d be glad to try a basil beer also with a lighter beer. Good result."
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Sampled at VCBW 2012 in Vancouver pouring a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves some spotted lacing. Aroma is dominated by the basil with a bit of earthiness. Taste is basil with a light malty sweetness and light earthy hop bitterness. Light bodied with moderate carbonation leaving a pleasant sensation on the palate. Must have been a one time beer if it is retired already.
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);On tap. Pours a hazy yellow with little head. Basil all the way - aroma and taste. Drinkable, obvious ale base, but needs to be matched with food. Why does spaghetti come to mind?
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);On cask at CAMRA appreciation night at Ensemble Tap. Pours a hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma is dominated by the intense basil - this is no subtle addition - nothing much else noticeable. Flavour is no less subtle, completely coating the mouth in basil, very tastefully - drowning out the hops and whatever else there is. Bizarre, but it works quite well.
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Strong peppery basil entices the nose. At first it rather overwhelms the malt but a certain toasty and caramel sweetness is apparent after a while as well. Clear golden body is topped by a decent, fine bubbled, white head that recedes rapidly to a thin but lasting cover and rings the glass throughout the drink marking it’s retreat. Basil flavour is peppery and fresh and serves as a nice complement to the round malty sweetness. Bitterness is quite pronounced but not overwhelming and the spiciness rides on through in the aftertaste. Medium light body has a creamy texture with generous, soft bubbled carbonation. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Pale and slightly hazy with nice head and retention. Beer is herby with basil dominating the nose. The flavour is very strong on the basil side which was rather enjoyable and unique. The malts are tehre and the hops take a little of a backseat to the basil. Not quite as bitter as many IPA. Great if you like basil, really good if you like a unique ipa. I wonder if a whole pint or two would get wearing?
Storm Basil IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;IPA;Storm Brewing (BC);Light hazy pale. Big basil nose. OK, I like basil. The flavour is also big basil. It actually works in the sense that the hop bitterness still shines through and complements the herbal blast quite well. You still have to love basil to tolerate this brew, but at least it works on the palate.
Storm Wormwood IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Storm Brewing (BC);Curiously soapy, floral, woody aroma is not really all that enticing but not entirely off-putting either. Hazy yellow-tan coloured body is topped by a low, off white head that recedes to a thin partial cover with spotty lacing. Pronounced and lingering bitterness is almost overwhelming at first but after a bit some floral and woody notes and malt sweetness emerge in the middle of the taste. Medium body with moderate, soft bubbled carbonation. Quite nice on the tongue. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Storm Wormwood IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Storm Brewing (BC);Cloudy yellow,creamy lasting white head.Light malt nose. Huge gross bitterness from wormwood(aspirins).Great lace
Storm Wormwood IPA;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Storm Brewing (BC);This is the second go at a Wormwood IPA. The first one was a 0.5 - totally undrinkable with bitterness far beyond anything I’ve ever tasted. This time the dose has been cut a bit. Hazy tan colour. Woody aroma - sort of a potent aroma accented by Storm’s typical earthy English hops. Massive bitterness - not as extreme as last time but still up there. And the bitterness of wormwood simply isn’t as cohesive as hop bitterness is. What isn’t overwhelmed is some of the pale malt and house yeast.
Yaletown Old British Brown (AKA Brett Brown);Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Sour / Wild Beer;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Sample glass. Dark amber brown. Good head and lace. Weird, a brown with Brett. Sour malty aroma. Friendly approachable starter Brett beer.
Yaletown Old British Brown (AKA Brett Brown);Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Sour / Wild Beer;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Certainly not a sour, nothing sour is evident. Brown, with lasting beige head. Nose is sweet with brown sugar overtones. Light sweet malt profile, again with brown sugar. Decent body for the style. Again no acetic quality whatsoever.
Yaletown Old British Brown (AKA Brett Brown);Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Sour / Wild Beer;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Butterscotch is very strong in the aroma. Carmel and sour vinegar like note are also apparent. Opaque brown body is topped by a low tan head that recedes to partial cover with some patchy lace. Butterscotch is thankfully less notable in the flavour revealing some nutty malt character, vanilla and a slight tartness. Medium light body is a bit on the thin side with fair carbonation. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Yaletown Old British Brown (AKA Brett Brown);Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Sour / Wild Beer;Yaletown Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpubIt’s been three months since the early release at Caskival and the brew has a new name. Those three months have helped A LOT. Hazy chestnut colour and impressively thick head. Vague aroma of nuts, chocolate and even lime - mole and a mojito? Gentle brett melds well with sweet nutty malts. Light on the toast. At this point, pretty well balanced - like a decent brown ale with a bit of bretty signature. Not what the brewer originally intended but it’s a pretty unique brew that does harken back to a bygone era of brewing. Six months since brewing, at Caskival. Chestnut brown. Not much head, but what is there is lasting. Smoked raisins, Ritter Sport dark and singed lettuce make for a bizarre aroma. Thin body. It has some dark cherry and oak notes like you want but they are underneath of some malt vinegar, caramel and diacetyl. Hmmm...it’s a bit sweet, too, with only a tiny splash of tartness. It’s definitely not ready yet, as the brett seems to have only just started working. By October, this should be hitting its stride a bit more...I hope. Ar 3 Ap 3 F 3 P 2 O 7 = 1.8
Crannog Three Fingers Cherry Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Crannog Ales;Cherry aroma is quite sour. Some wheat is also apparent. Very hazy, deep blonde coloured body is topped by a slight white head that recedes rapidly to ring. Lightly sour wheat and cherry flavour. Medium body with fairly low carbonation. Aside from a sticky sweetness, I found the mead was not really apparent. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Crannog Three Fingers Cherry Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Crannog Ales;Cherry aroma dominates the nose. Slightly tart from the cherry but not overpowering. The mead was hardly noticeable and but for the description I probably would have not recognized the flavour it added.
Crannog Three Fingers Cherry Ale;Sorrento, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Crannog Ales;Hazy pinkish-beige. Light aroma has some cherry, not a ton else. Light cherry accents on the palate. The mead (sans smoke) comes through quite a bit in a warming umami kind of way, but doesn’t seem to meld all that well with the beer. (Speakings of...another meadery in BC wouldn’t hurt in the slightest.) The cherry is light, slightly tart. I’m not huge on Pooka to begin with, and I’d probably prefer the mead on its own.
Taylors Crossing Fig & Anise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Red Truck Beer Company;(Draught) Sampled at Dix X-mas Xtreme Caskival 2007. Pours a partially cloudy light amber body with no head. Nose of black licorice. Very medicinal, skunky. All gross with a late maltedness that couldn’t save this poor recipe.
Taylors Crossing Fig & Anise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Red Truck Beer Company;Cloudy yellow with a small head. The nose is mostly anise which flows into the flavor as well. Slightly sweet, but no figs really. The anise is a bit much as it may be covering other flavors/aromas.
Taylors Crossing Fig & Anise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Red Truck Beer Company;Huge anis aromadoesn’t leave much room for anything else. Hazy blonde body with plenty of yeast in suspension is topped by a low white head that recedes to a wispy cover and slight ring. Flavour is dominated by anise but has an underlying malty sweetness. Medium light body with moderate carbonation. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Taylors Crossing Fig & Anise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Red Truck Beer Company;Light amber with minimal head. Aroma is dominated by anise and a touch of other herbs. Strong anise flavour but the body is thick enough to hold the flavour. Nice and malty finish. An interesting attempt that does a decent job.
Taylors Crossing Fig & Anise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Red Truck Beer Company;Beigey-amber colour. Huge anise aroma - one dimensional, this one. The body is good, malts present in the backbone but the anise is way over the top. Not finding much fig. It’s drinkable, and if the anise was dialed down a bit to allow the fig and malts to show a bit more, this could work well. But anise is not the sort of flavour normally used so up-front. It’s suited as an accent in cooking, and beer would be the same IMO.
Taylors Crossing Mole Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Red Truck Beer Company;"Cinnamon, pepper and cloves over earthy chocolate in the nose. Opaque milky brown body is topped by a shy, off white, fully diminishing head. Spices dominate the flavour overpowering any beer character. Woody cumin overwhelms even the chocolate. Medium body is quite still and syrupy with almost no carbonation to add interest. Marinade, maybe; but a full glass? Not me. Go figure this was the pick of the festival from the assembled brewers... Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007)."
Taylors Crossing Mole Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Other;Red Truck Beer Company;"Dave Varga’s cat killed a mole and his dog brought it back and dumped it into the brew kettle despite being told repeatedly to ""sit"" and ""drop that dead thing on the floor"". Either that or this is based on mole poblano. I know my beer and I know my mole so let’s rock.Brown colour and really sludgey-looking. The aroma is sharp - oregano, cinnamon, pepper, vinegar and way too much cumin, even for a mole. Very spicy character. I like the chipotle heat; I don’t like the mouthfeel being all powdery from the overdose of cumin; I like the concept and the subtle chocolate; I don’t like the over-the-top sense of balance. It’s barely drinkable. I love cumin as much as the next guy but this is far too much.My take: The concept is great and after a few batches of adjustments this could completely rock. The first suggestion I’d make is to replace powdered cumin with toasted cumin seeds. The powder affects the mouthfeel too much and the seeds will be far less likely to overwhelm the flavour and aroma of the beer. Mole isn’t about clobbering you with one dominant characteristic, it’s about blending a million different things together seamlessly. For beermaking purposes I guess the toasting would have to be done in an oven rather than by frying in oil.My second suggestion - mix up the ingredients a bit. You don’t need it all in there to replicate the key components of a mole (I’d especially skip the turkey!). I’d leave out the cinnamon and cloves entirely. The cinnamon should come from the Mexican chocolate. Only one brand I know of in Vancouver that is all-natural and thus ideal for mole (or mole beer) and that is Rey Amargo, which can be found at Los Guerreros on Kingsway at Joyce. European-style chocolate is not appropriate for mole.I would also add some ancho to the mix. I love chipotle but this needs a more complex chile character. I wouldn’t want the heat to be jacked up much higher though, so ancho is the best choice. I think there should be some herb character - oregano is nice, maybe some epazote would be cool, too. In terms of some of the other elements of a mole, nuts are probably to oily to add, plantains or tomatillos might be too whacked-out but some raisins wouldn’t hurt at all. Anyway, just some thoughts..."
Russell White Peach Honey Blonde;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;Butterscotch is the strongest note in an otherwise mild aroma. Hazy blonde body is topped by a low, white, fully diminishing head. Stale flavour is papery. No fruit, no hops, no malt really stand out. Vague sweetness lingers. Light body is watery in texture with little or no carbonation to be found. Sampled on cask at Dix (Caskival 2007).
Russell White Peach Honey Blonde;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Russell Brewing Company;Hazy blonde. Peach, bread, diacetyl in the aroma. Very light body and flavour. Some mild bread and yeastiness. Only hints at spice, and there’s hardly any fruit at all. In my experience, you need to shove a whole peach tree into a brew to get any flavour out of those things, so this isn’t too big a surprise.
Medium Draft;Urasoe-City, Okinawa, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Orion Breweries Limited (Asahi);Pours a pale yellow color w/ a medium spritzy froth. Hangtime is NIL yet has decent residual lacing. Aroma is a tad musty. Medium nectar w/ ample residual effers. Big flavors are packed in this lite looking brew. Possesses a nice mild fruity quality and finishes w/ a brisk bittering component. A full flavored lager w/ no offensive nuances.
Central City Premium Lager;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Wow. Fantastic lager from a great ale brewery. Brilliantly clear with perfect head. Crisp hoppy nose and extremely sessionable. It’s bitter for a lager. The hops are quite welcome as they hide some of the lingering DMS. But the DMS doesn’t get too in the way. I had a pint at the pub in Surrey and I would’ve scored higher, but the cans I brought back did not have as much flavor stability. Oh well, they’ll hammer that out when they open the production facility.
Central City Premium Lager;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Central City Brewers + Distillers;"Can. Crisp gold with steady carbonation and a light soft foam head. Light but intriguing aroma; sweetness, grass and cookie. Should be more pronounced. Kind of meaty body. Hint of hop spice. Flavour is mixture of vegetable, grass and cookie with a bit of pepper in the back end and finish."
Central City Premium Lager;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Can : Gold with small fast fading white head.Grainy nose. Bland slightly sweet malt flavor....basically a macro, but nothing offensive.
Central City Premium Lager;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Can, from the Central City beer storeGolden colour with largish bubbles. Somewhat continental graininess in the nose with apple notes and herbal hops. Body is a bit thin - certainly the watery character emphasizes a lack of body, making it seem thinner than it probably is. Light apple notes come in late, and the malts are doughy. The finish is an amalgam of dough, apple, and water. Not CC’s finest hour.
Central City Premium Lager;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Cans: Labelled Central City Premium Lager, is the Springboard draft different or is this just rebranded? Pours a pale gold with a thin white head. Aroma is thin malty character with very light but noticable citric hoppiness and that is mirrored in the flavour. I’m not much for drinking lagers in general, but I thought this one was decent for value. Better than Bowen Islands Traditional Lager which is the only other comparable brew I’ve had recently.

Central City Red Racer Pale Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Central City Brewers + Distillers;355 ml can from the supermarket. Appears an almost clear dark golden color, with plenty of suspended particles, topped with a finger of white froth which dissipates rapidly. Aromas are muted and subtle, sosome citrusy and floral hops in there. Taste is also restrained, a bit if citrus fruit sweetness, mild pine with a hint of bitter. Surprisingly muted overall, despite a hefty malt bill which gives it a solid medium body.
Central City Red Racer Pale Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Central City Brewers + Distillers;Slightly e hops then the IPA that I really enjoy but still a very good red ale. Smooth and again was priced less then other good red ales.

Sweet fruity flavour of grainy biscuit malt, caramel, orange, grapefruit, peach and pine resin with a dry, bitter, floral hop finish. Medium body with a slick texture and average carbonation. Well balanced.
Central City Red Racer Pale Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Pale Ale - American / APA;Central City Brewers + Distillers;This is my favorite from the Red Racer line up and it is in one word - underrated. Maris Otter malt gives it a luscious feel and overall, the beer has a strong hop forward profile yet it isn’t overpowering , but it certainly has a strong presence - luxurious it is this brew. This is your Maserati amongst the other northwest pale ales on the market. Big ups to Central City on this one - blue can is my go to now - Thank you.
Boundary Bay Old Bounder - Oak Aged;Bellingham, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boundary Bay Brewery;draft at bigwood. pours an opaque mahogany with faint caramel edges. dense, creamy tan head. lots of residual malt sugar showing through on the nose, along with plenty of booze and bourbon. creamy, grainy medium body. caramel, a little dark fruit, bourbon, and vodka mid palate. long earthy twangy finish.
Boundary Bay Old Bounder - Oak Aged;Bellingham, Washington, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Boundary Bay Brewery;2006 Vintage. Toasted French oak.Gorgeous amber-red colour. Sugary-vanilla overtones on the nose, under which a rich caramelly and subtlely fruit barley wine lies. Snappy taste - incredibly rich malts in the earthy-toffeeish vein meld very well with masculine oaky notes, hints of vanilla and even hints of bacterial tartness. This is what I want in a BA brew - a gorgeous accent rather than an overwhelming dominance of barrel, something that adds to the existing beer and takes it to new levels rather than crushing the poor palate into submission.
Boundary Bay Cabin Fever - Oak Aged;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;Draft - Caramel, chocolate and some light barrel notes. Dirty brown with a decent beige head. Sweet barrel notes, caramel and a sweet decent finish. Quite a bit of barrel notes, but decent.
Boundary Bay Cabin Fever - Oak Aged;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;2014 vintage. On tap at WA Winter Beer Festival 2015, pours a murky reddish brown with a small beige head. Aroma brings out English bready malts, whiskey barrels, and toffee. Flavour is a whiskey bomb, with loads of barrels and booze, followed by English bready malt and some toffee. Rather harsh and boozy, but it’s very pleasant in its abrasive mess. I enjoyed it.
Boundary Bay Cabin Fever - Oak Aged;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;12oz draft at Brouwer’s. Pours a still dark brown with a few bubbles. Nose is sweet apple, date and brown sugar...but really too much apple. Thin watery body with more apple and caramel. A bit of spice and a touch of barrel, but I ended up giving the rest of this to someone else.

Boundary Bay Cabin Fever - Oak Aged;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;Deep mahogany color with a tan head. Spicy brown ale and wood bourbon aromas. Medium body. Rich oaky spicy toasted caramel flavors with a taste of vanilla. Overall this ones on the sweet side, and a nice twist to the base brew.
Boundary Bay Cabin Fever - Oak Aged;Bellingham, Washington, United States;Strong Ale - English;Boundary Bay Brewery;Cloudy dark amber/light brown colour with a bare minimum of head. Big, oaky nose with toffeeish elements underneath, late toast and alcohol. Flavourwise, this is light, toasty, oaky with a toffeeish accent and a hint of late alcohol. The oak is an interesting accent but ultimately its neither here nor there.
Nethergate Hogwash;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask conditioned handpump Dukes Arms Woodford 18/02/13. A copper coloured beer with a white head and lace. A bit soapy. Light fruits. Quite ordinary and clean but drinkable. Served too cold as well.

Nethergate Hogwash;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask at Blue Boar, Billericay. Pours a light orange brown with a thin white head. Malty orange notes on the nose with a little burnt sugar in the background. This beer washes very lightly over the tongue and leaves a watery orange caramel taste with an undercurrent of bready malt. The aftertaste doesn’t offer much either with a dry slightly sugary syrup bitter sweetness. An uninspiring ale mainly due to that lack of assertiveness by any element. i get the feeling that this beer isn’t actually trying as hard as it could.
Nethergate Hogwash;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;A - dried fruit A - golden-brown with thin head T - sweet P - mid and smooth O - decent
Nethergate Hogwash;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;(Cask at Wenlock Arms, London, 10 Aug 2007) Amber colour with brief, white head. Fruity nose with apricots and earthy hops. Fruity taste with notes of apricots, honey and balanced doses of earthy hops in the finish. Malt sweetness shining through. Decent summer brew, but a tad too sweet for me.

Milestone Colonial Reserve;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Milestone Brewery;Bottle from Pig’s Ear 2008, bb 28 Aug 2009, at least 4 years old Cloudy dark amber color, with a lot of sediment. Some aroma of malt, oxidisation, sourness. Oxidized malt flavor, some caramel, some alcohol perception, and moderate but distrurbing sourness. Ok, it’s old, but a real Barley Wine should hold up longer.

Fruity finish.
Milestone Colonial Reserve;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Milestone Brewery;10th May 2009 Cloudy amber beer. Slightly dry and crisp palate. Reasonable carbonation. Says it’s a barleywine but really comes accross as a sour beer and a decent one at that! Good sourish malt that tickles the tastebuds without ever approaching lambic like acid. A little sweet malt at the end. Dry sour aftertaste.
Milestone Colonial Reserve;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Milestone Brewery;Bottle @ pre-GBBF shindig, August 2009. Very murky from the bottom of the bottle. Tastes muddy. Sweet and sour notes. Not too appealing, maybe infected, or perhaps just too sludgy? Default score. Flagged for re-rate.
Milestone Colonial Reserve;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Milestone Brewery;Bottle 50cl. @ Chriso’s pre GBBF Shindig ’09.

Milestone Colonial Reserve;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Milestone Brewery;A Mes rate: bottle at the ever brilliant Chris O’s Pre GBBF Extravaganza. Amber colour with a thin beige head. Bloody awful aroma of oxidised toffee. The flavour is much better but still no showstopper. A barley wine that is big on the fruit. Faint sourness works well. Big sticky finish. Not great.
Milestone Colonial Reserve;Newark, Nottinghamshire, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Milestone Brewery;Bottle at the legend of chriso’s pre GBBF09 tasting. Alround rating: Big tart barley wine, huge malt bill makes it very sweet and quite hard to drink, the vinous character should be balancing but just makes it sickly cloying.
Grand River Mill Race Mild;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Mild Ale;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);Appearance: clear amber-brown with one finger of creamy ivory head diminishing gradually to a thin cap, patchy lacing. (4/5) Aroma: dark roasty malt, cocoa, vinous red berries, citrus. (7/10) Taste: moderate-low sweet, mild bitter, light tart. (7/10) Medium body, moderate-soft carbonation, off-dry slightly sticky finish. (4/5) Wow, these guys are just nailing the traditional styles. First, an amber that I actually enjoy, and now a mild that’s actually interesting even though it’s got an ABV that you could feed to a kid. (Well, almost. If it were at the end of hectic day, maybe, and you just wanted a few minutes’ peace and quiet…) Despite the fairly forbidding colour, this thing is mild and approachable, and I hesitate to even call the body “medium”. Gotta be one of the best milds I’ve ever had. (15/20)

Trailhead Unfiltered Honey Wheat;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Trailhead Brewing Co.;It poured a yellowish color with a white head. The aroma was honey with a touch of some malt. The taste was sweet with flavors of honey, wheat, and some malt vinegar taste.
Trailhead Unfiltered Honey Wheat;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Draft from the brewpub. A dirty tan orange color with no head. My glass was quite sour with unripe passion fruit. Some honey was taste late. Very odd and the weakest wheat offering I have had.
Trailhead Unfiltered Honey Wheat;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Tasted 8/2/09. Draft from the Brewpub. Hazy with a pale golden hue. Clinging layer of white head. Wheaty floral aromas with a touch citrus. Light to medium bodied with crisp palate. Nice mellow mix of citrus, toast and honey. Easy and very sessionable. Mild effervescence. Sweet honey notes juxtaposition with the dry cereal malts. Trace hops in the finish. No flaws, but uninspiring.
Trailhead Unfiltered Honey Wheat;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Hazy golden pour leaving some nice lacing. Grainy malt nose with some honey notes and very light spice. Pretty heinous though, a trainwreck of honey and bananas.
Trailhead Unfiltered Honey Wheat;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Trailhead Brewing Co.;Sample at the brewpub: Trailhead’s seasonal selection pours a hazy yellow color with a thin white head that is gone pretty quickly. Top ring of lacing with spots underneath. The aroma is sweet honey with a touch of sweet malt. Light-bodied and sweet with flavors of honey and wheat, and also with an odd malt vinegar taste. The finish is sweet honey with more vinegar. Overall this was passable at first but the vinegar character really interfered with enjoying the beer more.
Trailhead Unfiltered Honey Wheat;St. Charles, Missouri, United States;Wheat Ale;Trailhead Brewing Co.;"Draft, at Trailhead. This seems to have nothing to do with the ""St. Louis Swarm Honey Wheat,"" since it’s just called ""Unfiltered Honey Wheat"" on the brewer’s web page. Lemonade-yellow at the sides of the glass, but with a thicker orange in the center. The head fizzes out in a few minutes. A lemony weizen smell, thankfully served without a slice. Taste is okay, but too much of a standard beer with a bit of lemon zest. Mothfeel is sometimes watery, then shows a bit of substance. Light and insubstantial, but may be what’s needed on these frickin’ hot Missouri days. Looked spectacular at the start."

Dùm Double IPA;Prague, Czech Republic;IPA;Pivovarský Dùm;Draught at the brewpub as IPA American style. Hazy dark golden colour. Big stable tan head. The aroma has a good grassy hop note.

Dùm Double IPA;Prague, Czech Republic;IPA;Pivovarský Dùm;"(Draught at Pivovarský Dum, Praha, on July 31, 2007) Shady orange color, fluffy tan head. Nice big hoppy scent. Nice bitter floral and herbal hoppy taste. Medium mouthfeel, rather high bitterenss. From taste and mouthfeel, counting also bitterness, I wouldn’t call this a double IPA. Though a ""single"" IPA it is for sure! Maybe it was just me after about a week in Germany and a few days in Czech, but this beer was awesome!

An overall impression of cooked fruits from a baked pie. I didn’t like the finish at all which had a “dirty” feel to it. Czech brewers really are the masters of Lagers but when give them an Ale yeast and they seem as lost as a hairdresser with a auto-mechanic toolbox.

A decent one that I would consider buying again. Very different.
Suddabys Brother Anthonys Rievaulx Ale;Malton, North Yorkshire, England;Flavored - Other;Suddabys;[500ml bottle, The Bottle, York] Dull coppery golden colour with a thin lacing. Sweet aroma something like cream soda. Contains lavender and lemon balm – they are both faintly evident in the sweet floral notes on the palate, but there’s a reasonable malt component in there as well. Love what they tried to do here, but for me it doesn’t quite work – too much unbalanced sweet floral tackiness for me [30102008]

Interesting earthy taste. Weird but good and damn refreshing.

Poured pale amber with a small frothy off-white head. Very odd aroma - light dried wildflowers, canola grain and something that seemed a bit like plastic - not awful, but strange. The taste was very nice - dry and floral, almost pungently so, definitely fragrant wildflowers, with light bitterness in the finish. The body was appropriately light, mildly astringent, crisp and quick finishing , with a bit of a pungent pollen aftertaste. Unusual, refreshing, pretty decent. Thanks, monkey-man!

Rivertowne 2 a Day Dunkel Weizen;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Rivertowne Brewing;Mild weizen aroma and bouquet. Brown hazy appearance.

Well mannered and delicious. Enjoyability improves during the session. Overall a just plain old good example of what beer should be as far as dunkleweizen goes.

Strecks Weizen Naturtrüb;Ostheim v. d. Rhön, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Privatbrauerei Streck-Bräu;It’s unclear, orange-golden with a huge, creamy head. The aroma has notes of banana, light raspberries, wheat and light yeast. The sweet flavour has notes of banana, raspberries (mostly in the beginning), butter, wheat and you almost do not find the yeast. The overall impression is somewhat thin, and the raspberries spoils the flavour for me.

Sweet and distinctively banana-fruity aroma with a slightly milky wheat character and restrained spicy notes. Moderately sweet flavour, light bodied with a sparkling mouthfeel. Wheaty and banana-fruity taste with hints of vanilla towards the fruity finish. An easy-going and rather undemanding Weizen, nevertheless clean and pleasant to dink.15.IV.10

Rivertowne Ripple Dog Red;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;Sampled on draft this beer poured a red-amber color with a tan head. The aroma was light sweet and fruity. The flavor was lightly tangy, nutty and fruity. Uninspired but decent.
Rivertowne Ripple Dog Red;Monroeville, Pennsylvania, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Rivertowne Brewing;On tap at the Pour House. Hazy amber, off white head. Aroma is too faint to detect, but maybe...malt? Flavor is malt, caramel, toffee. Too delicate.

Slight red hue but mostly brown. Froth for a head. A rather mild malty taste. Very little hapless bitterness. Hardly any carbonation. A decent enjoyable flavor. Slight malt bitterness on the back of the throat that hangs for a while.
Ichinokura Himezen Koshu Sake;Ohzaki-shi, MIYAGI Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Koshu;Ichinokura Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Pouring at Morimoto. I did the Morimoto flight, my wife opted for this one. Pours clear. Very floral, rice fruit and strawberry. Sweet, almost oily smooth. Soft warmth, lovely sweetness. Gentle banana and fruit on the finish.
Ichinokura Himezen Koshu Sake;Ohzaki-shi, MIYAGI Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Koshu;Ichinokura Shuzo Co., Ltd.;Bottled. Very dry, plain aroma,some rice, no sweetness all. I got worried that this wasn’t actually a koshu. Boy was I wrong. Flavor starts off dry but quickly introduces a wonderfully fruity sweetness, more melon and orange than any beer could ever offer, with no oxidation at all, despite its being aged. The flavor in this is really quite delicious with lots of complexity and awesome fruits. Lovely.
Ichinokura Himezen Koshu Sake;Ohzaki-shi, MIYAGI Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Koshu;Ichinokura Shuzo Co., Ltd.;This is hands down the BEST sake I have had to date. The aroma is sweet with light fruit and just a hint of rice and alcohol. The Appearance is clear and still. The flavor is more like a desert wine than a sake but has enough rice to remind you what it is. The palate is thin but smooth. Overall this gets my highest recommendation for a sake but it is pricey.
Ichinokura Himezen Koshu Sake;Ohzaki-shi, MIYAGI Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Koshu;Ichinokura Shuzo Co., Ltd.;"Enjoyed at ""15 East"" in NYC. An aged dessert sake, this was quite yellow in color and had both marked sweetness and some sourness as well. It was like a glass of white dessert wine. Lots of complexity - I won’t bore you by naming all sorts of obscure fruits that I pretended to taste. This was a terrifically enjoyable koshu for those who don’t like the excessive sweetness of a Poochi Poochi or Moon Rabbit sparkling dessert sake."
Shichken 3-Year Aged Koshu Sake;Japan;Saké - Koshu;Shichken Shuzo Co., Ltd.;For $35 a glass, I was expecting something less harsh. It was really yellow, which is to be expected for a koshu, but it had little aroma other than rubbing alcohol, and the flavor profile was of ethanol and metal. A massive bummer.
Shichken 10-Year Aged Koshu Daiginjo Sake;Japan;Saké - Koshu;Shichken Shuzo Co., Ltd.;It’s not every day you drop $45 on a glass of koshu sake, but this was a fun adventure. The ten-year aging (cypress casks?) imparted a cotton-candy aroma and a light yellow color that was perhaps a bit woody. The flavor had plenty of alcohol - I’d guess it was about 18% and left me buzzing hard till the sushi arrived to save the day. Good, but not fabulous. I think I still prefer NamaSake.

Lecker Draft Wine;Capivari (SP), Brazil;Flavored - Fruit;WorldBev;Pours a fluro red with a pink head. Aroma is basically bad cheap red wine. Taste is a very carbinated red wine. Extremely sweet. Apparently there is beer in this as well but I can’t taste it. As far as I’m concerned less a beer, more a wine. Avoid!
Lecker Draft Wine;Capivari (SP), Brazil;Flavored - Fruit;WorldBev;Canned. Wine color with a thin cream and quickly disappear. Aroma is like wine and also the flavor, like a Dry WIne, no beer here.

Hallertau Strawberry Wheat;Riverhead, New Zealand;Flavored - Fruit;Hallertau Brewbar & Restaurant;Acidic strawberry aroma. Cloudy gold colour with big white head that dissapeared quickly.

Otokoyama (Mans Mountain) Sasaori Nama Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Asahikawa-shi , Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Otokoyama Shuzo Co., Ltd.;This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a medium sized head of finely sized clear colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent uncarbonated black colored body. The aroma was very mildly vinous. The vinous mouth feel was strongly vinous at the start and even stronger in the finish. The mild flavor contained notes of mild vinous rice wine sake. A decent one that I would consider buying again.
Otokoyama (Mans Mountain) Sasaori Nama Tokubetsu Junmai Sake;Asahikawa-shi , Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan;Saké - Namasaké;Otokoyama Shuzo Co., Ltd.;So incredibly disappointing - tasted like jet fuel. Harsh aroma and flavor of alcohol. And I LOVE namasakes - their delicate flavor, their lower than usual alcohol. Mans Mountain Nama had NONE of those qualities. Avoid. $25 for a 300ml drain pour.

Light bready malts, a bit of honey, fresh paper and newly cut wood. There’s soft pils malts too. All quite subdued and light, but no off notes. Soft grassy hops with a touch of kiwi (haha), and light creamy oats in the finish. Over light sweet and light bitter. Over light bodied with crisp lager feel. Decent but very bland.
Steinlager Pure;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);0.5l can. Clear golden color with solid white head. Aroma of grain, bread, corn, buttery biscuit and some herbs. Taste is sweet, but not offensive, and little bitter. Interesting stuff.
Steinlager Pure;Auckland, New Zealand;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Lion Breweries - NZ (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I struggle to differentiate Pure from standard Steinlager.

Aroma of sweet malt, light fruits, brown sugar, apple juice. Flavor is also juice-like with some cinnamon spices. Not what I was expecting from a barleywine, not that it was terrible.

Just slightly darker that the ubiquitous pale yellow lager. Sweet powerful aroma. You know this is gonna deliver a taste bud kick. No head. Alky is well hidden in the initial taste. Bitter alky flavors begin to rise but it never gets over the top. has an interesting fruit back drop. Finish is medium length and alky bitterness. Much better than most barlywines. Almost acceptable for a style I don’t care much for.
Big Horn Clockwork Pale;Lakewood, Washington, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Big Horn Brewing Company (Ram International);A beer with orange in it. haha. The fruit is hardly noticeable in the flavor, mostly because the bittering hops drown it out. The head disappears too quickly.
Pyramid Imperial Hefeweizen;Seattle, Washington, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecería Costa Rica - FIFCO);1 Pint Bottle 2007 Brewer’s Reserve Appearance- Pours Very Cloudy golden yellow with a large white bubble head. Some sediment from the bottle gout in to the Glass No lacing on the glass. Aroma- Very sweet smell with a floral bouquet with a hint of fruit T/P- Starts off very wheaty turning to a nice warm feeling which is more than likely due to the alcohol content of the beer. Defiantly has the taste of American wheat which I like, but if you do not and are looking for the strong banana and clove taste stay away from this one, they are there but barely Overall- Not a bad hefeweizen but at the price not one that I would drink all the time.

BrewDog Hardcore IPA (9%);Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;BrewDog;Review from notes - one of my first double ipas and one of my favourite back then with decent amount of bitterness, good drinkability and an overall feeling of drinking something different than I used to. With time I think it was a decent, but not amazing dipa.
BrewDog Hardcore IPA (9%);Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;BrewDog;Wow. That was not that I was expected. Last batch, the best that I have ever tasted. Really caramelly for first, huge body with a realy huge amount of bitterness at the end.
BrewDog Hardcore IPA (9%);Ellon, Aberdeenshire, Scotland;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;BrewDog;"Bottle. Amber Gold in colour. Hoppy aroma. Very, very hoppy; very piney oily resinous hops. Very fruity; bitter grapefruit and lemon citrus, citrus peel. Malty base; lots of toffee, buttery caramel, toasty malts. Very bitter resinous hoppy and dry throughout. Lingering dry hoppy finish. Better beer and much better balanced than the original Hardcore IPA. Very drinkable. Lovely hoppy DIPA! (2010-01)"

Red Star Framboise: Raspberry Lambic;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Red Star Agave Grille;Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a red-amber color with a medium sized white head. The aroma was tart, tangy, sweetish, crisp and had a vague berry element. The flavor was very tangy berry with a lightly tart finish and an underlying sweetness. The finish was long with tangy berry. Interesting.
Red Star Framboise: Raspberry Lambic;Greensburg, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Red Star Agave Grille;Cloudy brownish appearance. Has a creamy white head and very nice lacing, looks very attractive. Sweet perfumy aroma that is reminiscent of many sweet fruit lambics I’ve tasted. However, I do not smell any raspberries. The initial palate is very flat, virtually no carbonation. Not as sweet as I expected, but the tartness of the raspberries is ever present. Not sure if this is really lambic as the description implies, but I certainly do not detect any plain old beer characteristics in it like fruit beers have. Sweey attractive aroma carries on thru the tasting session and seems to affect the way I taste the beer. Finish is mild and not bitter the least. A very interesting and unique taste experience. This is one of the better beers I had the pleasure of tasting at Red Star. Red Star, a nice place to taste beer!
ArteBirraia San Martino;Rasai di Seren del Grappa (BL), Italy;Flavored - Other;ArteBirraia;Kratzig-gemüseartiger Antrunk mit leichter Herbe, der Hintergrund ist wässrig gehalten.

ArteBirraia San Martino;Rasai di Seren del Grappa (BL), Italy;Flavored - Other;ArteBirraia;A fruity blonde ale that smells a bit too much of cooked vegetables and not quite enough of chestnuts (contains 20 % of those). Hazy (had only 24 hours to settle) lemon yellow with little head. Medium body, low bitterness. Bottle 75 cl, BB 04 2011.
ArteBirraia San Martino;Rasai di Seren del Grappa (BL), Italy;Flavored - Other;ArteBirraia;Birra ammostata con Marroni di Rasai [Brewed with Chestnuts from Rasai] Hazy golden color. Good malt aroma, and maybe the chestnuts, interesting. The mouthfeel is not very strong, with light malt. Correct bitterness. Not bad, but the flavor needs more work.
Takao Litchi Beer;Kaohsiung, Taiwan;Flavored - Fruit;Takao Brewery;Bottle at ccParty 2007 in Taipei. Pours reddish with a moderate reddish-white head. Aroma is, as promised, of lychee, with a hint of lager malt in the background. Flavor is the same. Quite well done, I think: the fruit flavor is slightly sweet but tart enough to keep from being cloying, and the beer flavor is present enough to keep this from being alcoholic fruit juice.
BABB Teobroma;Manerbio (BS), Italy;Stout - Imperial;BABB Birrificio Artigianale Bassa Bresciana;Yuck, this does not deserve accolades for its bottling surviving skills. A slick-looking, almost black beer wearing a fine tan crown. Immediately repelling nose with cherry notes, but dominated by vinegar, dead leaves, jolly rancher candies. Very sweet on the palate yet clearly infected. The chocolate appears as but a powdery cocoa notion, vague and harmless, annihilated by the acidity. Light-medium bodied, loose texture.

Flat Branch’s website shows different descriptions for this and the ""Golden Pilsner,"" so here it goes. Lighter color than a standard pils, but that may be from the tall thin sampler. Thin clingy head. Nice Boho hop smell. Taste shows some biscuity malt and hop sharpness. A little thin, but still pleasant."

Van Pur Blonde;Warsaw, Poland;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Van Pur S.A.;[can from Villard de Lans] Floral hoppy and sweet malty aroma, if a bit weak. Bright gold liquid under a white blanket that rapidly drops to a ring. Clean malty taste that’s not quite crisp, but clean. The bitterness is not dominating, but there is something unpleasant about it. Perhaps the beer is just a bit too sweet and needs more carbonation to be in better balance. Nothing spectacular, but not bad for such a mild lager. Light body, medium carbonation, clean finish.
Kinsale 1703;Kinsale, County Cork, Ireland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Kinsale;A bottle conditioned pilsener! Golden and very almost clear with a short lived head. Pretty heavy sediment.

Apollo Sommerbryg;Copenhagen, Denmark;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bryggeriet Apollo;(On tap) An almost clear, pale golden beer with a fairly nice, retentive, rich, white head. Typical Apollo aroma - whatever that means... Medium-bodied, lightly sweet and rather fresh and fruity. I believe I can detect some pear accents? Very subdued in its bitterness which really suits the beer well, and really would suit the raw Apollo beers in general. Not a bad try on a summer quencher. 090807
Apollo Sommerbryg;Copenhagen, Denmark;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Bryggeriet Apollo;250ml draught at the brewpub in Copenhagen. Thin, but lasting white head over a pale golden body.

A small off white head that doesn’t last long. Aroma is roasted malt with some fruity hops. There is some striking bitterness that greets the first sip. They are grapefruit bitter and tart. That roasted malt is underneath and works just fine with the hops. This seems like a beer that would be very nice on tap.

Attractive copper color with a thick frothy head, very effervescent. Slightly metalic on the finish. I liked it better than I thought I would, but then again, I was really in the mood for something different, and this was.
O'Malley's Irish Style Bitter;Weston, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Weston Brewing Company;This was a pretty decent beer. It poured an amber color with a decent white head. Taste was a little bitter but not too bad. This was a decent beer from Weston MO
O'Malley's Irish Style Bitter;Weston, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Weston Brewing Company;Medium-bodied. Fairly well spiced. More fruitness than I prefer from something labeled a bitter style beer. In my opinion it is quite drinkable but I do not agree with the discription of being almost an ESB which is how it was described to me at the pub.
O'Malley's Irish Style Bitter;Weston, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Weston Brewing Company;12oz. bottle (really more like 10.5). Aroma is fruity and very lightly sweet, some cotton candy, citrus and acetaldehyde. Mostly clear light-medium amber color with an absurdly massive head that took quite some time to subside, leaving stringy clumps of lacing behind. Flavor is lightly tart and dry, with a touch of toasty malt here and there, and a certain sour, metallic, bitter finish. Lightly astringent and a bit flat on the palate as most of the CO2 ventilated while the head subsided. Body is light-medium. I don’t see the point in finishing this stuff, I’m just going to go open a good beer and drink that instead.
O'Malley's Irish Style Bitter;Weston, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Weston Brewing Company;Pours a lightly hazy amber with a huge, fluffy, off-white head that takes its sweet time diminishing. The aroma is of a tart, sour funk similar to a Berliner weiss. It’s not too bad after the initial shock, but I’m guessing that this aroma isn’t intentional. Light-bodied and tart with a lingering sour finish that moves towards solid astringency at the finish. The flavor follows the nose and is sour and astringent with a light toasted malt note underneath. The bottom line: is everything these guys bottle infected? Amazingly, this one is fairly interesting in its soured state, but the big hit of astringency that comes at the finish make it pretty much undrinkable.
Brauhaus Höchstadt Weisse;Höchstadt an der Aisch, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauhaus Höchstadt;Grobporige, passable Schaumkrone sitzt auf dem trüben hellblonden Weißbier des Brauhauses aus Höchstadt. Antrunk erfrischend, leicht zitronig-süßsäuerlich, nelkig würzig und fruchtig. Dabei mit ordentlich CO2 versehen. Weiterhin eher fruchtig und hefig im Background. Im Abgang passiert dann nicht mehr viel. Insgesamt mild und süffig, ich denke im Sommer durchaus der Hit. Wieder einmal ein fränkisches Bier, wo man vom Etikett her glaubt, es kommt aus Oberbayern.

Brauhaus Höchstadt Weisse;Höchstadt an der Aisch, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Brauhaus Höchstadt;Pineapple yellow color subtle cloudy. Smells musty-sour. Starts far too tart, subtle yeasty and absolutely unpalatable so that the freshly opened beer tastes very flat and stale. The aftertaste is again very sour and musty. In addition, fermented fruity. In the further course it’s not better. Musty tart aromas, slightly metallic, fermented fruity. One of the worst Weizen that I have ever rated!

Backstreet O'Manns Scottish Ale;Anaheim, California, United States;Scottish Ale;Backstreet Brewery;On tap in Irvine a few weeks ago. It might have been called O Mann’s Scotch Ale, but cannot remember. Poured an amber orange color with a beige head. Caramel malt aroma with some toffee and perhaps some corn? A little bit of citrus, but hardly discernible. Nice and malty with a strange adjuncty taste as well as a little smoke/roast. Nice and full bodied. A tasty beer.
McKenzie djv Barleywine;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;McKenzie Brew House;2012 bottle aged one year and purchased at Devon. Got to say I'm not a big fan if the style.... But. Pours an amber brown with maybe a half inch of head. Zero lacing. Little aroma. Mouthfeel is actually light for the style. Not too syrupy which I like. Perfect carb. Taste of cherry oak cola grass mild cough syrup smoke and coal. This was 9% abv so a little light for the style. But that really worked well. Plenty of flavor without the cloying sweetness or alcohol burn. Excellent! ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
McKenzie djv Barleywine;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;McKenzie Brew House;Bottle purchased and enjoyed at the Devon location. Definitely one of the better barleywines I’ve tasted. The beer pours a light amber color with a modest light tan head. The nose featured plenty of malt, caramel, yeast, whiskey and grassy hops. The body was full-bodied and fairly heavy. You definitely want to take your time and sip on this one. The flavors were really well-balanced and delicious. There was the perfect combination of malt and hops, as one characteristic didn’t overpower the other.

Highland Imperial Kashmir India Pale Ale;Asheville, North Carolina, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Highland Brewing Company;Rcvd in trade. The appearance has a golden amber colored body that is slightly transparent with a thin half finger white foamy head that dies immediately leaving some speckled spider web lacing clinging pretty hard to the glass. The smell has biscuit/cracker malt-like subtleties coated over top of the hops - basically combined nicely with a tropical yet slightly citrusy sort of hops. The taste is bittersweet as its nicely combined all the way throughout the entire drink. It has a bittersweet aftertaste with a dry sticky finish. On the palate, she sits about a medium, comes across semi-sessionable, and has a carbonation that is good for a DIPA as there is nothing obscure and still gives an adequate sharpness most DIPA’s give, surprisingly enough, ABV isn’t really noticed. Overall, this is a very good DIPA that I would have again.

Thick lacing remains. A sweet malty nose. This was served just a bit warm which I liked and it added authenticity. Rich malts are tasted first.

The beer is light copper with a quarter inch of white head. The aroma is alarmingly sweet, lacking the biscuit malt character that I find so delectable in this, and other English styles.

Would’ve liked some more bitterness and character from the hops, among other things. Had a waft of acetic, vinegar-like sourness that might have meant the dreaded I-word. I was left to wonder whether this place has gone downhill from student days, or if the beer was never really that good. Bummer.

Kingfisher Diet;Bangalore, India;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;United Breweries Group;This is the same as King Fisher Light, the only difference is the bottle.

That’s about it. Good beer does not exist in India. I’m not sure why they call it Light. Perhaps because it tastes more watery than the lager and has a lesser alcohol content.

Murray's Nut Brown Ale;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Brown Ale;Murrays Cerveza Artesanal;On tap. Dark amber beer with a small white head. Aroma is roasty and woody. Taste is malty, some sweetness and hazelnuts and coffee notes. Nice beer
Murray's Nut Brown Ale;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Brown Ale;Murrays Cerveza Artesanal;Draught at Cruzat, BsAs. A very complex brown ale with coffee, chocolate, tar, toasted maltiness and other dark flavours melded together. A good drinking beer with a lot of complexity for it’s ABV and yet another good Murray’s brew.
Murray's Nut Brown Ale;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Brown Ale;Murrays Cerveza Artesanal;Draught, a hazy brown with a large off-white foamy head. A light roasted malt aroma, slightly woody. A smooth malty palate, though quite hoppy with some sweet piney notes on a light mouthfeel.
Murray's Nut Brown Ale;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Brown Ale;Murrays Cerveza Artesanal;Tap at Cruzat, August 07. Clear, copper-brown color with a medium white head. Tastes of toffee, some slight coffee and chocolate notes and an acidic fruity touch. Mouthfeel is light, warming, short aftertaste. Not intrusive but not memorable either. Fruity aroma with some slight coffee and tobacco notes- Some hazelnut as well but somehow restrained. Nice, warming, approachable brown ale.
Murray's Nut Brown Ale;Buenos Aires, Argentina;Brown Ale;Murrays Cerveza Artesanal;Draft at Cruzat. Newly added as a draft at Cruzat. Strong hoppy bitterness outshines the softer, sweeter note. Overall nice and crisp.

Town Hall Ambrosia;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Vibrant Amber Color with Small White Ring. Malty Grains and Apricot Aroma. Light Notes of Belgian Yeast, Sweetness from Grains..Subtle but Continued Apricot Notes..Well Balanced with Bitter Finish. .Dry Sweet Crisp Ending. Overall a Nice Summer Beer.
Town Hall Ambrosia;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Sweet fruity beers not my thing, but this one was well hopped and more than tolerable. Great orange body, small head, wonderful lacing. Nose of sweet malts, floral hops, and sweet apricots. Taste of sweet malts, caramel, apricots, but balanced with a surprisingly good bitter hoppy finish.

Town Hall Ambrosia;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;On tap at the pub. Wheat and apricot aroma. Mostly apricot. Sweet, slightly tangy flavor. All about the apricot.
Town Hall Ambrosia;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Dense light orange pour. Straightforward nose of apricots. Clover honey brushed onto the edges. Rather singular in taste, but this works in highlighting the bare subtleties of the apricots. Suggests lavender, heather, and lemongrass. Bright and dynamic. Palate is, as expected, quite papery and synthetic. Tightly wound and milky. Malts are heavy in the finish. Very one-dimensional, but simple and successful.
Town Hall Ambrosia;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;Crisp clear dark copper color. Apricot on the otherwise grainy nose. Strong apricot body with a dry character. Smooth cereal grain finish. The grains linger on the tongue long after the apricot has faded.
Govnors Public House Full Moon White Ale;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Govnors Public House;Pale-to-mid golden with mild carbonation under a whitish head which fades rather quickly. Light florals to Belgianesque yeastiness in the aroma along with lemon/lemon cookie. Mid-bodied palate, a little more sticky than a Wit should be. Light tartness to the finish. Low diacetyl doesn’t bother me here as much as usual, hidden mostly under doughy yeasts and lemon with low honey notes. Enjoyable. From an old notebook. As Carl is the only other rater, I guess I had this last summer.
Govnors Public House Full Moon White Ale;Lake In The Hills, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Govnors Public House;This is the first offering from the brewpub’s new brewmaster. It pours a cloudy pale straw body with a modest head that reduces to a halo a bit too quickly. Nice fragrant aroma of soft wheat, coriander, and a touch of oranges. (They served me this with an orange wedge which I immediately hurled at the bartender.) This is fairly refreshing, if a bit watery. The wheat has a mild tartness to it and the coriander dominates the orange zest, but it’s blended pretty smoothly. Not bad. Govnor’s Public House,Lake In The Hills, IL
Brewzzi Honey Lager;West Palm Beach, Florida, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brewzzi Microbrewery;"Draft at WPB. Latest of their ""Brew Masters"" series. Light amber with an off white head. Strong honey nose, not much else. Satiny mouthfeel. Lots of clover honey flavor, light herbal hop. Lightly bitter finish. There is just something off about the honey, it’s not quite right, but I can’t really put a finger on it. Still, the best I had from this brewery (not saying much)."
Outer Banks Red Eye PA;Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, United States;IPA;Outer Banks Brewing Station;This has a nice red copper color but has the taste of an IPA. Its pretty bitter without the usual strong citrus qualities I find in IPAs. I would say they could add a bit more malt as the bitterness really stands out and is a bit astringent. This was part of my sampler at the OBX Brewing station. I’m guessing this is a new take on the OBX Hop Monster.
North Peak Sunset Saison;Traverse City, Michigan, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;North Peak Brewing Company;On tap: The aroma is yeasty, floral, and faintly sour. It’s a hazy dark orange with a moderate off-white head. The flavor starts lightly yeasty with some faint sourness in the middle. It finishes lightly floral with a hint of sour apple.
Plank Heller Doppelbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;Huge thanks to Erzengel for that one. Bottle looks simple but good. Beer in the glass zippy, nice head. Intense yeasty-malty aroma. Starts strong, light alcoholic, intense yeasty notes. Hints of peaches, apricot. Interesting!
Plank Heller Doppelbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;Poured from a 16.9 OZ bottle into a pint glass Aroma-Malt, floral and citrus accents Appearance- A nice murky golden amber with a small white head Taste- A nice malt flavor with that hint of floral follow through. Palate- a full bodied beer with mild carbonation that ends dry Overall- this is an excellent beer with I would definitely drink it again This is a nicely balanced sooped up Helles bock. Alcohol adds some warmth, but barely dents the high drinkability.

Plank Heller Doppelbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;500ml Bottle: Aroma of malt, caramel, bread, slight grain, and slight fruity yeast. Poured amber/copper/slight brown in color with a medium-sized tan head that diminished but lasted throughout. Cloudy. Sparkling. Full of medium and large-sized particles throughout. Flavor is medium sweet. Tastes of malt, caramel, light hops, light grain, bread, and some rye. Medium body. Dry texture. Average carbonation. Malt, caramel, bread finish is dry.
Plank Heller Doppelbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;Hellmalziger, deutlich herber Antrunk. Erst im Mittelteil ist das Bier auch hopfig, die Herbe ist aber voluminöser und toppt den Hopfen vorerst. Das lässt dieser sich aber nicht lange gefallen und holt dich die Krone im Abgang mit Hilfe der Bitterkeit zurück. Abgesehen von diesem ständigen Kampf ist eine grasige, später auch süße Note präsent, die das Bier noch aufpeppt und zu dem hellen Malz passt. Netter Doppelbock ohne Malzfixierung. 10/11/11/12/11/11
Plank Heller Doppelbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;0,5 l bottle as a gift from the brewer, thanks! The BBd was expired. Poured opalescent deep golden-amber with a small but delicious, foamy white head. Sweet caramel and fruits in the nose with some herbal hops, honey and raisins. Oily texture, fruity tastes on a caramel base, well hidden alcohol. Little bit tired beer, but fine.
Plank Heller Doppelbock;Laaber, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Doppelbock;Brauerei Plank Laaber;"My Bottom Line: Deeply bready malts float amongst heavy honeyed sweetness and alcohol warmth for an unrefined, somewhat lazy pint of Heller Bock. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam circles the hazy deep golden. There is a lot of yeast at the bottom of the bottle; beware! -This is way too sweet to be drinkable. -The mouthfeel appears lax with its flaccid sweetness and dispersed bubbles. -Faint hops are tasted throughout, obviously overcome by sweetness, while still producing some wooden bitterness in the end. Bottle."
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;On cask @ Beachwood BBQ. Deep rubt with a frothy 2 1/2 finger beige head. Lots of milk chocolate in the aroma, some light roast. Oak is a little hard to pick out other than some light vanilla. Flavor had more vanilla, oak, and roast. Not getting any smoke. Dry finish, bitterness @ a 2-3. Scant carbonation with a light to medium body. Very good beer.
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;Cask Stillage at the GBBF Earl’s Court, London 08/08/2008 Slight woody bourbon aroma. Dark red coloured strong in alcohol and smooth on the palate with a little dryness and roast flavour in a crisp and bitter whisky finish.
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;Poured from a 22oz. into an Enlightend Ale glass. Comes down black, with a nutty brown warmth. Generates a nice head and laps at the nose with hops and malt. Overtones of the Oak permeates the misty foam of the head. On the tongue it starts crisp and full, transitions into a long bitter that seems to linger through the finish. All sweetness seems to vanish during the end, and the bittery hops seem to bite sharply to cleanse the palate. If too big a sip, the bitter seems to hold, but in small doses the bitter is perfect to clear the mouth for the next taste. If you want a Hops-y Porter, this is your ticket! Hops is the predominant flavor with the oaky, nutty, chocolaty overtones taking a back seat.
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;On cask at the Daily Pint. Pours a murky brown with rising bubbles and a foamy, cask like brown head. Aroma of smoke, noticeable oak, chocolate, meat and light vanilla. Taste is rich in wood and oak over the woody chocolate barbecue that is standard with the regular smoked porter. Tons of ash too, Good. Mouthfeel is velvety and silken, cask conditioned goodness!
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;CASK at the Daily Pint. What a gang bang on the palate. Huge oak in the nose and favor. Very woody, very red and grainy. Imparts a slight vanilla, a mild sting, and smooths out the portery zing this beer carries.
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;A pint from the cask at Sea Rocket in San Diego. Black with a loose tan head that looks nice but dissipates pretty quickly without much lacing. Smells vanilla, caramel, chocolate, smoke, taste is less smoky than regular version, up front, California chardonnay style oakiness, something I usually don’t like but it works with this beer. Makes the smoke more subtle and interesting, rounds out the beer nicely. Nice smooth texture, soft carbonation, enjoyed this one quite a bit.
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;Cask (gravity) @ Great British Beer Festival, GBBF 2008, Earls Court, London, England SW5. Clear dark brown color with a virtually none appearance, fizzy, virtually none lacing, fully diminishing, beige head.

Body is medium to full, texture is oily, carbonation is flat. (080808)
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;Cask at GBBF08. Smoked whiskey aroma. Clear very dark brown colour. Small frothy light brown head. Good whiskey flavour with some vanilla. Tastes like porter with whiskey.
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;Cask at GBBF 08. Vanilla and smoke on the aroma. Some really odd fruit in mouth, like blackberry and minty blackcurrant. Tastes like the barrels had been used for cabernet sauvignon or merlot. Vanilla is there, but the rest is lovely. Light, drinkable and juicy. It’s fantastic like red wine and porter. Quite a powdery dry finish. Superb.
Stone Smoked Porter - American Oak;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;Black with tiny beige head. Sweet aroma with roasted malt, coffee and vanilla. Flavor is sweet with roasted malt, coffee, oak, vanilla, smoke and oak. Lovely.
Titletown Slippery Otter;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Titletown Brewing Company;Possibly another biased review...? I think not! It pours a nice bright, clear copper body with a plentiful white head. lots of caramel and biscuit malt in the taste. A very smooth creamy mouthfeel. Well integrated hops, and a soft fruity finish.
Titletown Slippery Otter;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Titletown Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Pours an apple juice colored amber brew with a thin creamy off-white head that quickly dissolves to a thn ring and some spotty lacing. Aroma of light bready malt, begium yeast and a touch of spice. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated, smooth, cramy with a good yeast and malt balance in flavor. Finish is slightly bitter with a semi-sweet malt and yeast flavor.
Titletown Slippery Otter;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Titletown Brewing Company;Ah, now I’m a self-described maris otter whore and this having noble hops as well? Why, it couldn’t get any better now could it? Sure, it could. That is, if the brewery who came up with this concoction decided to completely skimp on the ingredients to save a buck. Great sounding recipe, horrible execution. Zero head or lacing. Typical poor light color and watery appearance that is representative of this brewpub. Some light maris otter in the aroma and a barely discernable aroma of noble hops. It’s way WAY back in there that you’re really straining to pick it up. A light, LIGHT toffee flavour with a bit of dark roasted coffee. We’re talking LIGHT here however. Overall, the execution just killed it for me.
Titletown Slippery Otter;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Titletown Brewing Company;Malt and yeast on the nose of this brown beer. Definitly belgian yeast in the lightly spiced body.
Titletown Slippery Otter;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Titletown Brewing Company;On tap at Titletown. Poured medium caramel with a light white head and thin ring. Aroma picked up sweet caramel with a soft, spicy Belgian yeasty presence.. well-blended and seductive. Flavor was of sweet toasty caramel and some toffee sugars at the core, accented by a well-placed pepper and clove presence from the yeast.. spicy/sweet finish. Good stuff! Creamy on the palate.. sweet middle with spices emanating nicely outward.. well-balanced.
Titletown Slippery Otter;Green Bay, Wisconsin, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Titletown Brewing Company;On tap. Appearance of a clear rich burgundy-copper color with small head that quickly fades. Aroma is light belgian spice, ripe fruit, light pepper and clove. Taste is ripe fruit with a sharp contrast with the pepper and yeast flavors. A lightly toasted malt background rounds out the flavors. Full bodied and a decent amount of carbonation. Dave brings another great Belgian to the denizens of Green Bay!
Yaletown Framboise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;(Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival 2008 in Victoria, September 2008. Basalmic vinegar, good raspberry tartness. Nice berry seed. Above average. 6/3/8/3/14
Yaletown Framboise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Raspberry color, thin white head. Aroma is raspberry, light brett & ped, but it really is not that present that the description leads on. Taste is raspberry, much more sweet then sour, the sourness if increased could make it a much better beer.
Yaletown Framboise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Malt vinegar and very sweet raspberries in an aroma that is clean, fresh and appealing. Opaque, darkest ruby red body is topped by a pink tingedhead that recedes to a partial cover and ring with some patchy lacing. Plenty of wheat character and raspberries are evident but flavour is markedly sweet. There is a light underlying sourness but perhaps this needs more time to develop? Medium-light body with fair carbonation that is somewhat short-lived. I wonder if some brett would spike up the flavour, dry it out a bit and add further carbonation? Sampled on cask at The Whip.
Yaletown Framboise;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Yaletown Brewing Co.;Cask, The WhipVery purple. Winey, woody, voluptuous berry nose. Cuts loose with some sweet raspberry, light balsamic. Woody, vinegary finish but still reasonably sweet as well. Not bad, maybe seems a bit unfinished, but has an interesting fruit-vinegar dynamic that I’d love to see tested on the masses.
R & B Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Roast and cream with some nut. Not bad, and perhaps a little underrated. Pours black with good mocha head and lacing. Sharp bitter end. Oatmeal. Tap at brewery.
R & B Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Draft: Poured a deep black with a tan head. Aroma is sweet malts. Taste is soft molasses and roasted malts.
R & B Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Bottle - Light roast and some chocolate. Jet black brown with a light brown head, roasty notes again with a touch of chocolate. Not as interesting or rich as an oatmeal stout could be but OK.
R & B Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);65cl Bottle brought from Canada, thank’s H&T! Black colour, creamy beige head. Aroma of cold coffee and cream, coffee creamer, roasted malts, hint of metal. Flavour is dry, cold coffee and cream, quite milky but without the sweetness, hint of chocolate, dry bitter finish, a bit fizzy. Light-bodied, watery. Not great. Wouldn’t classify this as a sweet stout though.
R & B Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);On tap. Dark brown/ruby with no cap. Aroma of a bit of coffee, chocolate, and nuttiness. Taste is sour upfront, with sweet following. Low carbonation. Thin finish.
R & B Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Pours a very dark brown letting no light through and a big initial light brown head that quickly becomes a small ring. Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, and a coffee & cream sweetness. Flavour is moderate lactic acid, roasted malts, coffee, and mild bitterness.
R & B Dark Star Oatmeal Stout;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Stout - Milk / Sweet;R & B Brewing Company (Howe Sound);Pours a dark black with a big frothy brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves tons of lace. Aroma of sweet creamy coffee, roasted malts, vanilla and rich chocolate. Taste is coffee, chocolate, vanilla and a bit of roasted malts. Flavor and body really thins out on the finish and this great smelling beer isn?t as good on the palate.
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Keg at Pizza Port Carlsbad. Deep reddish brown, beige head. Nose is resin, toffee. Tastes toffee, resin, pine, red fruits. Good.
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);10 oz tulip on tap at Toronado. The aroma has a nice caramel and toffee sweetness present. Mostly sweet and malty. Somewhat transparent dark ruby colored body with a small to medium off white head. Starts with a caramel, sweet, chewy malt flavor. Lots of tannin notes present. Becomes a bit leathery towards the finish with some fleeting bitterness that’s a little dank. Straight forward, but good enough.
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Sour&bitter. An aroma of citrus, hops and weak caramel. A flavor of hops, citrus and sweets.
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Draught at Craft Beer Co, Clerkenwell on 30 Jun 2012. Poured a deep amber, with a dense off white head. Aroma of citrus and pine hops with some toasted malt. Toffee in the flavour, with berries and grassy hops. Finish was bitter resin, peal and caramel.
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"""Pretty nice imperial red ale. nice balance of crystal malt, nuttiness, citrus hops and some bitterness. not a wow beer but pretty solid across the board."
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Keg at PP Carlsbad, 21/04/14. Clear dark amber/chestnut brown with reddish hues and a good sized beige covering that retains well. Nose is caramel malt, pine, grapefruit, hops, candied orange peel, caramelisd sugars, light spice. Taste is caramel malt forward, bubblegum, sweet licks, red grapefruit, bitter orange. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, semi aggressive hop bitterness in the close. Decent hoppy red/strong.
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);On draft at the brewpub it is an amber color with a slight head. The aroma is malty andvthe taste is strong malty very bitter taste that resonates on the palate
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);On draft at Pizza Port Carlsbad. Pours a clear deep amber with an ecru head. Dark grain notes in the nose. Flavors of rye and grapefruit. Bitter finish.
Pizza Port 547 Haight;Carlsbad, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);January 6th, 2012 - I’d like to think Pizza Port Carlsbad’s 547 Haight is a testament to the challenge of brewing a muscular, distinctive red brew, but amongst PP’s other offerings, it didn’t offer me much to take notes on. It’s hoppy, sure and sharp in both nose and flavor, where the caramel sweetness oozes, ribbons of caramel draped over hop cones. The rich grains and sugars are a welcome push-back against a hopper edge, with an aroma not unlike a brewery on brew day - botanical, but candied. Good stuff!
Witte Madam;Oud-Turnhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Nest;"Commissioned wheat beer by Het Nest, bottle from the Prik & Tik in Zele. Thick, egg-white, moussy, large-bubbled, irregularly lacing head, clear ‘old gold’ colour with pale orangey tinge and very fierce sparkling; turns misty and more ochre-ish with sediment. Aroma of bread crust, bird seed, dry grass, gin, sweaty Gouda cheese, tulips, apple peel, a hint of ‘citroenjenever’ and lemon zest and a vague chlorine-like whiff. Sweetish onset, ripe banana, red apple and green pear, sharp and bit numbing carbonation, very fizzy; light bready and cereally middle with a wheaty sourish edge but limitedly so, lots of dusty coriander seed spiciness and a soft, floral hop bitterish touch. A strong effect of ‘jenever’-like, wry alcohol ensues. Classic ‘coriandered’ tripel, intended to be as accessible and familiar in taste as possible to a traditional Belgian audience, but the alcohol definitely should have been better masked. Bit of a downer for me, I expect more from this brewery when it comes to classic Belgian recipes."
Witte Madam;Oud-Turnhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Nest;Bottle, 8.5%. Weak citrus aroma. Hazy golden colour. Small white head. The flavour is malty and spicy. Does not taste like wit, but I guess it does not have to. Warming alcohol finish.
Witte Madam;Oud-Turnhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Nest;33 cl bottle. Pours cloudy yellow to orange with a small white head. Aroma is fruity, slight phenolic. Sweet and lingering fruity. Medium dry phenolic finish.
Witte Madam;Oud-Turnhout, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brouwerij Het Nest;KRS 091216. Golden-orange color with an off-white head. Aroma is spices, peaches, plums, oranges. Flavor is spices, peaches, plums, oranges, alcohol, fruit, berries, caramel, yeast . Medium body. Ordinary beer.
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;Bottled, 330ml from Beers of Europe, aged 5yrs. Gold with short lived head. Quite corn like flavours, sweet, quite a chemical character to it. There was a hint of joss sticks about it, quite acrid but on the flavour rather than the aroma. Not really what you would expect from a Trippel.
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;500 ml bottle (thanks for sharing, LasseG). Clear golden amber with small white head. Aroma is spicy, saffron, malt and some medical notes. Taste is sweet, saffron, spice with metallic notes.
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;500ml Bottle (Shared by Omhper,thanks) - Golden/amber with a foamy head. Grainy and sweaty aroma with a hint of apricot and a hint of a changing from for babies! Fruity and slightly tart taste with yeast,apricot and malt. Not as bad as I was told,but something clearly went wrong when they brewed this as it’s not up to Nils Oscar’s usual high standards.
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;Bottle at Akkurat, vintage 2007. Fortunately only 2000 bottles were produced, the beer was terrible! Tasted and smelled bad, saffron, bread, spices, stale. Very, very bad!
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;Vintage 2007. Cellared for about one and a half years. Golden yellow, small white head. Smells mostly of dough and saffron. Perhaps some minimal fruity notes, caramel and bready malts. The smell is really unpleasant. This is almost not drinkable, a horrible taste. Stale dough and saffron mixed with and off-centered spiciness dominate and this makes of for an awful taste. Again, some sweet fruity notes and a very gentle taste of smoke is present, but they are completely overshadowed by the awful taste of dough and saffron. The finish is slightly bitter and somewhat malty. Medium body, somewhat sticky mouthfeel. I’ve heard that this one was bad when it was fresh, and I can tell you that it has not aged with dignity. By far one of the worst beers I’ve tasted lately. Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. Serving type: bottle (Copy of old Beer Advocate review)
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;50 cL bottle. Pours clear and golden orange with a small white head. Spiced and somewhat burned plastic aroma. Sweet cornish and metallic flavoured with a light spice note. Has a vague caramel malt sweetnes but otherwise with a classic dry and mild spiced impression. Vague sweetness into the finish.
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;Bottle at Nya Tröls, Malmö. Clear golden coloured with a small white head. Fruity aroma of berries with notes of yeast, spices and burnt plastic. Fruity flavour of spices with notes of yeast and hops. Spicy and hoppy finish. Mediocre tripel. Have tasted one more bottle, where the burnt plastic were much more evident.
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;Nice amber colour. Quite sweet taste. Some smoke in the nose. Some hints of lemon in the taste. Not ver special. Tasted at Pikkulintu.
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;Bottle. This was a big disappointment. I was warned that the beer wasn’t good fresh, but supposedly better now. If that’s the truth, it shouldn’t have been sold at all. There’s a lot of grapefruity sourness in both aroma and flavor, it’s dusty, citric and not much else. A faint touch of spices struggle to be seen, and there’s a hint of hoppy bitterness in the finish. Oh, I almost forgot the medicine and burnt plastic like flavors. Had a quite small sample, but wasn’t even near finishing it. Well, at least it looked decent, with it’s hazy, golden body and a small white head. Surely gone bad, and shouldn’t be sold. (080811)
Nils Oscar Trippel;Nyköping, Sweden;Tripel;Nils Oscar;500 ml bottle. Golden body with a small white head. Aroma is sweet, spicy and medicine. Flavor is a bit of grapefruit dominated by plastic and rubber. This is not drinkable at all. Checking through the other ratings here, it seems like some are very pleased and some other agree with me. Different batches or something happening over time? I don’t think it’s possible at all to finish this bottle I tasted.
Grand River Town Hall Lager;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);Forgot this in my fridge. A nice blonde lager with a thick frothy lacing white head. In aroma, light grainy malt with light lactic notes, OK. In mouth, light lactic malt , lemony, pleasant, light mineral notes. Surprising, after 5 years, this tastes like a light lambic.
Grand River Town Hall Lager;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);Bottle. Very easy drinking. A gateway beer for those who don’t drink reall beer. Light in the mouth and the swallow.

Grand River Town Hall Lager;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);500ml bottle thanks to Boutip. Clear golden with a medium foamy white head. Good retention and great lacing. Aroma is banana syrup for kids, marshmallow strawberries, waternmelon, fizzy peach candies, citrus and malt. Flavor is very fruity, slightly less candy than the aroma. There is citrus, peach, strawberries, herbs, malt, hops and an interesting bitter finish. Thin to medium body with fine bubbles. Much better than expected, I’m impressed with this one.
Grand River Town Hall Lager;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);its a hazy yellow with a small ring of head. smells grassy, sort of metallic, and not to say it lightly but like urine. tastes light, strangely a bit like alcohol considering its percent, dull-almost bready, a tiny bit spicy, with a noticeable metallic taste. it feels flat though moderate bodied, from its packaging and the rating i expected an interesting, flavourful low percent lager but this is just too far off tasting.
Grand River Town Hall Lager;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);clear yellow, fluffy white head. Plain nose, slightly herbal, dried fruits, some citrus, soapy, bready. Bready taste as well, smooth and clean, balanced well, not an amazing beer but better than any other light lager ive tried.
Grand River Town Hall Lager;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);"Well, I gotta say, as far as ""premium lagers"" go, this and Creemore are probably the best I’ve ever had. Pours a fizzy gold yellow with no head. Aroma really grainy, big bread notes, a little bit of honey and lemon, ends on a strange note, kind of smells like an old basement. Flavour is grainey, bread, lemon zest, grass, a touch of hops and more lemon in the end. A bit of soapiness in the finish, but its actually not a bad thing....in a weird kind of way. Really good, will buy again."
Grand River Town Hall Lager;Cambridge, Ontario, Canada;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Grand River Brewing (Magnotta Brewery);Simple, but very well made. Nothing exciting, just a solid balanced, well made thirst quenching lager. Good stuff.
McKenzie Malvern Mild;Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;McKenzie Brew House;Cloudy amber-brown with a small head. Aroma is malty with a heavy dose of sawdust. Taste is malty, but bland – not very exciting and served way too cold to get much out of it. Why didn’t I just have a second Barleywine?

John Harvards Export Lager;Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;John Harvards Brewhouse Monroeville;On tap at the Monroeville location. Ubiquitous pale yellow american lager color and appearance. Clean aroma, barely any there. Has a pilsner impact on the taste buds. Smooth lager flavors at first. Mild bitterness building on the back of the palate. barely any carbonation. Comes on rather friendly then manifests itself as a more oppressive bitter finish.

Mad Brewer Divine Intervention;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle from old notes. Pours a clear amber brown color with a small, dense beige head. The aroma and flavor have big sweet caramel, toffee, ripe fruits, raisins, apricots, brown sugar, vanilla, a touch of citrus and resin, shows the abv a bit, but I don’t mind that, the bottle was not super fresh so it was probably more hoppy at one time, solid brew nonetheless. I know it’s retired, but I’m working through backlog.
Mad Brewer Divine Intervention;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle thanks to somebody, rating from my backlog.

Mad Brewer Divine Intervention;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle shared at a recent BA/RB tasting... Poured amber with an off-white head. A little oxidized with a tea leaf quality that was well welcomed and some dark malt sweet tones.
Mad Brewer Divine Intervention;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;650 ml bottle This was a disappointment even though I set the bar low after a number of experiences with Mad Brewer. It is no shock to learn that they closed over the summer. While any brewery closing is not good news in this case the market was just too crowded to support a subpar product. Maybe they can reopen in the future after some quality control. Aroma / Appearance - Chewy brown and fluid the body has a hefty presence. Dusty cherry pie blends with the smell of a rare bookshop to form a musty hoppy profile. This seems to have mellowed since I picked it up two years ago. Flavor / Palate - Cherry pie filling sweetens the throat like a gourmet candy bar. There’s little depth to back it up despite some hoppiness that kicks back. It has shadows of promise but this bottle at least falls short of what I expect in a barleywine. This is probably going to be the last beer I pick up from Mad Brewer as I am almost certain the rest on the shelves will have fared much worse.
Mad Brewer Divine Intervention;North Ridgeville, Ohio, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;The Brew Keeper / Mad Brewer;Bottle thanks to Bu11zeye.

Millys Tavern Dubbel Barrel;Manchester, New Hampshire, United States;Dubbel;Millys Tavern / Stark Brewing Company;Clearish copper coloured ale with a light white cover. Rather one-dimensional ale that is clearly intended for oak lovers as the barrel has pretty much eaten whatever was beery about it. Huge oak aroma with strong, strong minty notes. Wildly woody and growing alcoholic on the way. Not too sure of the purpose or direction, but it does feel a bit tart and whiskey-like.

John Harvards Apis Mellifera Brown Ale;Lakegrove, New York, United States;Brown Ale;John Harvards Brewhouse Lake Grove;Pint pour @ brewpub. Color is generic clear brown. Taste is orange citrus hops and a young/green maltiness with some light cereal-grain sweetness. Taste is bittered and spiky hops and really not much else to talk about. Despite being a brown ale and using honey this just comes out as a generic amber ale that happens to be darker. Boring.

General Lafayette Hop-eweizen;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Copper Crow Beer Company;Tap @ General Lafayette. Poured a hazy dark yellow color with a small off-white head. The aroma was malty with a mildly wheaty character. Some mild banana notes were mixed in. The flavor was a mix of bananas and malt. Then came huge hops. Spices, pepper, and bitterness then started and kepted growing up through a dry finish. Medium bodied.
General Lafayette Hop-eweizen;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Copper Crow Beer Company;Pours a hazy golden orange with a smaller bubbly white head. Aroma of banana, bready, citrus, clove, hints of caramel and touches of floral. Flavor of the standard banana, clove, wheat malt and Hefe usuals. A touch of hop flavor and bitterness but name does not match the flavors/aroma. Expected more hops to overpower the Hefe character.
General Lafayette Hop-eweizen;Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Copper Crow Beer Company;"Golden color with a bubbly white head. Aroma dominated by citrus, coriander, yeast, and bread. Taste is primarily of lemony-citrus, coriander, and yeast with a pleasant hop bite at the end. Pretty good and refreshing. Hops aren’t overdone like some other ""non-hopped up"" styles that end up messy during experimentation. Just a tasty sipper."

Brewsters Kölsch;Calgary, Alberta, Canada;Kölsch / Kölsch-Style;Brewsters Brewing Company - Alberta;Review from early summer, 2009. Typical pour with no head. Light gold brew, crystal clear. Mild fruit, apricot, grains - smells ok. The taste was pretty mild and not one that i am fond of, so I can consider this my last pint. Some fruit and the grains and malts come across a bit strong. Finishes clean. I think I did not let this warm up enough.

Uncle Billys Insomniac Espresso Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;Rated in 2010 (Backlog) - Black in color with a decent sized beige head. Aroma is of espresso. Taste is of roasted malts, light smoke and espresso.

Uncle Billys Insomniac Espresso Stout;Austin, Texas, United States;Stout;Uncle Billys Brewery & Smokehouse;Tap at UB’s. I love this beer and make an effort to get it whenever it’s available. This particular batch apparently sat on coffee beans for 5 days instead of the normal 2, so it’s extra-coffee’d. It’s black in the glass with a nice foamy head in a rich medium-brown. The nose is very heavy on the espresso, along with caramel and toasted malt tones. The flavor opens with a punch of woody, rich espresso, balanced by a nice sweet malt backbone. The really nice thing about this beer is that the coffee smells and tastes really fresh - I’ve encountered other beers, most particularly Beer Geek Breakfast, that just smell like old used coffee beans. No doubt in my mind that this is a coffee lover’s beer, and I love me some coffee. I’ll happily say that this is the best coffee stout I’ve had. It’s also one of the best beers produced in Austin, so you should definitely check and see if it’s available when you’re there. As a side note, I wouldn’t call it a summer seasonal - it’s available whenever UB’s fits it into their special tap schedule, which is probably about once every 2 months or so.

Kings Premium;Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Boliarka-VT Brewery;500ml bottle, shared at the Euston Tap on 15 January 2011. Many thanks to Leighton for bringing this back from Bulgaria. Pale yellow colour. Skunky boiled vegetable and paper in the aroma. Primarily more cardboard on the palate. Maybe a touch of cereal.

Dodging Duck Milk & Quackers Milk Chocolate Nitro Stout;Boerne, Texas, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Dodging Duck Brewhaus;"FROM MY MAGAZINE COLUMN: ""BREWHOUSE BULLETIN"" (HILL COUNTRY DIRECTIONS SEPT/OCT 2007): ‘Milk & Quackers’ Milk Chocolate Nitro Stout The Dodging Duck Brewhaus – Boerne, TX For a stout fan, this beer is fun from start to finish: watching it pour slow from the nitrogen tap, that first sip through the creamy head, holding it to the light to see that none passes through the tar darkness, the bold aroma of chocolate as it warms. Take in the mind-boggling smoothness. It pours dense brownish black, topped with super-small, super-tight bubbled (almost whipped) rich chocolate milk colored head. As the beer level drops, it leaves a nice milky foam wall inside the glass, which slowly settles until the next sip. After 5 years of making different dry stouts, this is brewer Keith Moore’s first venture into the realm of the sweet stout. ‘Milk & Quackers’ is not overwhelmingly sweet as the name might suggest, but it’s certainly not bone dry. Its sweetness due, in large part, to lactose powder (‘milk sugar’) added towards the end of the boil. It’s subtle, coming off with the aroma and beginning taste of roasted chocolate malt. The brew finishes chalky and tangy, blunt and bitter. Like sucking on a square of Baker’s chocolate. The mild hops linger and play dark on the palette. Moore describes the mouthfeel as “almost crunchy!” This beer is rich, but doesn’t sit heavy on the gut. At 5% ABV, it’s extremely drinkable and made even more enjoyable paired with the restaurant’s bison burger or beef tenderloin medallions. For desert, a pint stands alone or compliments a slice of apple pie and ice cream. If you’re not lucky enough to catch ‘Milk & Quackers’ on tap, try the seasonal ‘Ducktoberfest.’ Moore’s recipe sticks to tradition, using the same ingredients the Germans use. Dark orange in color, it’s more malty than your regular lager. With a caramel taste that’s almost chewy."

This beer pours a small beige head that is fully lasting, transparent amber body, fizzy, fast rising carbonation, and a good amount of lacing. The aroma is malt and pine hops. The flavor is malt, lightly bitter, pine, and citrus hops. The mouthfeel of this beer is smooth and this beer is medium bodied. All-in-all, this beer has a mild lingering hoppy aftertaste and is worth trying.
Goose Island Harvest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Transfer from BA review on 9-8-13- Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours a nice deep amber-copper color with a huge foamy cream colored head. The head has a decent level of retention, slowly fading to leave a nice level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma is heaviest of a sweet caramel and a bit of toffee as well as some fruit smells of apple and a decent roasted malt smell. Along with these sweeter and maltier aromas is a moderately strong hop smell of a citrus and floral nature. Taste – The taste begins with caramel sweetness and a nice roasted malt and biscuit taste. As the flavor advances, the taste sweetens as toffee and apple tastes come to the tongue. Along with these sweeter flavors coming to the tongue, the roasted flavors dwindle, further enhancing the sweeter flavors. While the sweeter is enhanced, it is kept in check/balance by a lightly hoppy taste of a citrus and herbal nature, in the end leaving a very pleasantly balanced bitter-sweet flavor on the tongue. Mouthfeel –The body of the beer is on the medium side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that was on the average side as well. Both were rather appropriate for the style batching both the sweet and bitter hop flavors nicely. Overall –Some roast, some sweet and some hop all melding very nicely. A rather enjoyable ESB.
Goose Island Harvest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);The body has a rich hazy amber color with some nice visible carbonation and a light beige head on top. This head is about two fingers tall at the end of the pour and fades slowly making some nice lace patterns on the way down the glass. The aroma has some herbal/earthy/leafy hops up first with some mellow fruity/estery and light caramel like malty sweetness in the background. The flavor reflects this with a great balance or mix of bready, yeasty and fruity (apricot/peach notes) maltiness with herbal and slightly citrusy floral hops. Its medium bodied and smoothly textured with a well blended mild finish.
Goose Island Harvest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Clear, amber color. Fair amount of bitterness, some caramel and toffee notes. Some lingering bitterness.
Goose Island Harvest Ale;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Goose Island Beer Company (AB-InBev);Reviewed from notes. The appearance had an amber colored body that leaves a beautiful soft foamy yet lumpy two finger white head that lasts for at least a good two minutes. Beautiful nice lacing appears and clings nicely to the sides of the pint glass. The body is slightly hazy yet no carbonation is rising. The smell had a slightly bland but herbal with some hops here and there, a bit of breadiness comes out in a toasty sort of way. The taste had a soft biscuit-ness with a caramel kind of maltiness, interesting (it is an ESB, though). On the palate, she sat at medium with a nice feel on the tongue, perhaps, close to perfect. Overall, this turned out better than I thought, I’d have this again.

Slightly hazy amber-orange body, thin-medium tight buff head. Toasty nose with light sweetness and earthy hops. Hoppy body, spicy and floral, backed by bready, toasty malt with light sweetness.

Tomio Hanaichirin Junmai Daiginjo Sake;Kyoto, Japan;Saké - Daiginjo;Kitagawa Honke;Served chilled. I concur with puzzl on the bottle. Its really unique and attractive, though my bottle was yellow, not blue. The sake shows a clear body, with subtle hints of faint yellowish hues. Thick legs coat the glass when you swirl the liquid. The aroma is floral, with koji, hints of melon, and a calming, smooth creaminess. The flavor is complex and very pleasing. I picked up drying rice, cream, melon, limoncello, and even subtle hints of cinnamon. The lemony alcohol adds significant heat on the finish, but its not obtrusive in any way. Ample, slick and creamy mouthfeel. Perfectly balanced sweetness. Awesome sake. I will be seeking out more of this.

Triangle shaped, with a gentle 45 degree twist towards the top. I normally don’t care about bottles but this is beautiful. Aroma of a sweet honey nectar, koji and a touch of black beans. Very subtle but still deep and complex. Dry, kind of sherry-ish taste, with nice rice and floral notes. More honey, perhaps a rich buckwheat, although again it is not at all dominant; rather a very delicate note. Little alcohol noticable. Very nice as it warms. Strikes a perfect balance between dry and sweet, and is also quite savory. Herbaceous, perhaps. Very good."

The aroma has notes of charred astrengent and chocolate malt, oak and vanilla bean, phenolic booze, prune, fig, anise and a leathery yeast profile. The taste is twangy fruits, palate biting alcohol, sweet malts and woody spiced finish. Rounded for the most part and incrediable dpeth of palate. The mouth feel is sticky and full-bodied, heavy and aggressive. A wonderful brew that sadly needs to be retired now... maybe Bells wants to do a ""pooh"" version ;-)"
Bell's Bourbon Barrel Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;For rating 2700, sampled at GTMW ’08 from large Magnum bottle and shared by the Bells volunteers. Pours an opaque near black, syrupy brew with no head but some fine film swirls on top. Aroma of vanilla, dark chocolate, bourbon, some charred oak, dark raisins and a touch of coffee. Taste is full bodied, thick, no carbonation, with flavors of bourbon, dark chocolate, caramel, raisins and a touch of vanilla. Finish is just as thick and chewy as its flavor with a nice dark chocolate and bourbon aftertaste that lingers long after the finish. The brew was so thick it required nearly five water rinses to clear out my sampling glass.

Bell's Bourbon Barrel Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;On tap @ Maduro, Bells GTMW pre-party 8/10/07. Opaque black with no head at all. Strong aromas of bourbon, vanilla, toffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, light sherry, and some raisins. Flavor was the same with a good amount of bourbon, bordering on too much (like BCS), but not quite. Huzzah! I’ve found a new BA beer that has a buttload of bourbon but I still enjoy. Loads of chewy toffee, caramel, bourbon, and vanilla in equal portions. A bit of sherry is lighter in the background. With all the aforementioned jazz, you’d think it pretty sweet, which it was, but some dry ass wood and whatever hops still in there cut it short. Toffee and bourbon linger a while in the finish. Full syrupy body with light prickly carbonation. My glass is stained with this amazing beer.

Bell's Bourbon Barrel Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;On tap at Birreria Paradiso, the night after the Bells dinner. Pours an almost darker black than the expedition, with an even deeper more foamy orange head and better lacing! Aroma is way more intense, but not neccesarily better- tons of licorice, sharp black chocolate- tons of burnt black patent malts, nutty, light smoke, and bourbon is a bit sharper. Tons of sugary sweetness, and chocolate with hints of coffee, tons of licorice, tar, chewing tobacco, sharp bourbon, some green young hints that I get in the regular expedion new batches, and fairly bitter despite the sweet middle. A bit harsh and over the top , bourbon makes it seem even stronger than it is and is still very sweet, and not as mellow as the regular 7000- This reminded me a lot more of a Darklord. Pretty damn nice, but not quite as good as the BA expedition/double cream IMO.
Bell's Bourbon Barrel Batch 7000 Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bell's Brewery;Imperial stout rating #150. First thing noticed other than a silky dark brown head on a near-pitch black body was a distinct soy note, that had me worried, but it was rather low key and later on in the drink it disappeared, so probably just a result of the slightly too-cool temperature this was initially served at. First taste is rich and decadent buttery mocha and bourbon, extremely heavy and thick on the tongue, with a chocolate residue, so smooth and creamy, with some lighter notes of char and soy. The intensity rises over the back of the palate into a striking finish, complete with sharp bourbon, soothing chocolate and butter, so rich and decadent, creamy like fudge with just a really wonderful bourbon note, not harsh or dry at all, very vivid and alive on the palate. The high alcohol of the 7000 works much better with the bourbon barrels than does the Double Cream/Expedition blend, and at a warmer temperature there was such a serious bourbon note emanating from my glass, it was about as perfect of a winter warmer as you could ask for, relieving and relaxing you from the below freezing temperatures outside. Overall it’s an amazing beer. I was surprised it was so nice, since I wasn’t much of a fan of Batch 7000 (had 4-5 bottles no older than 9 months, which would explain the difference now). Seriously deserving of high praise.

Pours a very dark, murky and oily brownish color; thin, fine-bubbled head with more oiliness than lacing. Very dense, buttery bourbon and dark chocolate and an impressively soft, toasty vanilla-tinged oak and intricate bourbon character in the aroma; just lovely. Exceptionally oily, dense mouthfeel: all the roastiness and oily, nuttiness of the non-BA version, with a soft, buttery bourbon character; plenty of vanilla and warming alcohol, but nothing harsh; creamy, dense, excellent bourbon throughout, without overwhelming the beer underneath. Medium, soft bourbon and chocolate and roasted nuts in the finish; oily and smooth."

Inky black; tepid grey foam in a thin lining. Sherry, sour mash bourbon and the seared crust of creme brulee in the aroma; subtely oxidized and wooded with hints of soy sauce and some charred dark fruit. Shades of pepper and port linger near the bottom of the what actually may be characterized as a truly bottomless montage. Rich, bold, and refined, with a really thick meaty quality throughout; late suggestions of grahams and caramelized sugars, blonde brownies. Taste first presents the subtle colors of bourbon in vanilla and toasted oak; cherry cola and plenty of bright, sharp sweetness in burnt honey, hickory, peppermint and eggnog. These tones are slightly lactic and not as dark as the typical sugars of imperial stout, though the residual foundation itself is as black and chocolatey as ever could be. Softly carbonated, oily, and fully decadent mouthfeel; viscous, deep, and tightly balanced. Finishes with a type of drying alcoholic heat that suggests vanilla-tinted vodka, remaining quite sweet. Syrupy and a bit tangy in its final pulse; striking gold with the elusive success of bourbon integration in its both careful and brash disposition. Incredible; memorable."
Scotch Irish Summit Pale Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;"Cask. At 2007 Fort York TFOB. Poured cloudy orange with a wispy off-white head. I really - REALLY - dug this aroma; fresh pungent green hops, almost like just-crushed mint leaves, with a lightly grainy sweet malt pushed way into the background. The taste, well, it was pretty jagged - I confess I made a face - just a gobsmash of raw green hops, it seemed a bit soapy and acidic to me, really not balanced or blended at all - interesting, but a chore to finish my double sample. Pretty decent body - that much hop presence made it seem thick - as I said very astringent, even acidic bitter mouthfeel, long, long bitter finish and aftertaste. Kudos on that fresh hop aroma, but it proved a little harsh, almost like it waren’t quite ready; interesting."
Scotch Irish Summit Pale Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;[494-20070810] Cask @ TFOB (Toronto, ON). Lemon citrus hops aroma. Hazy, red brown body with a medium-lasting bubbly off-white head. Lemon peel hops continues in flavour, not too bitter. Medium-full body. Nice hoppy beer.
Scotch Irish Summit Pale Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;Cask at TFOB 2007. Pours a hazy dark orange with a spare diminishing off-white head. Very nice aroma, quite fruity, a little spicy and very hoppy. Flavour: Hmmm, It’s either a little boozy or the hops (of which there are LOTS) aren’t properly balanced or something making it somewhat harsh -- I can drink it but I’m not sure I’d want to. Perhaps the beer is not quite ready yet? I don’t know. Average cask-like body. A nice attempt at an IIPA (it might be called a Pale Ale but it’s not what he was going for), it’s just not quite there yet. I’d love to try a less raw version in the future though.
Scotch Irish Summit Pale Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;cask at beer fest. amber color, lotsa hops, good citrus notes i agree with greg that there is some resin, decent malt . bitter finish
Scotch Irish Summit Pale Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;Cask sample at TFOB 2007. Hazy orange-amber with a still body. Big-ass Summit hops in the body - lots of orange/tangerine notes, with some resin and grass. Soft mouthfeel. Hops are a bit harsh in the flavour, but there’s enough malt to keep them from getting too out of hand. I think this could’ve done with another week or so in the cask before being served, but it was still pretty nice.
Scotch Irish Summit Pale Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Kichesippi Beer Company;TFOB 2007 Cask. Sampled on the Friday afternoon. Hazy dark amber-brown body with a small frothy beige head. (3+) Huge hoppy aroma is very green and leafy, with moderate resin and very light grassy notes. (8+) Fairly bitter with a mouth drying hop character, bit of green leafiness, light citrus hints and resin in the flavour, malt is there balancing things but is still overshadowed by the hops. Average palate for a cask. Pretty cool, and surprisingly drinkable - I went back for more. 8/3/7-8/3/16+
Scotch Irish Mental Bob Old Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Old Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Cask. At 2007 Fort York TFOB. Another big hats off to Perry for trying something new, bold and memorable. and successful, too - like Greg, this was hands-down the hit of the festival for me - although the already familiary Black Oak Summer Saison was damned good too. Poured a deep hazy cola colour, with an average-sized frothy beige head. Rich aroma of raisins, chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel and pungent green hops. The taste followed right on, but was MUCH more bitter than I was expecting, those green hops warred with the fruit/roast malt for my attention, perhaps not smooth, but balanced, sort of reminiscent of Detente. The mouthfeel was very thick, almost chew and sugary (liquid oatmeal!), syrupy and a bit flat (cask - duh), with a bitter, carbonized linger to it Really good, another big malty treat from SI!
Scotch Irish Mental Bob Old Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Old Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;[497-20070810] Cask @ TFOB (Toronto, ON). Sweet spruce resin and some sweet dates in the aroma, light chocolate background. Hazy, very dark brown red body. Sweet raisin fruit malt flavour, the alcohol comes out more as it warms. Thick full body. Would prefer less sweet.

Aroma of alcohol (whiskey?), caramel malt, brown sugar, light hops and dark fruit. Flavour follows with caramel malt, brown sugar, wood and dark fruit -- sweet and just a little boozy. Average bodied. Pretty good, a nice version of the style.
Scotch Irish Mental Bob Old Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Old Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;Cask sample at TFOB 2007. Deep brown with a small head. Aroma of dark fruit, coffee, chocolate, malt, and lurking in the background, piney hops. Full, rich flavour of deep roasted malt, chocolate, raisins and a hint of molasses, with a healthy hit of hops in the finish. Highlight of the Festival for me.
Scotch Irish Mental Bob Old Ale;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Old Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;TFOB 2007. Cask. Dark brown body with a small foamy beige head. (3+) First impression of the aroma is of grass, but it does not seem to come back so I decide to attribute it to the fact that I am sitting on the ground, rather than the beer. Aroma includes notes of dark fruit and malt, and is a bit more muted than I would have expected. It opens up a bit more as it warms, yielding hints of spruce and to a lesser extent pine. (7+) Sweet flavour with lots of malt, raisins and dark fruit, caramel malt and a light to moderate bitterness balancing it all. Average palate is rather full for a cask, pleasingly so. (3+) This is actually quite good. I would love to try this on draught or even better - bottle conditioned.
Fortas Draught;Kaunas, Lithuania;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Volfas Engelman (Olvi);500ml bottle (Maxima, Vilnius) Pale gold, brief head. Vaguely lagery aroma, typical Euro macro, mostly a slightly sweet grainy maltiness. OK carbonation, watery palate. Taste, again simple bland grainy maltiness, and a finish that’s in part a bit of burnt caramel and toast - a bit like when you splash some on the sauna stones - and a touch hoppy too. Throughout there were hints of alcohol - retronasally while it’s in the mouth in particular. Not horrific, but not very good.

Nose suggests an orange marinade on roast duck, and sweet smoke. Plenty of earthy and grassy stuff underneath forming the real foundation. Tastes firstly of bark, pine nuts, and raw walnuts. Mildly fruity and juicy, but dry. The rye throws an earthy, intriguing darkness onto the traditional canvas of bubblegum, banana, and spices. Really an interesting effect. Moderate brown sweetness clings closely to the palate after swallowing. Another quick wink of citrus. Nicely done.

Its a very light easy drinking beer, I have never finished a growler between two people before this beer. Growler, shaker glass.

Flat Earth Bermuda Triangle Tripel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Saint Paul Brewing Company;Tasted with Lowther’s, really enjoyed. That wonderful barnyard funk, spicy and floral, double bubble and cotton candy, banana esters and a bit of malt, complex, great one to spend time on.
Flat Earth Bermuda Triangle Tripel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Saint Paul Brewing Company;Dark Golden with a cloudy appearance. The flavor boasts a strong, rich lineup of Bananas, Cloves, Caramel, Barley, Rye, Yeasts, and Floral Hops. The body comes off as a bit too watery for this style of beer, but it’s still quite drinkable and mildy crisp thanks to the carbonation. I’ll just close by saying that it’s beers like these that have very limited distribution that make me glad I made the move back to Minnesota.
Flat Earth Bermuda Triangle Tripel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Saint Paul Brewing Company;Bottle via a trade. Pours with a very minimal, fading white head. Hazed golden hued body. Aromas show a nice yeast character, musty, earthy, pear, mild phenols of clove, black pepper and allspice.

Flat Earth Bermuda Triangle Tripel;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;Tripel;Saint Paul Brewing Company;(bottle) Pours a clear light gold with a very thin white head. Aroma of banana, pale malt, honey butter spread over toast, pears, must, and a subdued floral element. Pretty good, it just needs to warm up a bit before the scents emerge. The flavor possesses plenty of banana, pale malt sweetness, slight butter, allspice, and a lingering stale bread crust finish coupled with a moderate bitterness. Little heat shows up here, but it’s not intrusive. I believe this is the only Flat Earth beer I’ve had that wasn’t carbonated to high hell, so I must give the palate a 4 for breaking that trend. Overall this is a decent beer, but the high asking price will not prompt a repeat purchase.
Vierling Amarillo Ale;Marquette, Michigan, United States;IPA;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;ABV 5.9% Draft @ Vierling brewpub. Copper colour, off-white head. Aroma is flowery hops. Flavour is flowery soft hops, fairly bitter, grapefruit, little toastiness. Nice.
Vierling Amarillo Ale;Marquette, Michigan, United States;IPA;Vierling Restaurant & Marquette Harbor Brewery;"On tap at the restaurant/brewery. Slightly hazy, rich orange body, thick buff head. Crisp, spicy, citrusy hops nose, zesty. Same for the body- citrusy, spicy Amarillo hops dominate the flavor profile, backed by modest bready malts. Tingling biter finish; crisply carbonated. A very nice IPA (or APA), my favorite beer at the brewery."

Rokovnjaè Temno;Lukovica, Slovenia;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Gostilna in Pizzeria Furman / Pivovarna Lukovica;Dark cloudy date coloured lager topped by a light off-white head. Sweet, rooty, cola-like nose is a good indicator for what is to come. A very sweet and rather gazy suite of rotting plums, stale banana bread and old coffee bag. Mediocrel.

Poured a full golden chill hazed body with a white head. Typical Slovenian/Croatian brewpub grainy aroma, lovely in this case, light honey and herbs. Mild taste, grainy again, slightly chalky, very light beets, not much hops, pretty much none, interesting apricot note. Fresh & interesting, without notable flaws. Could use more hops though.

Rokovnjaè Svetlo;Lukovica, Slovenia;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Gostilna in Pizzeria Furman / Pivovarna Lukovica;Like most Slovenian pizzeria/microbreweries, the beer is pretty bad. Hazy golden pour mounted by a fair, lasting white head. A rather worty concoction that comes across far too sweet and just very very grainy while wet, inefficient hops struggle to bring unity and balance. A train wreck.
Stewart's Vanilla Stout;Bear, Delaware, United States;Stout;Stewart's Brewing Company;"Cask at stewarts.... ""Stout of love"" Their website says something a little different but I figure this is the right beer. Nice cascading beer, mocha colored head, dark in color. Decent aroma of some roasted malts, coffee and some light vanilla. Taste is a well rounded stout.... Roasted malts, coffee, slight vanilla taste. Smooth easy to drink. I wish it was a little thicker but overall a nice stout."

Hikos Reserve Junmai Dry Sake;Ishibe, KOGA SHIGA, Japan;Saké - Junmai;Takenaka Shuzo Sake Co., Ltd.;Bottle... Pours crystal clear and would look like water if not for a trace of yellow. A few swirls of the glass offers a good, thick coating that slowly evolves into at least thirty weeping legs. Fruity, spicy nose is nice and provides surprisingly little alcohol. Full-bodied with a silky mouthfeel. The alcohol is subdued and the sweetness is pleasant. Finishes a bit dry. Very enjoyable. I would drink this again if it weren’t so spendy.

Russian River Toronado 20th Anniversary;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Russian River Brewing;Had this bottle with Bill, Frank, and Jeremy in 2012 the first time we hung out together outside of Philly bars. We slayed some insane whales this day including Jean Chris Nomad, 1996 Cantillon Classic, 3 Font 50th Anny, and more. Pours a hazy orange gold with a medium to bigger white head. Notes were minerals, stone fruit, brett, oak, lemons, white cherry, and other salivating tart funk. Really nice but everything was overshadowed by the 96 loon and 50th anniversary Drie Font

Russian River Toronado 20th Anniversary;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Russian River Brewing;I brought this one to Pre-Ffej to share with everyone, hope everyone enjoyed it. A - Pours murky brown with a nice one finger tall off white head, quickly dissipating down to a light film and eventually a ring around the edge, leaving small streaks of lace on the sides of the glass. S - Smells of dark fruits, toffee, caramel, oak, wine grapes, leather, a bit of musty barnyard funk, cherrie skins and some lactic sourness. There is definitely some oxidation there but not as much as I was expecting there to be. T - Starts off with the cherrie skins and dark fruits quickly being joined by the woody oak, wet leather, toffee and caramel sweetness, wine grapes, light must and funk and some light oxidation. Finish is quite dry, lingering long after the finish. M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Sweet feel initially goes quite dry at the end of each sip. Booze only really creeps in once it fully warms up. O - After hearing how much this had fallen off I was expecting a lot worse so this was a pleasant surprise. Yes it was definitely showing its age but it is hardly as bad as many people make it seem. I wouldn’t age it any further if you have one, drink it before it really does go off the cliff.
Russian River Toronado 20th Anniversary;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Russian River Brewing;Corked bottle. Amber color.

D- This was definitely a good brew and one to seek out. At 4 bucks a pour it seems like a steal even in a champagne flute.
Russian River Toronado 20th Anniversary;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Russian River Brewing;"Bottle: thanks, Mike! Murky copper color, some slight orange hints with a khaki tinted head that fizzles away to a collar pretty quickly. Aroma has notes of cherry skins, mild vinegar, sharp acidity, lightly vinous oak, & an undercurrent of cotton & hay-like funk notes, seemingly like Brett. Taste has a quick hit of tart acidity & sweettarts up front with notes of apple skins, cherries, & vinegar. There’s a mild perfume essence to the beer, as well. The tartness quickly fades into a subtle sweetness, finishing with some oak & vinous grape-like flavors. Overall, a very nice beer, though I do not believe it lives up to the hype it has been given. Perhaps it has ""fallen off"" a bit? Not nearly as sour as expected."
Russian River Toronado 20th Anniversary;Santa Rosa, California, United States;Sour - Flanders Red / Bruin;Russian River Brewing;Bottle. Pours a cloudy amber orange color with a light white head. Grape, oak, fruit, a little orange rind, and some floral notes. Medium mouthfeel. Nice carbonation. Tart but not overly sour, orange fruit, oak with some bitterness. The Brett comes out nicely.

Made with Cascade and Pioneer hops, which does provide some citric touches in the aroma, although its more lemon than grapefruit.

Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;10th rater, lets make this beer official. Sampler @ the brewpub, a full pour would be hard to take. The color is a hazy yellow/golden color with some random carbonation bubbles visible. Aroma is sweet vanilla from the combination of alcohol and malts. There is a light herbal and grassy aspect to it from the few hops peaking past the malts. There is a light earthy and musty heft to it. The flavor has more alcohol coming out, its a bit of a peachy-like alcohol. There is a bit of a weak feel and flavor and that is topped off by a hefty alcoholic and white bread maltiness. In general there is a bit of a rumble tumble feel to the beer, not well balanced despite tasting good. Just needs some more lagering to even out the alcoholic edges. But I would have this again as blond doppelbocks are few and far between.
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;Pours a honey lemon yellow with white head. Aroma is sour, lemony/citrus. Flavor is a bit sour and tart with hops with citrus malty undertones. Creamy body with light carbonation.
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;Sampler. Hazy gold. Light fruity and citrus aroma. Very sweet, almost too sweet for me. Different, solid.
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;This wasn’t even available on tap but the brewmaster was able to give us a generous free sample, as a bonus. Score! This pours a hazy yellow with a creamy pillowy head. Tangy lemongrass, along with some sweet buttery sugar flavor. I was pretty impressed with this brew. A very nice blonde doppel for sure.
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;Growler courtesy of Skyview. The beer was golden with very little foam. Not a typical blonde dopplebock. The sweet caramel malt that one would expect to taste is barely present. I think my rating would improve if I got to try this on tap.
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;Growler courtesy of Skyview. Pours a deep golden color. Slightly biscuity sweetness on the nose with a touch of an almost earthy hoppiness. Fairly simple and sweet with a lack of depth. Not their best beer.
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;From a growler. I am disapointed in this beer and it is the weakest I have had from this brewery. A gold doppelbock. Light caramel and grass aroma Low carbonation, just a little sweet and malty. Not really hearty but seems thin and more like a strong lager than a bock.
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;"Original rating, 9-2-07, 2007 edition: 1/2 liter pour on tap at the brewpub. Lemony, slightly sour, floral, yeasty aroma that suffers from being a bit ""beery"" (i.e., aroma somewhat like that of a typical American macro lager). Pours a hazy gold with a moderate amount of fluffy, off-white head. Pleasant, sugary, buttery aroma with a hint of peach. Improves on multiple sips. Delicious. Medium to full body. Lively and sharp in the palate; good bite, but very drinkable nonetheless, especially for such a strong beer. This is yet another very strong product from a very good brewpub. 6/4/8/4/17::3.9 Re-rate, 8-8-08, 2008 edition: Special approximately 5-6 oz. sample from the brewer. Sweet, yeasty, light, pleasant aroma features apricot scent. Pours a deep gold with a moderate to large amount of fluffy, white head. Sweet, fruity taste features orange, red apple, and candy apple flavors with a touch of lemon sourness. Medium body (heavy by lager standards). I like this beer, but I liked it better the first time I had it. I’ll keep the higher, original rating as the official one. 7/4/7/3/14::3.5"
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;On tap a the brewpub. Well, dis was definitely a doppelbock, though not cloyingly sweet as I find so many in the style. Light apricot flavor and a malty finish. Very nice.
Das Bierhaus Gambrinator;Menomonie, Wisconsin, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Das Bierhaus;"Stopped at the Das Bierhaus in Menomonie, WI for the Gambrinusfest Festival. This beer pours a hazy golden yellow brew with a thin creamy white head that has great retention and slow dissolve. Excellent lacing when drinking this brew. Aroma of sweet pilsener malt, sweet apples, some flowery hops with a touch of honey and apricots. Taste is smooth, creamy, semi-sweet with flavors of apricot bread, honey and sweet pears. Finish is slightly metalic from the near 9% alcohol which really warms up this beverage. The aftertaste has a slight semi-sweet apricot and light bread flavor that is a terrific match to go with their Anton Stiglmeier bratwurst with sauerkraut. This is a first time I’ve tried a ""Blonde Dopplebock"" which has a character like a sweet pilsener except with more barley malt, sweeter fruit flavor and more alcohol."

I sat outside in the biergarten drinking this, surrounded by almost nothing except silence, off the beaten track in green, flat, Schleswig-Holstein. The beer served a clear, golden color and a small but firm, white head. It’s a bit too sweetish on both aroma and flavor, but with sufficient hops to avoid it being cloying. It’s quite fruity too, decently bitter and with a faint note of banana. Some hay-like flavors. Medium body, low and smooth carbonation. Although on the sweet side, it’s a quite nice one, I guess the setting influenced a bit too. 110818

It’s light amber in color, clear, and topped by a light beige head of fingerthick size, cute lacings left as the beer is drank. It’s sweetish on the palate, caramel and butterscotch springs to mind, but the levels of butterscotch are very low. Some fruityness, and a delicius hoppy aroma with grass, some spiced and peppery notes and a touch of green pine cones. It’s more sweet on the palate than I would like it, at least if I am to treat it like the session beer I suppose it’s meant to be. Toffee and a fruity touch too. Medium to full body, smooth carbonation. Quite long finish with a nice and crisp bitterness. Overall, a quite nice one, but too much on the sweet side. 110818

Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle shared by cbk -- thanks, Craig (sort of). I was too sober to be drinking this beer.

Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;bottle-thanks.......? to Daknole for bringing this rare gem (?) to the Benson, AZ tasting. man, this beer sucks! deep clear brown with a very small brown head. nose is ungodly sweet-peanuts and candy sugar with a huge alcohol presence. man, this was hard to put down....fussel alcohol, but at 17% thats to be expected. when i was sampling this beer, i would cough everytime i smelled the beer.....thats not good! lots of sweet chocllate and peanut flavors here-a rare beer, but thats not always a good thing! avoid at all costs!
Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Brownish pour. aroma is sweet. WAY TOO sweet. Sugar, honey, syrup, and some teriyaki sauce. Flavor is much the same. Just an overall sugar bomb. Man oh man. So sweet you don’t even notice the alcohol. Meh.,
Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Thanks Jason. The beer pours to a flat looking mahogany color. The aroma is something like fermented corn and soy. Perhaps a hoisin sauce. Doesn’t really smell bad, but doesn’t smell like beer or anything remotely close. The flavor is like Chinese hoisin sauce, dried hard field corn, soy, and some strange other things. Weird. The palate is sweet. The booze is totally hidden. Not a drain pour because it totally sucks, but a drain pour because I don’t want to get drunk on such a silly beer.
Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Thanks to Nathan for the bottle. Poured clear medium brown with just a light ring of off-white head around. The aroma picked up warm toffee and other grainy dark sugars with a whole lot of weird stuff (a touch of garbage water, warm honey, soy, and smoke).. almost like a grain alcohol with Draino on the back. The flavor wasn’t really any better.. caramel, honey, and an odd biscuity sweetness at the core.. enough residual sugars around to mostly mask the huge dose of alcohol.. smoke, some grease, and unpleasant cleaner on top and through the finish. Medium-bodied with low carbonation on the palate.. the warmth really came through in the finish, but it was held in check by the underattenuation on the middle.. sharp, tacky, and ugly.
Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle at Tied House Unlike many people I found this to not be all that bad. Viewed in the light of a 17% ABV beer it lacks the flaws that some other ultra-high gravity beers possess. I would not drink more than a 200ml bottle but for something to warm the senses on a cold winter night it works quite well. I think this shows that hidden gems can exist among those love/hate beers of the world. Aroma / Appearance - Very flat with no carbonation as you would expect this swirled around the glass like a fortified wine. The nose was smoky like bacon and warm motor oil. Cherry seeds provide another layer of texture. For 17% it was not nearly as heavy as I expected it to be. Flavor / Palate - Heavy and cloying I did not detect many of the notes of soy as other people have. Warm through the palate it sits around a long time. Had I not eaten dinner a few minutes later it would probably have lasted for twenty minutes or more. This interesting beer is an experiment that seems to have gone mostly right.
Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;Bottle @ Muskoka Beer Festival 2009: Pours dark brown, no head. I know exactly what I’m getting into here but it’s a sample instead of a bottle and I need the rating. Aroma is.. wow.. booze, soy sauce, sugar. I’m going to wet my pants over the fact I have to try this. Flavour is strong, sweet, clings to the tongue like a leech. Thank God I tried the 15% version, I still dumped all but two sips of my 4oz sample. Horrific. The host told me most people today had ranked it a 1. He was half right.
Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;200 ml bottle from Garthicus. Nose is sweet toffee, dark fruitiness, candi sugar, and honey. Clear brown with almost no head. Flavor is sweet, with some caramel, and a hint of licorice. A Belgian Strong with honey added to boost the ABV to 17% maybe!
Trafalgar Black Bullet;Oakville, Ontario, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Trafalgar Ales and Meads;200mL from the X-Mas giftpack. Pours our a dark but still translucent brown with no head. The aroma is equally as horrifyingly awful as the Korruptor was, only with a bit more toffee malt to it. That same wet paper/pen ink booziness that haunts my nose for hours. Rotten bean spouts. The flavour is all cloying sweet terribleness with a lot of booze and maybe a hint of dark toffee malts. Absolutely awful. How Trafalgar can seriously present this as a consumable product is a question I’d like an answer to (if there is one).

Surly Barrel Aged Darkness (2007- 2012);Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Stout - Imperial;Surly Brewing Company;"September 19, 2015 - at Beaverton for the Rainbow event - draught. Even though I pretty much despise all bourbon, I was super stoked to finally get a chance to rate this one. Gorgeous beer - deep brown-black pour, with a large lasting brown head - doesn’t get much better than that. There’s a complex deep roast malt coffee/chocolate/herbal impy there, but wow is there a ton of bourbon overlaying it; oh well. Taste is better balanced - oddly sweet, with restrained alcohol. Syrupy, a bit still, a little too bourbony in the cloying finish - nice life to it - If I didn’t hate bourbon so much I would be about 4.2"
Triple 7 Espresso Stout;Las Vegas, Nevada, United States;Stout;Triple 7 Brewpub at Main Street Station;Had a sample offered to me after asking about it. Black coffee appearance with a brown head.

Surly BB Double Bender Experimental;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Surly Brewing Company;On tap at the 2007 GTMW: Pours a barely transparent dark mahogany with a large frothy dark tan head. Fresh grapefruity hoppy sweet dark malty aroma has a touch of brown sugar. Body starts rich, full and caramely malty with a very nice fresh piny grapefruity hoppy balance toward a resiny bittersweet finish. Nice complexity and big hoppy character throughout.
Surly BB Double Bender Experimental;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Surly Brewing Company;On tap at GTMW. Poured a very deep brown with a well-retained cap of creamy beige head.. looked great! The aroma picked up lots and lots of toasty sugars.. caramel, nutty notes, bunches of chocolate, and dark fruits all packed in there and all enhanced by the booze factor. Strong again on the flavor front with the dark fruits and chocolate taking over.. very warm with the booze presence.. too many residual sugars at the finish for my liking. Heavily-bodied and grainy on the palate.. very warm finish. This was good, but I got caught up a bit by the sweetness.
Surly BB Double Bender Experimental;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Surly Brewing Company;GTMW on tap. Dark brownish color. Smell of malt, caramel, burnt toast, sugar, and minor spices. Taste of the same but very sweet. Very different.
Surly BB Double Bender Experimental;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Surly Brewing Company;Tap @ GTMW. Opaque and midnight brown in color with a booming, tan sponge heat that’s virtually immovable for the head. Aroma rings brightly with steel espresso tins, blackened rye, lactic cocoa and mocha chip brownies all warming in the sun. Flavor produces an incredibly rich abundance of all that is tasty and wonderful on God’s given earth. Chalky dark chocolate gets condensed so much, it’s like a rate of one chocolate pound per ounce. Full bodied and chewy at all edges, with even a thick hint of grit at times. So smooth and seductive. The very essence of decadent chocolates and dark chocolate truffles is interlaced with caramel goop and Godiva liquor. Sensational fluid takes a mighty heft of the tongue to even raise it a centimeter for the palate to fully have at it. Quite possibly the biggest mouth load I’ve encountered, and my personal favorite of GTMW 2007.
Surly BB Double Bender Experimental;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;Strong Ale - American;Surly Brewing Company;GTMW 2007. The beer pours to a dark brown/black body with a large thick brown head. The aroma is dark breads and toasted caramel malts. White wine, herbs, and toffee with some maple syrup. Very interesting aroma. The flavor is molasses and toasted pale/brown malts with maple syrup. The palate is slightly tart and lightly acidic with a medium-full body and creamy texture. Slight astringency.
Butford Farm Nimbus (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Butford Farm Cider;Bottle from Three Counties Cider Shop, Ledbury, Herefordshire consumed at home Friday 10th June 2016 in the company of Lynn, Barry, Nick, Nellie and Julie. Not entirely sure if this should be a new version really as the latest version is 6% and the main apple varieties are Dabinett and Yarlington Mill, also unlike Matts bottle this certainly wasn’t Wotsit orange (great description btw, I can instantly visualise it). Golden in colour, a little hazy, with a dirty silvery sheen, soft in the mouth med/sweet, tangy but lacks a distinctive bite, fruity. Good but not great. A7 A3 T6 P4 Ov13 3.3
Butford Farm Nimbus (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Butford Farm Cider;75cl bottle from Butford Organics Farm, Herefordshire. Drunk in the garden. Not sure if I should be worried that the last rating here was back in 2009. This pours a Wotsits orange, completely flat with a musky, sweet, mushy apple nose. Taste is luscious apple tart & overripe apple with no discernible tang. Smooth and delectable blend and very moreish. Definitely deserving of a more sophisticated and sleek bottle design.

Butford Farm Nimbus (Bottle);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Butford Farm Cider;750ml bottle from ciderstore.com, July 2007. Hazy gold appearance. Sharp fruity aroma, with woody touches. Rather tart flavour, with plenty of residual fruit and a distinctly acidic finish (not in a bad way). Tannins are quite restrained but sufficient to provide some muscle. On the dry side of medium. A decent and tasty cider. Don’t know whether this is a regular product or a one-off as their website does not appear to be regularly updated.
Butford Farm Cider - Dry (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Butford Farm Cider;Box @ Cellar Bar, Chester. Pours misty yellow, aroma is wild, sour, bitter fruit. Taste presents quite a vicious bite, that seems somewhat foreign to Butford's bottled range, bringing to mind the likes of Gwatkins, Ralphs or other such farmhouse producers in its highly astringent ways. Chalky, cheesy, sweaty socks notes bind with this sour astringent character in a way that's difficult to like. An acquired taste.

Butford Farm Cider - Dry (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Butford Farm Cider;Handpump at the Pembury Tavern on 24 July 2011. Bit of confusion here. The pump clip said Silly Ewe (which is a Gwatkin cider) but a close examination revealed it was actually a Butford label stuck onto the Gwatkin pump clip with the Silly Ewe still showing. Noted at 6.7%. Orangey colour. Hazy. Fruity aroma. Not actually very dry. Some tannin but there’s a definite sweet feel - probably more from the fruit than sweetness itself. Overall a pretty tasty drop.

Butford Farm Cider - Dry (Draught);Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Butford Farm Cider;A Mes rate. Cask at the Southampton. Murky yellow brown coloured. A lovely drop of dry cider. Just sweet enough to stop it sucking your cheeks in but dry and tart enough to keep me chugging away at it. Really tasty apples, lots of skin, lots of flesh. Straight forward but very enjoyable but all of a sudden there is a hit of cinnamon that really makes it. Yum.

A hazy deep golden colour that poured very still, full of flavour but not as sharp as I was expecting. I had a couple of these and particularly enjoyed their perry as well.

Minchews Stinking Bishop Perry;Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England;Perry;Minchews Real Cyder & Perry;Polycask at Merton Summer Beer Festival July 19th This is one of those drinks that has to live up to its famous name following the instant popularity, courtsey of Wallace and Grommit. We had a good chat with Kevin Minchew the owner/producer of this cidery and were shown around his wonderfully chaotic but very historic machinery, Kevin knew his stuff and this Perry shows that quite magnificently. I also couldn’t help but think that the strange aroma had more than a passing similarity to the cheese (or just chess in general) or was that just the name playing in my mind? I don’t think so it was a touch cheesy. Poured light gold and quite interesting for a Perry in that i didn’t get the big juicy overipe pears that I often get, this was a bit more complex quite dry at times but the sweetness was there it just that it was well reined in, a hint of rhubarb played across my tongue once or twice and all in all a most enjoyable Perry. BTW I note that Kevin informed us that this Perry is actually the excat same Perry as the Malvern Hills version he does, Kevin said that he is ofetn requested to change the name depending on what side of the Malverns he sells it. It must be a Herefordshire and Worcestershire thing.
Minchews Stinking Bishop Perry;Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England;Perry;Minchews Real Cyder & Perry;A Mes rate: Barrel at Fin’s excellent Merton Beer Festival. Very pale hazy yellow colour. Lovely pear aroma, some wood and slight pear skin. Quite cheesy, I can really see why they wash cheese in this stuff. Flavour is wow. This is a bloody good perry. Just the right balance of sweet pears and woody sourness, a huge hit of both. Wine like full bodied feel. Impressive length in the sweet and sour finish that ends up very dry. Lovely stuff and with no hint of alcohol what so ever. A bloody good, well made perry.

Minchews Stinking Bishop Perry;Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, England;Perry;Minchews Real Cyder & Perry;"750ml bottle from ciderstore.com, July 2007. Stinking Bishop achieved fame as a type of cheese mentioned in the Wallace & Gromit film, ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"". However, Stinking Bishop is actually a variety of Perry pear and the name of the cheese comes from the fact that it is washed in Perry made from that variety. This is a clear, pale yellow Perry, without that silvery sheen that is often seen in Perries. Plenty of fruit in the aroma, with some petrol notes. Although this is described as a medium-dry Perry, I found it to be on the sweet side of medium, with plenty of fruit, reminiscent of stewed pears. A pleasant and easygoing Perry."

The looks of the beer aren’t bad. The beer has a nice ruby red/brown colour and has a nice unfiltered cloudiness. On top of the beer a nice light brown layer of soft foam is formed. Foam retention is fine. The smell of the beer is nice. Not worlds strongest smelling beer, but definitely not bad. I smell some nice malts. There are aromas of biscuits, some almonds, caramel and a hint of liquorice. Nice, and appropriate for a dubbel. There is a also a nice herbal touch of hops. Not bad. The taste is a bit more simple. Some rough malts, with some almond, caramel and liquorice and some bitter hops, with a herbal touch. There is a slight fruity kind of sourness, that is a bit out of place. Not completely balanced because of that. Palate is not special. Medium body, bit sticky and thin, rather low carbonation. Finish is rather short and contains only some malts and alcohol. All in all, not the best Abbey Dubbel around, but slightly above average."

De Peelander Witte Jan;Kerkwerve, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Peelander Bieren;Bottle from Bierkoning. Murky yellow body with tall head. Nose of honey. Quite sweet, with fruit flavours, including banana. To me though honey was the overpowering ingredient. Quite nice and smooth.
De Peelander Witte Jan;Kerkwerve, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Peelander Bieren;A truly funny beer...A white beer should list wheat as an ingredient, but it doesn’t. And believe it or not: I didn’t check the list but I was wondering what was so strange about this beer. It clearly lacked someting being a white beer, and that’s the ’creamyness’ of wheat. Coriander and curacao peel are very recognisable, but won’t lift this beer up above its peers (if it has any).
De Peelander Witte Jan;Kerkwerve, Netherlands;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Peelander Bieren;Quite an oily, fatty, Werthers Original palate and taste. It’s definitely white but the oilyness is just a little too much.
Peelander Pilsener;Kerkwerve, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Peelander Bieren;Drinking from a 25cl bottle. In the aroma hay, not so much. The clear golden beer has a large white head. In the taste a not so nice bitterness. Medium carbonated.
Peelander Pilsener;Kerkwerve, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Peelander Bieren;The beer has a nice look. The looks are more those of a Belgian blonde than of a pilsener. The beer pours a decent amount of rather rough white foam. The majority of the foam collapses quick, but a nice drape remains. The beer has a nice pale golden yellow color. The beer is a little foggy. You can see trough it, but vision is blurred. The smell of the beer is way better than that of simple pilsener. There is way more depth to it. I smell a normal pilsener layer, with bitter hops and a malty aroma, combined with an additional sweet fruity and floral aroma. There are more and fresher hop aromas than in most pilsener a, giving this beer s more distinguished smell. It smells more like a craft beer, instead of a simple production beer. There is also a nice almondy alcohol aroma in the smell. The taste is very nice. The beer has a good and strong bitterness. This is balanced out by a delicious sweet and delicate flavor, that had touches of strawberry and summer fruits. I also taste some grapefruit. There is also a nice fresh hop sensation in the taste. The beer is quite distinguished and refined. It is way better than most beers that have ’pilsener’ on their label. The palate is nice. There are a lot of tiny gas bubbles tingling the ting nicely. I like this one.
Peelander Pilsener;Kerkwerve, Netherlands;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Peelander Bieren;Clear with thick lasting, lacing foam head. Aroma is weak barley, and tastes like any other mass produced pilsner, although it can’t be as it is a home brewery. So, just average this beer. (Velp 201406)

Third Coast Old Ale - Bourbon Barrel;Comstock, Michigan, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Bell's Brewery;On tap at some point at bells. Took this rating from my notes.. And as I remember it tastes just like regular third coast used to taste. Somewhat disappointing when you wait what seems like forever hoping it’ll come out again only to just drink a pretty decent normal third coast. Whatever... It’s a barley wine the way they should taste so it’s all good.

Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;Tap at Eccentric Cafe: Hazy deep amber hue with a small frothy head and good lace. The aroma has notes of orange zest, coriander, white pepper, red wheat husks, bready malt, a hint of honey, piney hops, and some fusel alcohol. The taste starts with big sweet malts and twangy fruit with a heavy handed spiced finish. A bit of mint leaf and green tea towards the finish. The mouth feel is medium to heavy-bodied with noticeable alcohol warming. Is this a Wheat Wine or an Imperial Witbier? Either way it is strange for sure and hard to put a finger on.
Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;On tap @ Maduro, Bells GTMW pre-party 8/10/07. Cloudy golden orange with 2/3 finger creamy off-white head, fades to a thick film. Aroma of citrus, wheat, spicy grassy hops, alcohol, and a bit of white pepper spice. There was also a bit of raw honey and grain. Flavor was orange rinds, caramel, wheat, and alcohol up front. Still fairly peppery and the alcohol was a bit strong. Full body with moderate carbonation.

Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;Bells Right Coast [b]Draft at Maduro’s during GTMW weekend[/b] Cloudy orange cold color. Aroma is more towards the bitter orange peel (vs Bells Left Bank), still some spiciness, but the orange peel is the dominant aroma & flavor.
Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;Draft. Poured a light orange-yellow color. Head was white and one finger high. Aroma was of orange, white bread, and subdued fresh strawberry. Sweet on the tongue with alcohol, light cereal grain, tangy wheat, and subdued lemon zest flavors. There was also a bit of honey. I preferred the left bank, but this was still pretty good.
Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;tap at maduro. sorta rating from memory here. all i remember was that it was similar to the left bank, but was really minty and orangish. i thought it was excellent.
Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;"An interesting brew with an intense, boozy flavor. The color is deep orange. The aroma is malty caramel. The taste is a blend of orange peel, some caramel malt, and some spiciness -- there’s a kind of cinnamon sharpness, though I wouldn’t say it tastes like cinnamon. It’s sweet. but not in a malty/sugary way. There’s an alcohol presence even greater than you’d anticipate from the 8.4% -- it has that warming, ""waft through your head"" quality. For me this is a plus, at least at first -- but even the 10-ounce pour I had at Maduro was probably a little too much. The alcohol sharpness and the sweetness build up. So I’d highly recommend this in small servings, but it’s one of the least ""drinkable"" good beers I know of."
Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;On tap at Maduro for the GTMW pre party This one is all orange and I like it. Hazed yellow orange with some white head. Smells like sugar free orange rock candy, and tastes similar to a orange dream pop. Light and sort of milky palate. Really, this was nice for a one dimesional beer.
Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;On tap at Maduro – GTMW pre-party. Poured an almost clear medium golden with a short cap of white head. Aroma picked up a rather strong caramel presence with a much lighter wheat presence than the Left Bank.. very sweet overall, with only warmth from the alcohol making an appearance.. picked up some candy sweetness and a solid dose of orange peel as it warmed up. Flavor found very sweet caramel and candy notes, with increasing overt alcohol and candied sweetness toward the back and as it warmed.. accents of orange peel and a light touch of clove throughout, and more of those spices at the slightly boozy finish. Medium + bodied with some sharper points taking away a bit of the enjoyment.. long, warm impression on the finish. Similar score to the Left Bank, but for different reasons.
Bell's Right Bank Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Bell's Brewery;Tap at Maduro pre-GTMW party. The beer pours to a hazy medium amber body with a small white head that dissipates mostly. The beer is moderately malted in the flavor. Light bread, sugar, cereals, spruce hops, pears, toffee, honey, and white pepper. The aroma is caramel, dough, toffee, and perfume hops. The palate is slightly sweet with a medium-light body and an oily-soft texture. Slight alcohol is noticed.
Central Waters Tappers Tripel;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Central Waters Brewing Co.;Pours hazy dark copper with minimal head. Aroma of yeast, banana, citrus and spice. Flavor matches aroma with a light alcohol finish.
Central Waters Tappers Tripel;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Central Waters Brewing Co.;"On tap. Pours a strange, nearly clear but dirty copper brown that I don’t think I’ve ever seen in a beer before. No head to speak of. Aroma is slightly vegetal and smells like a glass that just got pulled out of the dishwasher. I’m pretty sure it’s the beer causing this particular olfactory sensation and not the glass itself. Flavor is a pretty straightforward Delirium-type Belgian ale replete with rich sugary malt with touches of clove, bubblegum and a dusting of earthy hops; however, it doesn’t quite have the oomph of a Delirium or Duvel. Alcohol shows up at the back of the throat upon swallow. Thankfully, the vegetal portion of the aroma never shows up in the flavor. Palate is big and thick and rich but a little flat owing to the near-total lack of carbonation. An ""OK"" beer, but a bit of a letdown."
Central Waters Tappers Tripel;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Central Waters Brewing Co.;On draught at the brewpub in Marshfield, Wisconsin. Brewmaster tapped the remaining of this batch for the 2007 Great Heron Homebrew Open on Sunday, August 19. Pours a hazy muddy golden amber brew with a creamy white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and spotty lacing. Aroma of yeasty banana bread, some orange and coriander and some sweet pears. Taste is medium bodied, lightly carbonated with flavors of banana, yeast, cotton candy and some herbal spice. Finish has a high 9% alcohol texture with aftertaste flavors of banana and multi-grain malt. The six-month aging of this brew was a nice touch.
Central Waters Tappers Tripel;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Central Waters Brewing Co.;"On tap at GTMW 2007 Since Central Waters typically releases good beers I thought I would give this one a shot. The best word I can think of to describe it is underwhelming. While it wasn’t exactly disappointing I was left wondering if there was another aspect to it that had gotten cooked out in the heat. I might have another pint of this if I ever get to the brewery but this shouldn’t be bottled at the expense of anything else. Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy mandarin orange body was a bit unusual but not totally unexpected. Oranges, coriander and cloves were most obvious but a soap background was a little offputting. It was fairly simple for a tripel if that is the style they were aiming for. Flavor / Palate - Cotton candy, soap and apple butter create a very unimpressionable flavor profile. The mouthfeel is creamy enough but lacks any punch to set it apart from any other tripel out there. In fact this is subpar even when compared to most American made releases. It’s still not totally poor; I would drink it again if I found it at the brewpub. I probably would stay away from a six pack though."
Central Waters Tappers Tripel;Amherst, Wisconsin, United States;Tripel;Central Waters Brewing Co.;On tap at GTMW. Poured hazy peach with a tall cap of off-white head. The aroma was chock fulla spicy Belgian yeast with white pepper, coriander, and lemon zest representin’.. some sweet bready notes and floral came through as well. The flavor had a great balance between the sweet base and the spicy accents.. floral and bready notes at the base, and white pepper and lemon zest surrounding along with mild floral bitterness. Medium-bodied with a creamy middle and again, quite nice balance. Hit the spot.

Baumer Lagerbier;Gars am Inn, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Privatbrauerei Baumer;A Mes rate: 50cl bottle at Quinns. Fairly boring but very drinkable German lager.

Third Base Oak Aged Bourbon Stout;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Stout - Imperial;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;Draft at 4th Annual Festival of Iowa Beers and at GTMW ’08. Black with ruby highlights and a brown head. Smelled of bourbon, molasses, vanilla, and toffee. There was also a whiff of cola. Medium bodied and semi-sweet with bourbon, vanilla, and milk chocolate flavors. A bit too much bourbon for me that mixed strangely with the lactose stout flavors. Earlier Rating: 8/13/2007 Total Score: 3.4 GTMW 2007. Poured black, but had hazy red highlights when held up to the sun. Head was off white. Aroma was of chocolate and malty cereal grain with a hint of cream. Medium bodied and delicately sweet on the tongue with chocolate truffle, singed bread, and subdued caramel.

Third Base Oak Aged Bourbon Stout;Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States;Stout - Imperial;Third Base Sports Bar & Brewery;"On tap at GTMW 2007. Poured a hazy deep brown with a tall, creamy beige head. Aroma picked up sweet roasted chestnuts and caramel with drier roasted cocoa behind.. also some marshmallow sweetness that was rather odd, but I like marshmallows. Semi-sweet roasted chocolate and caramel in the flavor department surrounded by light woody bitterness and vanilla.. bourbon makes a presence, but remains firmly entrenched in the background.. sweet and tasty.. not too complex.. long, sweet finish.

The beer pours to a murky mahogany body with a small creamy tan head that mostly dissipates. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, and marshmallow, with graham crackers and smoke. The flavor is chocolate, coffee, marshmallow, charred wood, vanilla. The palate is medium-light with a dry oily and medium astringency.
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;From a keg at a party. Pours frothy deep amber/orange. Light floral hop aroma. Flavor is well balanced, medium bodied with a strong malt backbone and light bitterness, but still refreshing. A great lager.
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;Golden and darker color with bubbly white head. Sweet and earthy, yet somewhat dull, aroma. Taste is malty, slight caremel. Not bad, but have had much better for this style
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;On tap at Half Acre, Pale golden color with minimal white head. Aroma is a bit of light fruit and a bit of corn, taste is floral and grain.
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;One of the better pale lagers I’ve ever had. Nice lively hop taste, without being an IPA. Refreshing. All pale lagers should be like this.
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;Poured from growler purchased by sherm1016. Thanks. Very fine lager. Orange with white head. Pretty spicy for a lager...tasty.
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;Poured from a growler from Half Acre. Pours a crystal clear, light amber color with a thin white head. Aroma is light, bready, faint bitter hops. Medium on the palate with average carbonation. Flavor is sweet, malty, bread, nutty, some bitter pine hops, with a light bitter finish. Very nice.
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;Enjoyed on tap at the Half Acre taproom. Served in a pint glass. A: Pours a golden amber color with a pure white head forming on the pour. It recedes slowly to a thin cap that leaves sticky sheets of lace down the glass. S: Vienna malt with light fruity hops. Some mild citrus with a lager yeast sweetness. T: Same as the nose. The Vienna malt is stronger and sweeter than the nose. Lagery yeast is present again with very light grass and fruity hops on the backend providing a touch of bitterness. M: Light bodied with a medium carbonation level. Sweet malt finish. O: Solid lager overall. Wouldn’t order this too often, but it’s very well put together. Serving type: bottle
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;5 ounce taster at the tap room, which is labeled on the menu as having a slightly heightened 6% abv. Aroma is funky, sweet malts. Appearance is golden with white foam on top, low amount of lacing and low bubble action. My tastebuds picked up on apple, bread, and some skunk. Palate is light and a little watery. Overall, this beer feels pretty traditional and sits in tough company among all the other creative options at the tap room. It’s still nice to have it available as a taste of the brewery’s beginnings.
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;Pours mid amber with malt notes off the start. Notes of dense grain drink quite refreshingly. For a straight up lager, this is fantastic.
Half Acre Lager;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Half Acre Beer Company;Clear orange with a white head. Grassy hop aroma. Taste is lightly sweet caramel malt with light toast and and dry spicy hop finish.
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draught at the brewpub Hazy golden color. Quite poor beer, where the fruits add a light acidity and fruity aroma.
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;A solid beer from Rock Bottom once again. The cranberry stood out just a little bit. The beer was actually surprisingly sweet I have a hard time wanting to get anything other then the barrel aged beers when I go though.
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;Tap @ RB Chicago – Gold, white creamy head. Nose held faint notes of sweet cranberry and grainy malt throughout. Flavor was very basic, sweet, with just a hint of spicy hops in the end. Light bodied, soft carbonation, light sweet fruity finish. They can’t all be gems here. The only miss for me on this day….
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;Draft sampler. Gold color. At the end of a sampler flight, there’s no head remaining. Aroma is not easy to discern in a smoky bar, but nice malts and fruits there. Cranberry is there, all right, but unlike many fruit beers, the fruit does not overwhlem the beer because its matched by the fruity tartness of the saison style. Something’s not quite together in my own palate, but it can be very likable.
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;Sweet and lightly fruity, but not running laps in a track meet of saisons. Well carbonated, small form bubbles, a bit gueuzey as it warms. Not bad. (On tap at brewpub)
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;Nice. It pours a hazy pale amber body tinted with pink and is topped with a big fluffy white head. Heavy Belgian lacing. The beers are being served too cold at the brewpub, but as it warmed I got a slightly funky, tart aroma in the nose accompanied by drying grasses and an underlying bready sweetness. The cranberries seemed to add more of a tartness than a fruitiness to both aroma and flavor. A dry bitterness is added to the flavor as well as a touch of sourness that intereacted well with the quiet malt sweetness and the cranberry tartness. Nice funky tart finish. I wish they’d feature this one year round. Rock Bottom Chicago, Chicago, IL
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;Thans Drewbeerme for saving me some of your glass. Amber with thin, white head. Fruity, mostly spicy aroma but very mild. Wierd fruit flavor, very sweet, some sour, grainy and wheat. Thin to medium body with little carb. Kind of strange tasting but not bad. Oh by the way Andrew, you’re a great rhymer.
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;on tap at the brewpub. pours hazy golden with white creamy head. nose has subtle yeasty spice and hay. flavor is initially sharp and tart with berry sweetness then a yeasty and somewhat spicy finish. this never seems to balance and flow throughout the profile as the fruit sends this whole thing off making this way too sweet for the style. more of a fruit beer than a saison and not really fun to drink. mouth feel is watery. carbonation is smooth but finish is short. perhaps fruit and saison don’t belong.
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;GTMW. Cask Tent. Enjoyed this one early in the festival, and it was perhaps the most refreshing beer on the day. Adding cranberries to a a saison is a marvelous idea, as the bitterness and flavor of the berries interacted well with the lemon and bread notes of the saison. Also present was orange peel and white grape. The finish was cranberry sour. Well done.
Rock Bottom Chicago Summerfest Saison;Chicago, Illinois, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Rock Bottom Chicago;On cask at GTMW. Poured hazy medium golden with a creamy cap of off-white head. The aroma was soft and creamy with a solid base of bready notes, light wheat, and lemon rind with sweet and tart cranberry accents. The flavor picked up a lot of cranberry sourness on top of the sweet bread and zesty lemon saison base.. picked up quite a bit from the berries.. tasty and refreshing! Lighter carbonation from the cask treatment with a creamy middle and long sour impression on the finish. This was a highly refreshing and enjoyable summer brew.
CooperSmiths Mellow Fellow Cherry Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;CooperSmiths Pub & Brewing;Draught at brewpub. Pours clear tawny with an average, creamy, off-white head, somewhat diminishing, good lacing. Aroma is average malt (bread, toasted grain), average hops (flowers, grass), average yeast (dough) with notes of tart cherries. Medium bodied, slick texture, soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Average duration, light sweetness and acidity, moderate bitterness.
Beer Works Yawkey Way Wheat;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Berliner Weisse;Beer Works;Draught @ Fenway location: This one pours a hazy golden color. It had a finger of a dense, foamy head. It left quite a bit of lacing. The aroma is lighter but quite nice. Wheat, and some lemon to go along with it. Maybe a hint of sourness. The taste is quite good. Wheat, some of the lemon, faint sourness and just a faint spice. A good beer.
Beer Works Yawkey Way Wheat;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Berliner Weisse;Beer Works;Multiple draught tulips at Fenway on 9/5 and 9/17/07 Bright golden-brassy color is clear, with a thin, white head that recedes to ring, leaving small patches of lace. Some light powdered sugar, vanillin and acetyldehyde are definitely noteable, as well as moderate acetic acid. The finish is long, however, and oily lactic acids slowly creep in. Straightforward notes of wheat add a slight tartness, and the nose soon accustoms itself to the slight flaws up front. Very low sweetness, though some lingering vanilla-like notes add a simple sugariness. Medium strength of aroma. The flavor really departs from the aroma, being far more expressive in its tartness. Definitely wouldnt call it sour, but regardless, the actual flavor imparted by the lactobacillus is quite dominant. Oily, woody notes of lemon, yoghurt and green apples are soothed by the wheat chewiness (though light). Spritzy carbonation helps add a brisk, refreshing element to it and the beer goes down all too quickly and easily. Light vegetal notes and esters combine on the finish (apple, rhubarb, strawberry). If perhaps not the best of its style, it’s nonetheless very competent and enjoyable, I thought.
Beer Works Yawkey Way Wheat;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Berliner Weisse;Beer Works;Tap @ Salem location, sampled without added syrups. Pours pale amber with a thin white head. Tart crabapple aroma. Light, watery body with moderate carbonation. Bittersweet wheat and lemon taste with a soft finish. Based on my limited experience, this seems to be a nice example of the style, but more on the ’training wheels’ end of the spectrum. Anyone who says the Beer Works version is too sour is a major Berliner Weisse wussy.
Beer Works Yawkey Way Wheat;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Berliner Weisse;Beer Works;"Tap @ Salem. Had both ""straight"" and ""red"". Pours a deeper gold with a very ample white head. Nose is acidic but not unpleasently. Without the ""red"", this was pretty acidic and sour but with a character that was interresting. Needed some of the syrup to offset the sour/tart notes. Had no woodruff(green) and barely any raspberry(red). The second half of the brew I had with the red the last sip which was housing the most syrup was delicious and I wished they had the woodruff which I would have had throughout. I do enjoy this style, refreshed and light....with a syrup."
Beer Works Yawkey Way Wheat;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Berliner Weisse;Beer Works;On draft at Fenway location, where the bartender acknowledged this is a very misunderstood beer. Dark gold in color with some lacing. True to style with a pungent apple vinegar flavor. Palate smooths and flavor is less harsh as it warms.
Beer Works Yawkey Way Wheat;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Berliner Weisse;Beer Works;Bartender made me sample this beer before i got a pint because aparently so many people send it back. Sour taste like sour milk in the beer. Only get beer taste in the smell which is of wheat, and at the finish which smells like a red ale. Refreshing but made my stomach turn. A new beer experience for me. A must try.
Stix Bodacious Blonde;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Well this is probably past its prime eh? Nose is of brine, honey, old ass hops, dust, cardboard. Pours golden with great head retention, clarity, and decent lace. Flavors of brine, cardboard, dust, honey, light belgian yeast. Leaves a weird biley mouth feel and left over flavor had I just puked. Its not as bad as it sounds, but the more I think about it, the worse this becomes. Would have liked to try fresh as it was probably decent. Oddly tangy as well. Hmmm...
Stix Bodacious Blonde;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;<b>22oz Bomber - By the Bottle - Vancouver, WA </b><br /> Aroma – Nice Belgian aroma with a light fruitiness. <br /> Appearance – Golden yellow color, Light fluffy head and hazy. <br /> Flavor – This was a nice beer to drink. The Belgian flavors where light. There was some nice qualities to this beer. Very hoppy for a Belgian beer. <br /> Palate – Nice Mouthfeel, Good texture with a decent finish. <br /> Overall – A nice Belgian with too much Hops. Odd to say but this beer needs very little with the hops. Not sure why people flock to Belgian beers they seem like a lot of trouble and have a very low success rate as to being either awesome or really bad.
Stix Bodacious Blonde;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Blonde-bronze with nice foam head. This caught me slightly off-guard as I was expecting a typical, bland American golden ale. However, from the first whiff, I detected an enjoyable hoppiness, which was hoppier than their lackluster IPA. Sprightly, yeasty zip to the nose. A flavor with a complexity of hops, and an interesting American-belgian yeast character. Decent.
Stix Bodacious Blonde;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;"From a 22-oz.--poured a rich copper-orange hue with a thick fluffy white head. Great nose of sweet floral notes and bready malts. Flavor was smooth and well balanced. Rich and creamy; sweet and smooth. Mild boozy finish. Very nice beer!"
Stix Bodacious Blonde;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Orange amberish color with a large frothy white head. Sweet malt aroma with elements of bread, fruit, and alcohol. Medium bodied. Dynamic combination of flavors consisting of sweet malt, fruit, bread, and a long lingering alcohol finish.
Stix Bodacious Blonde;Seattle, Washington, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Stix Billiards & Brewhouse;Bottle: Dirty golden, quite dark, even a bit murky, large frothy white head, spotty lacing.   Sweet malty nose, very minor bready notes with a touch of pale fruit skin, Apricot or Peach to be exact.   Semi-sweet malts on the tongue, soft pale fruit skin, somewhat mealy, and quite warming.   ABV is well hidden.   Moderate body and mouthfeel.   Lingering mealy/bready malts with minor raw floral notes.   Some heat shows up at the exit but it still remains fairly smooth.   Bigger than your average Belgian Blonde.   Would be interested in trying this on draught.
Sherwood Stimulator Dopplebock;Shelby Township, Michigan, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Sherwood Brewing Company;Draft sample at 2007 Michigan BGF. Poured clear brown color with a moderate light brown fizzy head that diminished slowly with good lacing. Good caramel toasted aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture. Good roasted bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good doppelbock.
Saugatuck Dortmunder Lager;Douglas, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Saugatuck Brewing Company;Golden pour with light white haed. Light caramel sweetness, touch of biscuit, and a light floral hoppiness. A hint of fruity yeast esters, more in keeping with an ale, I think. Average.
Saugatuck Dortmunder Lager;Douglas, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Saugatuck Brewing Company;MBG. Light amber, minimal head. aroma has some fruity esters, almost ale yeast like. Flavor much the same yeasty esters and some lightly cloying malt. Not a very good dort at all.
Saugatuck Dortmunder Lager;Douglas, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Saugatuck Brewing Company;Draft sample at MBGF07. Poured clear amber color with an average frothy white head that diminished slowly with fair lacing. Light sweet hoppy aroma. Medium body with soft carbonation. Light bitter flavor with a smooth bitter finish of moderate duration. Drinkable but not a standout brew.

J.W. Lees Moonraker (Cask);Middleton, Greater Manchester, England;Strong Ale - English;J.W. Lees;On cask at the Standing Order. Appearance - almost black but with orange chinks. Thin head. Nose - toffee and orange. Taste - same again but also getting into molasses bread. It opens out into prunes and candied orange peel. Still molasses. Palate - rich and medium to full bodied. Crunchy yet tangy through the middle and finish. Overall - oh yeah! A beer for the beer nerds. Make more of this kind if beer please. Complex and enjoyable.

A sweetish, slightly sticky, spicy fruit finish. A slick and malty strong ale with a ton of spicy fruit, nice flavour. The only thing that lets it down is the flat and slightly sickly texture.

Taverners Honey Mead Ale;Launceston Tasmania, Australia;Mead;Taverner's Products;Pours deep amber with a large head. Nose shows honey, bready and toasty malt. Flavours include more honey, some soft bready malt, little else. Carb in unnecessarily aggressive.
Taverners Honey Mead Ale;Launceston Tasmania, Australia;Mead;Taverner's Products;Bottle from Hobart Airport February 2014. Sweet as you would expect I guess. Dark amber colour with no bitterness and a bit thin for me.
Taverners Honey Mead Ale;Launceston Tasmania, Australia;Mead;Taverner's Products;330mL/11.1oz bottle from the salamanca markets in TAS. Pour deep mahogany with a very peculiar aroma, honey/molasses/plastic. The bottom of the bottle is dated BB 12.10.12 (which i didnt see before i bought it) so I’m assuming its quite old and a shadow of its former self. I wish i had got a fresh bottle on my holiday because i would have been able to give this beer an accurate review. I think in its current state this beer is a sinker..
Taverners Honey Mead Ale;Launceston Tasmania, Australia;Mead;Taverner's Products;Bottle - Dark murky honey brown. High carbonation. A little thin. Strong honey flavour but not overly sweet.
Taverners Honey Mead Ale;Launceston Tasmania, Australia;Mead;Taverner's Products;Tried out of a stubby at the Tassie Beerfest 09. Dull looking light tawny body with short head. Less of a cough lolly in the taste but really no better. They push the honey more than the gluten free aspect.
Taverners Honey Mead Ale;Launceston Tasmania, Australia;Mead;Taverner's Products;Purchased this bottle at the same place as the strong mead ale. This label is designed the same way, with a realistic honeybee in the center, only the background is bright red instead of blue. Pours a murky amber brown with a rapidly receing off-white head. Rich ripe melon and honey aroma. Pleasant notes of honey and caramel, but surprisingly light in sweetness. Palette is somewhat watery with hard carbonation, but overall not bad.

Wadworth Horizon (Cask);Devizes, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Wadworth;Not the best golden ale, but pretty pleasant after spending a bit too much time drinking more aggressive beers earlier.

Leopold Brothers Blonde;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Draft at the brewery. Golden color, standard appearance. Typical recipe for a blonde or golden, basically, smelling and tasting like a kit brew, with faint sweetness, light straw and honey notes, a little green/vegetal, a little sour. Finishes empty. A very basic beer.
Leopold Brothers Blonde;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Leopold Brothers Brewery;On tap at the brewpub. Skanky rotting banana aroma, light cheese rind and some dried dead grains. Pours a much too clouded gold, with a fluffy white head above. Tastes dead. There’s compost, and bad off-flavors, undue yeast byproducts, and just plain messiness. Rubbery. No hops. There’s something wrong on many levels here. The house yeast spits out lots of bad things in line with unclean minerals, and the hops just taste like death. They have a palpable dead plant taste. Gross.
Leopold Brothers Blonde;Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Leopold Brothers Brewery;Draft at brewpub.

Skinners Cornish Lager;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Clear 330ml bottle, back-to-back with Pannepot GR ’05 and Moor Fusion ’09. Can it withstand that kind of competition? Well, actually, yes it almost pulls it off. Bright, faintly hazing gold with a collar of white foam in the bottle, which is where I’m drinking it from. Lime, grass, rabbit piss (really) and compost aroma: oddly refreshing like a squirt of Jif in the eye after a slew of narcotic, sticky big sippers. Obviously slight, limey and metallic with dabs of butter and shortbread at the edges, but a grassiness and wholemeal malt character that partially salvages the experience. Chlorine, lime, Innis and Gunn sickliness and cleaning products to the fore. I sort of grudgingly admire the fact they’re marketing a clear-bottled, lime and vegetable-accented suck of wet air at the surfer market whilst discreetly sneaking a shred of quality under the radar. Good luck to ’em.

Skinners Cornish Lager;Truro, Cornwall, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Skinners Brewery;Draught at The Cove, Covent Garden, London. A light golden beer with an off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty with light citrusy notes, but also an acidity that reminds me of brewing cereal of some kind. The flavor is sweet with notes of brewing cereal and malt, leading to a slightly bitter finish.
Iron Hill Oak Aged Double Wit;West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Iron Hill West Chester;Rerated to fix spelling errors. Promo special brew created by Chris LaPierre for IH Mug Club members. He hopes to bottle some of this for GABF. The pour is hazy dark straw with 1-finger off-white head. Aroma is honey, citrus, funky Belgian yeast, clove, candi sugar, and cabernet. Tastes hopcitric, with clove, orange zest, honey, and a mid to late palate explosion of oaky red wine, plus berry fruits. This one is very unique, very complex, and one of the most enjoyable and original styles I’ve quaffed in years.

SchillingBridge India Pale Ale;Pawnee City, Nebraska, United States;IPA;SchillingBridge Winery & Microbrewery;When I describe an IPA aroma and flavor as being dank, it’s almost always complimentary. Not in this case. This IPA is dank in an unrefined, stale way. Worse, it’s not especially hoppy or crisp. Really disappointing IPA.

SchillingBridge Stout;Pawnee City, Nebraska, United States;Stout;SchillingBridge Winery & Microbrewery;Constantly changing at the brewery. Last time I tried it they had made it more of a porter. Lots of coffee flavor, slightly smokey. Excellent porter. Told they are switching back to the traditional stout. Customers in the area say latest batch it too bold. I loved it. Traditional stout is my favorite beer at Schillingbridge. Very smooth, roasty, coffee stout. Only available at the brewery.

SchillingBridge Git R Done;Pawnee City, Nebraska, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;SchillingBridge Winery & Microbrewery;Poured from a refrigerated bottle received in the Local for Local Part Threeve from unclemike. Thanks! Pours a hazy copper color with a white head of foam that dissipates pretty quickly. The aroma is light fruitiness and a little grassy. Some corn comes through as well. The taste is very fruity and lightly bready. The corn is what comes through the strongest, though. Creamed corn. It’s alright. Probably not something I’d want again, but I don’t mind it really.
SchillingBridge Git R Done;Pawnee City, Nebraska, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;SchillingBridge Winery & Microbrewery;Bottle, courtesy unclemike. Pours clear golden yellow with a scant and fading white head. Vague bits of toffee, grassy hops and soap in the aroma. Light body, moderate carbonation. Lightly sweet taste, faintly grainy. There’s not much here. Seems reflective of the current mainstream American taste, with so little hoppiness it doesn’t so much finish as fall off the end of the world.

Aroma is corn and...corn...not sure there’s any other way to say it. Flavor is clean and simple, not terribly different than any macro, but a touch more grain punch. If you expected a hop bomb or anything spectacular, I would ask what you’re smoking...it’s a pale American lager! For what it is, not too shabby!

Rock Bottom Yorktown Happy Pils;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Draft on tap at the brewpub (Lombard, IL). Pours a nice deep orange gold hue, touches of amber orange glow, just a faint kiss of haze. Darker middle shows more orange glow on the edges. Cakey whitish head atop stays as a nice layer, decent lacing, nice stick around. Aromas show an earthy hop bouquet, florals and grass meet some distinct spiciness, touches of bread, gentle honeycrisp malt, grain and cereal elements. Decent spiciness. Initial is lighter end of the fold, distinct bready and biscuity malts meet, a bit toasty with some earth presence, more biscuit, firmer earthy hops kicks into the fold. Florals, grass, a bit of sun tan lotion, dandelion. Middle is a bit more biscuity, earthy. Nice floral and grassy hop presence, that spiciness meets a touch of honey brown, some gentle sweetness really gets covered by a more earthy, fully dry feel overall. A bit of body, biscuit and carmelized feel is a bit out of place though. I feel like darker malts were used here that you wouldn’t find in a Pils, perhaps more of a Helles. The big earthy hop bitterness is solid, nice, bitter, but it needs to be. Finish is a bit graainy, raw and a touch toasty, firmer earthy hops trail off. A bit firm and the malt elments really stick through to firmly for this to really be a Pils. It can be a Lager, but really it’s hard to call it a Pils. It has that big earthy bitterness, gentle to firmer spice. But the maltbill seems all out of whack for what it’s supposed to be. Solid beer, nit a good fresh hoppy Pils example.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Happy Pils;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Yorktown;"On tap and served to a club mug, with a clear, golden color, 3/4"" of white, creamy foam, but minimal lacing. The aroma was some light grain, pils malt, light sweetness, a little noble scent, and lightly spiced. The flavor added to these a medium, lingering hop bitterness, in a light bodied brew. The hop characteristics were more prominent than most Bohemian Pilseners, but I liked it. Should rename this ""Hoppy Pils"", as I enjoyed another mug full at the Yorktown location. Presented a bit of light toast & caramel to the nose, which was possibly food service prompted, still an assertive, earthy and lingering hop bitterness, with a bit more heft to the body this time."
Rock Bottom Yorktown Happy Pils;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Yorktown;Growler filled earlier today. Pours slightly hazy gold with white head. Nose has a soft wet grain aroma surrounded by a mix of floral, grassy, and spicy hop notes. Flavors are a touch sweet and under attenuated for me while spicy and bitter metallic notes finish. Just okay.
Rock Bottom Yorktown Happy Pils;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Yorktown;From the tap this poured a bright yellow/golden body with a decent head that laced the mug in rings. As it warmed to an appreciable temperature, you could smell sweet malt, honey, and a rich floral/grassy hop bitterness. The flavor has a well rounded, sweel malt base, and brewmaster Tim Marshall had no light hand in adding the hops, interestingly switching from the nose’s flaoral/grassy bitterness to a grassy/floral bitterness. The finish is a sturdy hop spiciness. Nice job. Rock Bottom Yorktown, Lombard, IL
Rock Bottom Yorktown Happy Pils;Lombard, Illinois, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Rock Bottom Yorktown;"Mug Club mug.Rings of foam on the side of the glass. Color is just on the light side of a Pils. I got an unfrosted mug, but the pour is still pretty cold, which I think inhibits any delicate odors. Can get a pure ""beer"" smell with some nice hop notes. Taste is of light pils malt, a trace of honey roast. Hops may tend toward a more bitter and spicy Dortmunder, or maybe I’m just looking too hard for floral hops when someone hands me a microbrewed Pilsner. No doubt, though, this is a great lager with plenty of malt and nice spicy hops."

Mighty Oak Solitaire;Maldon, Essex, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Mighty Oak Brewing Co.;"Cask (handpump) at the Wenlock Arms, Islington. Probably a one-off special but it is rather hard to tell with Mighty Oak as they make a lot of different beers and the website is perpetually ""Coming Soon"". Pale gold colour. I think there were some subtle floral notes in the aroma but these were rather compromised by an unwelcome whiff of diacetyl, which is the last thing that a delicate golden beer needs. Thankfully, the diacetyl is less evident in the flavour, but a nagging vestige remains. There’s a light, sweetish, pale malt presence on the palate but the overall impression is quite dry. I imagine this would be a pleasant enough, easy-drinking refresher without the diacetyl but, whilst not overwhelming enough to completely dominate the beer, it certainly reduces the enjoyment. Drinkable, but not one of Mighty Oak’s better efforts, unless the conditioning was at fault."

BEFeD Birra Speziale Strong;Mestre, Aviano, Brescia etc., Italy;Sour / Wild Beer;BEFeD;Poured a dark copper color with a medium sized light beige head. Aroma of malt, sweetness, some sourness, perhaps light vinegar. The bartender couldn’t tell me what style it was and upon my first sip, I had difficulty pinpointing a style. It may not even be an ale but drinking the entire half pint, plus bringing home a 1l growler, it leads me to believe it’s a flemish sour ale. Flavor is moderate funk sourness and fruitiness with some touches of cherry and juicy fruit gum. Light varnish notes. Weighed in at a hefty 8.3%. I thought this beer rocked pretty good. Hell, that sourness may be an infection for all I know.

Alehouse Butts Out;St. Albans, Hertfordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Verulam Brewery;Cask (handpump) at the Wenlock Arms, Islington. Presumably a Smoking Ban special. I’d been getting pretty disillusioned with this style as too many of the beers were beginning to seem pale, clean and not a lot else. However, this was a quintessential example that I enjoyed very much indeed. Pale gold colour, tending towards straw. Massively aromatic, flowery nose. Equally floral aroma, packed with fragrant but spicy hops. The mouthfeel holds the line with a firm bite. OK, it may be a little one-dimensional, but when the dimension is a good as this, I’m not bothered. An excellent, tasty brew served in tip top condition.

A golden coloured beer with a thick creamy white head. The aroma has some hoppy notes but also a little acidity. The taste is fruity. There are hops but the overriding impression is of sweetness. There’s a certain tingle to the beer which isn’t overly pleasant. It’s odd and interesting. It’s breed with Polish hops hence the name and I’m not sure whether they work in this type of beer.

Brains SA Gold (Bottle);Cardiff, Wales;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Brains;"06-07-2019; bottle; at home (bought at: White Lion Royal Hotel, Bala, Wales). The looks of the beer are fine. The beer is absolutely crystal clear. It doesn't fizz a lot. The colour is golden yellow and it has a lovely golden glow. On top of the beer there is a nice layer of crispy white foam. Foam retention is average. A fine drape is left after some time. The aroma of the beer is fine. Not super special. The malts are fine and gentle. Quite soft. It is nice. The hops are soft to, but they have a crispness at the same time. The crispness comes from some lovey citrus notes. The beer doesn’t have a lot of aroma. It is pretty basic, but a lovely thirst quencher due to its simplicity. The hops stand out. They have a remarkable citrusy touch, that goes well with the soft malts. The taste of the beer is fine. Flavours aren’t too strong. The malts bring some sweetness to the beer. The hops are bitter. Also a tiny fruitiness is there. The beer is well balanced. Nice and accessible. I like it. The palate of the beer is fine. Soft, medium-light body, velvety and low carbonation. Maybe a bit rougher than the cask version, this was more gentle and had a bit less of the bitterness. The finish of the beer is nice. It has a nice hint of alcohol, malty touch and some bitter hops. It is’t to long. It ends with some lovey dry bitter notes. I like it a lot."

SA gold is a british golden ale akin to the likes of old golden hen, or fursty ferret. these are probably crappy, ham-fisted comparisons but they are the first that spring to mind. i was initially disappointed, expecting it to be some sort of prestige improved version of the original, but with age has come an appreciation of this brew.

If there were such a thing as a sipping beer, I would have to say this was it! The depth of the bourbon, the malt complexities, amazing. When I opened the bottle and poured and there was little to no head on the beer, I first thought it was flat - not realizing the one-year rest in the barrel calmed it down and smoothed it out.

More heady smelling than the previous Killer Wood offering. Still a touch of tartness in the nose. Taste is thick and chewy. A little sweet and tart fruit, like a German white wine. Add to that the expected brandy, vanilla and oak notes, plus some alcohol warmth, and it’s quite the winter beer. A bit of phenolic band-aid pops in midway through, but that’s a risk with high gravity.

Although the peated malt wasn’t all that evident to my weak nose, I could definitely taste it. The roasty and smoky malt jived nicely with the molasses and vanilla flavors. It seemed to me that the alcohol weighed in greater than the advertised 8.3%. I liked this much better than the regular version that came out in the winter of 2006.

Hoornse Hop Tarwebier;Hoorn, Netherlands;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Hoornse Hop;Very difficult to place this beer in a category. It looks like a darker hefeweizen with its cloudy nutbrown appearance. But aroma does not contain any banana, but more wheat, grain, bit nutty, some caramel. The taste is very much wheat, but not quite sweet, more bitter. Thick body, like in a hefeweizen. It’s something in between a hefeweizen, a dunkelweizen and a specialty grain, and then a little belgian touch added to it. Not bad though.

Clear pale amber with a white head. 3+ Promising aroma is fruity and floral with bread crusts and a hint of roasted malt. Light bodied, highish carbonation.

Nose has some nice esters. Floral nose, and when tapped out for me at the brewery in Launceston, had the faint aroma of summertime lavender. For me, this was just one of those lovely epiphanies. Mouthfeel is sudsy. Roasty malty flavors predominate with a very nice hop balance to ensure a nice clean finish. Bitter hop finish that for me was medium. A very nice effort.

I think I have womencantsail to thank for this whale. Pours a hazy dull, dark orange appearance with little head. The aroma has a lot of acetic acid, chemicals / acetone, and a dull fruitiness.

Murky red-amber with no head, no lacing / Sour, acetone nose of orchard fruit and oak / Nope, as bad as the rest . . . . Just awful.

Initially there is also a foamy white head. There is quite a bit of ginger and lemon in both the aroma and flavor.

Floral grain malty aroma with matching sweet tastes of grain and mint. The flavor has a little tang to it like peppermint or chamomile tea. The feel is real smooth.

Sockeye Rusted Hook Rye;Boise, Idaho, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Sockeye Brewing;Draft: Pours a clear amber color with a small beige head. Some of the stickiest lacing I’ve seen in a while. Nose is mild of herbal and floral tones, some hints of mint? Smooth taste features more florals, a little grassiness, malty, and well I guess that must be the cardamom. On a different path than other rye beers I’ve had, but good.
Sockeye Rusted Hook Rye;Boise, Idaho, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Sockeye Brewing;On tap at Bittercreek Alehouse in Boise. Light copper color with a thin white head. Vague malty aroma, bit of floral hops in there, too, but mostly a malt show. Slight bitter start yields to the maltiness. The finish has a moderate hop presence, especially for a rye brew. Palate was surprisingly thin for a rye-involved beer. Interesting subtleties, but not real exciting overall.
Sockeye Rusted Hook Rye;Boise, Idaho, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Sockeye Brewing;On Tap at the Brewpub. Clear medium redish brown. Nice creamy light tan head. The sligtly bitter woody Rye flavors work well. Would not have guessed cardamom but for the brewer himself coming out and chatting about it. A bit spicy but just barely.

The flavor has a nice malty body with a clean doughy sweetness to compliment the spicy rye and cardamom notes. The finish is balanced, some light coriander and more caramel. Long spicy tail. The rye blends well and the cardamom adds a little interesting twist.

Judging by other Ratebeerians’ opinions of this beer, it’s likely I just got ahold of a bad batch. Maybe I’ll re-rate someday...
Warbird Shanty Irish;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Warbird Brewing Company;Sampled December 2009. Bottle. Poured copper with fluffy off-white head. Light butterscotch aroma. Similar butterscotch flavor. Eh! Warbird brewery went out of business summer of 2009. Probably not a tragedy that there won’t be any more of this beer.
Warbird Shanty Irish;Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Warbird Brewing Company;"Sampled February 2010 A soft pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a finger and a half of pale-amber tinged, tan colored froth. The beer is a deep red / concentrated amber hue that shows an almost brilliantly clear, bright amber color when held up to the light. Richly malty smelling with lots of caramelized malt character; notes of brown sugar, toasted grain, spicy rye, sweet tea, dried red-currants and other berry notes are all found here in the nose. The aroma ends up quite fruity smelling, but does have a sort of peppery spiciness to it that adds some intrigue. This is medium bodied, though not as sweet as the aroma might have suggested. It does have lots of caramelized malt character to it as well as a hint of grain husk toastiness in the finish that makes it seem like a touch of roast malt was added to this recipe. A touch of spiciness in the finish, as well as a light bitterness show the kiss of hops here; though it can get a touch green and astringent depending on the particular sip. While there is definitely a malt heft to this beer, it is still they type of brew one would drink a couple pints of. This is a beer that the malt lovers out there will definitely like. This beer is richly malty with lots of flavor, but still quite drinkable. I am definitely enjoying this more than I expected."

Marston's Hoggys Night Watchman (Cask);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Marston's;Cask at GBBF 08. Gold, lasting creamy head. Bit of Burton snatch on the aroma. Some biscuit, faint hop on end. Let’s say that Hoggy is a better night watchman than this is a bitter.
Marston's Hoggys Night Watchman (Cask);Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Marston's;Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Gold with a small white head. Odd, slightly ashy aroma develops into sweet maltiness. Taste begins with a distinct blackcurrant fruitiness, quickly replaced a grainy, biscuity taste with a sharp bitterness. Lots of flavour. Unusual beer, which I quite liked. Incidentally the pumpclip makes it seem that the brewer is ’Hoggys’. The ’Marstons’ logo is small and insignificant, as if they have something to hide.

Grumpy Troll Maggie Imperial IPA (Bourbon Barrel);Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;"On tap at brewpub This was the real reason for a Saturday visit. I hope this is on tap in a week’s time when I head out again. It is one of the better imperial IPAs I have tried. The barrel aging really compliments the natural flavors well. Give it a try if you can make it there in the next few weeks. Aroma / Appearance - The chestnut brown body looked just like the regular Maggie IPA. The head was the color of pale ash. Oak, vanilla, caramel and old pine enrich the senses. The bourbon is stronger than the base beer but not by much. To approximate the overall aroma take bourbony notes and combine them with chocolate brownie mix. Flavor / Palate - The creamy mouthfeel coats the throat in warm estery goodness. There is a hint of booziness but not enough to overwhelm the dry aftertaste which is not unlike licking a spruce tree (or making a pine needle smoothie). Oak, vanilla, chocolate syrup and caramel float on the tongue as it begins to warm. The opening is all bourbon; the close all imperial IPA. It is very well balanced and worth the visit."
Grumpy Troll Maggie Imperial IPA (Bourbon Barrel);Mount Horeb, Wisconsin, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Grumpy Troll Brewery, Restaurant and Pizzeria;GTMW. The finest IIPA of the festival. Poured a golden cloudy hue. Notes of oak and pine on the nose lead into lemon zest, ginger, lemongrass, blue spruce, and cedar. There’s something to the beer in the mouthfeel and character that reminded me of a well made German Hefeweizen (minus the banana/clove flavors), albeit with considerably more hops. Hops are balanced well by the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is full and rich, with an abrasive hop finish. I came upon this one by chance, and it was one of the best surprises of the festival for me.

Bobcat Cafe Downtown Brown;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Poured into a pint glass at the brewpub, the appearance was a moderately dark brown color with a sly transparency to it. Bar pour’s kind of slim white head dissipates immediately. No lacing. The aroma starts with roasty sweet nutty to caramel and then some nutty malts. Sly grassy, semi-dirty/earthiness, mostly acceptable. The flavor leans nutty sweet, nice roasty level, acceptable bitter grassy happiness to balance. Sly sweet nutty aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this was a decent sessionably smooth Brown ale deep with a rich sly maltiness laying down on my tongue appropriately. Carbonation seems to ride nice and low. Overall, nice English styled brown ale that I would have again.

Mouthfeel is round and creamy, soft bread crust, walnuts, a bit of caramel, some notes of refreshing fruit salad and a light tartnesss. Straightforward beer but nonetheless a very good example of this simple style, nothing super-exiting but I could drink pints and pints of this basic beer. Nice one, a tad underrated. Bobcat is located in the heart of Bristol, so Bobcat named a beer after the downtown part of Bristol, the whole 500 square feet of it.
Bobcat Cafe Downtown Brown;Bristol, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Bobcat Cafe and Brewery;Sampled from the tap at the brewpub.

Square One English Pale Ale;St. Louis, Missouri, United States;Pale Ale - English;Square One Brewery;Pours amber / copper with a light hazy and a tight off-white head. The aroma has the same damn fruitiness that almost every one of the beers from this brewery has - a light apricot with some plastic traits. There is also some sweet grapefruit, sweet malt and minor citrus hops. Medium / light body with generous soft carbonation. The flavor starts with sweet malt, band aids, nectarine and some woody / spicy hops. The finish has a bit more sourness and some spice then there is a lingering taste in the mouth of plasticy nectar fruit. Once again Square One makes a decent drinking, but incredibly middle of the road beer.

Lagunitas Kill Ugly Radio;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);Pours light golden with an orange. Aroma is pretty dead.

Lagunitas Kill Ugly Radio;Petaluma, California, United States;IPA;Lagunitas Brewing Company (Heineken);A- pours a delightful, very light copper color with a great white head that lingers for a while. Great lacing. S- beautiful hops immediately, almost reminds me of christmas. Clean hop aroma. T- Initial taste is almost fruity, very citrusy, very grapefruit. The hops are obviously present, and are balanced perfectly. M- hits the palate dead on, yet slightly confusing my tastebuds at first, but finishes very smooth. Leaves the mouth feeling a little dry, but very warming. D- If you love IIPAs, get this while you can, I was lucky to get a keg of it for my bar. Pint after pint it never gets old. Warning...this was an older review from one site to another.

Fresh grass smell T-Fresh citrus and hops with a great lasting bitterness M-light and carbonated D-Very drinkable and a great all around IPA.
Hereford & Hops Black & Tan;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On draught at the Wausau brewpub location, pours a semi-clear dark amber brew with a creamy and fast dissolving off-white head. Aroma of mild caramel malt, a touch of chocolate, toffee and citrus hops. Taste is medium bodied, light carbonation with flavors of semi-sweet caramel malt, a touch of toffee and citrus hops. Finish is slightly sweet with a lingering citrus aftertaste. Average at best, or my palate is not particular to black and tans.
Hereford & Hops Black & Tan;Escanaba, Michigan, United States;Stout;Hereford & Hops Restaurant & Brew Pub;On tap at the restaurant/brewpub in Escanaba. About 3/4 stout, 1/4 pale ale (this appears to be a combination of their Oatmeal Stout and Hop Rocket Pale/Amber). Thick, creamy buff head. The hoppy pale ale flavors kick in first, but each swirl reveals more roasted malt and chocolate. Both of the base beers are better than average, so the combined product was pretty good too.
