Empyrean Supernova;Lincoln               ,Nebraska       ,United States;California Common / Steam Beer;Empyrean Brewing Company;I tried a sample which was nice so I didn�t have to waste my money on this. Bready with sharp hop undertones. It needs refining and better balance. There is nothing really summer-y about this seasonal beer. This really just tasted unfinished and amateurish. I generally like Empyrean,but this is not a good offering from them.

Picked this 40-oz ballistic beauty up at the BP station on Union Avenue. The guy behind the counter was wearing a green polyester BP smock with ""Jerry"" embroidered on the breast, but I could tell Jerry was really Elvis. Aroma actually has some whiffs of malt in it. This wasn�t nearly as nasty as I feared from looking at the bottle. Soak a paper bag in some generic Eurolager and that�s what the flavor�s like. Finish is clumsy and quick. Light hops, medium sweetness."

Not a bad pick up when you are looking for a quick buzz.

Snake River Discombobulator Mai-Bock;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Snake River Brewing Co.;Review from either late summer 2008 or mid spring 2009, reviewed on my parents deck and somewhat shared with my pops (who I could tell wasn�t too fond of it). Poured out a clear and attractive copper brew, creamy light tan cap and amazing permanent lacing. The aroma has a great robust roasted malt front... tons of malts really. Early on the malts are almost pungent (it weakens), nice balanced sweetness from the malts, maybe even a faint smoke quality. Background nectarine and other citrus - these citrusy hops take away some of the bite of the large roasted character. The depth of flavour and it goes from roast to deep roast to dark earthy roast with a hint of peat. Somehow, with all this thick flavour, the malts are not really that rich - a richness that can kill a bock for me. Mild bitterness, a bit of fruit, light peppery spice, slight alcohol (perfect amount). Especially early on, the malts had such amazing depth, such a range of flavours that I was not sure if I liked it. But the incredible range and depth won me over very fast. Smooth, perfect. Short lived spice on the finish, tons of roasted malts. Veers from the standard bock recipe and that is why I like it so much. This beer is awesome.

Mill Street Pilsner;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Draft. Clear light brown body. The aroma is good, the taste sweet. Overall quite balanced for a style that�s hard to perfect.
Mill Street Pilsner;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Tap at the brewpub - admittedly, I did not take notes nor pay much attention to the beer. But to accompany a conversation and a burger it was very much alright, albeit a bit boring and non-memorable. Grassy, malty. Pretty nice lingering bitterness. Would probably like it more if unfiltered.
Mill Street Pilsner;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);First pint from a new keg (they had to change keg, so had to wait haha)Golden appearance. Barely any head. Good lacing. Aromas are escaping me at the moment, would say the hops are there, some grains. Some malts in flavour with weak spices, hints of cinnamon. Slight watery mouthfeel. Not much aftertaste. Pretty good on a hot day.
Mill Street Pilsner;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Despite the relatively mild colour of this beer, the bitterness of the hops was quite surprising. Althoug this may be an often enjoyed beer, it was not a personal favourite
Mill Street Pilsner;Toronto, Ontario, Canada;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Mill Street Brewery (AB InBev);Pours clear deep gold with one finger of white head diminishing gradually to a thin skim, minimal lacing. (3/5) Nose is pale bready malt, light grassy hops. (6/10) Taste is mild sweet, moderate bitter. (6/10) Light body, moderate carbonation, long bitter finish. (3/5) Bottom of the barrel - last one here, on tap or in bottles, that I haven�t tried. A fairly authentic, German-tasting pilsener. Which is to say, fairly boring. Although it�s a little dark for the style, which is fine by me, that�s not really enough to rescue it from the doldrums of mediocrity. (10/20)

Steelhead Starchild Unfiltered Pale Ale;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Basically a warm IPA. Nothing special. Hazy and unfiltered, good palate, but otherwise forgettable.

Steelhead Pacific Crest Porter;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Porter;Steelhead Brewing Co.;Kind of an under the radar beer, I missed this one in previous visits to Eugene. A delicious little porter that is on the lighter side, but has some catching flavor, with a bit of a hoppy bite that I was not expecting. Chocolate flavors become more evident as it warms. Decent
Steelhead Pacific Crest Porter;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Porter;Steelhead Brewing Co.;A great Porter that poured deep bark brown. Had a very light flavor with a stornghint of Hops at the end. Could find some chocolate that finished with the beer. Nice beer.
Steelhead Pacific Crest Porter;Eugene, Oregon, United States;Porter;Steelhead Brewing Co.;"(Draft: Steelhead Brewing Company in Eugene, OR) This is a pretty light porter. It�s somewhat dry and roasty to start, turning a bit sweeter with a prominent chocolate maltiness in the finish. The nose is quite chocolaty and roasty. Medium ""plus"" body, but carbonation levels are a bit low, so it�s a bit lifeless on the palate. Dark brown color through the center of the glass, but a ruddy light brown at the edges. Pours with absolutely no head, just a few large bubbles at the edge of the glass. I like it okay, but just not very inspirational."

Flossmoor Station Wedding Wit;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Festival tap: Cloudy yellow. Light and spicy. Nose is full of coriander and white pepper, but also hints of lemon and orange zest. Light flavor carries the spices and also offers some thin pale malt flavors. Some bitterness at the finish. Refreshing, which was the goal of this beer!

Flossmoor Station Wedding Wit;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Well they say this is a special, but there is not much that is special here. If you like Sierra Nevada Pale ale then you know exactly what this looks, smells, and tastes like. Thats all there is to say.
Flossmoor Station Wedding Wit;Flossmoor, Illinois, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery;Draft. Matt�s first foray into Belgian styles here, and the choice is a somewhat mild starter. I got the very start of the keg, and so watched the barmaid pour out a lot of foam that looked like dishwater, and the impression stuck with me. Head is thin, but still substantive. Color is the usual opaque, pale yellow for this style. Taste is surprisingly creamy, with just a hint of hop spice over the expected Belgian character. I think this is something a little closer to a Point White than a real wit.

Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can. The following is a compilation of a dozen peoples� thoughts who shared this brew with me at my first (and perhaps last?) Malt Liquor Dexterity Games Tournament to celebrate my birthday. Keeping in mind that most of the participants are not regular beer raters, here we go: light gold, corn and solvent, industrial and harsh, check this one off, bears of steel, I�m refusing to participate anymore, tastes like rat poison, kidney failure is in sight, I literally can�t taste anymore, no no nope no, keep your reserve I don�t want it.
Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can. Clear pale yellow pour, with a fizzy white head. Corn, sweetness, old bread, and alcohol. Not as offensive as the regular SR. Mmmm boy
Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can is cool, that�s the appearance. The smell is stale old malt, bland grain, and sweet moldy corn. Taste is pretty much the same. Maybe a bit rougher than regular SR. Damn
Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);710ml can. Drank straight form the vessel after being trasferred to the freezer for an hour after the fridge. Whale-type malt in chicago. BB May1616. Smell is okay, definitely smells corny, label be damned. Flavor is very HGish, but quite clean though, the finish si smoother than many hgs, corny and boozy but without a huge acetone quality. Alsoone of the more expensive ones, the storeowner thought it was some kind of ipa 3.00 for this sucker.
Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is good beer easy to drink smooth with lots of malty flavor. would recommend
Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);slow brewed? ok. another slummer, for less than $2. Again slightly better than the horrid SR211 (NON triple export :)) but still pretty bad. Corn and alcohol. Not skunky, but not good.
Steel Reserve 211 Triple Export;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"24 oz. can from AdamT (""Thanks""?). Well, it looks nice with a golden pour and a pillowy white head. Aroma of sweet corn and lemony hops. Tastes like college at some lame keg party where quantity wins over quality. Even in the malt liquor world this is bad."

Red Squirrel Stout;Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, England;Stout;Mad Squirrel Brewing;"Bright bottled @ Cambridge Fest. Fresh notes: ""Huge chocolate stout with a refreshing red berry crispness, though the finish is a bit muddled. Score: 2.8"" Well this has also matured nicely. The first gulps were really dark and bitter, more like an Irish Stout, but then the palate adjusts and the red fruits soften things down and allow the chocolate flavours to be enjoyed. Finish is still a bit muddled. Nice dark red colour. Muddled aroma."
McMenamins May Day Mild;Portland, Oregon, United States;Mild Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;on tap in eugene. i was pretty impressed by this one, certainly was a pretty good impression of a mild. aroma of dried caramel, dried dogfood and a little bit of swimming pool. lightly roasted, quite salty, nice hard water and long powder dry finish

Teerenpeli Mahtimikko;Lahti, Finland;Stout;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;Draught @ teerenpeli. I don�t know, I didn�t enjoy this very much. It looks much better than it actually is, very dark and surprisingly dark foam also. Very little carbonation. A stout... but it tastes like ashes blended into a dry apple cider. Very sour in acidic and citric kind of way, dry and bitter. I could almost feel the ashes between my teeth, which is a very unpleasant feel. Kind a horrible to speak the truth.
Teerenpeli Mahtimikko;Lahti, Finland;Stout;Teerenpeli Panimo & Tislaamo;Draught @ Kekri, Gallows Bird, Finland. Thick meidum-brown head, black colour. Ashes in the aroma! Nto bad at all, Bitterness in the taste, very stouty. Good.

Quite full-bodied, oily palate with very low carbonation and a short, bitter finish. Long and pleasant licorice aftertaste. An excellent brew, but more like a porter.
Sleeping Lady Gold Rush Golden Ale;Anchorage, Alaska, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Sleeping Lady Brewing Co.;"on tap @ Snow Goose / Anchorage AK --- Clear straw amber color, white rim head, big cobwebs of lace.

Rich and flavorful, albeit on the sweet side. Had notes of chocolate, dark toast, sweet grains and creamed coffee. Smooth and milky on the tongue with a lactic-like sweetness.

Glacier Golden Grizzly Ale;Polson, Montana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Glacier Brewing Company;From bottle, the pour is clear reddish blond work a off white head that thins after in less than a min. The aroma is yeast and earthy. The taste is almost reminiscent of chicken noodle soup, when you finish this when you get that remaining oil on back of tongue. A little strange.
Glacier Golden Grizzly Ale;Polson, Montana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Glacier Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from $10,000 Bar in Montana. Aroma is doughy, grain, creamed corn, toast. Pours clear golden with a long sustaining bone white head and some lace. Taste is malty sweet, somewhat grainy. Too sweet with not enough hop bitterness.
Glacier Golden Grizzly Ale;Polson, Montana, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Glacier Brewing Company;Poured from bottle into a pint glass Appearance � The beer pours light golden color with a tiny white head. The head fades very fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell � The aroma is light overall, but consists of a little bit of a caramel smell as well as a hint of a bready aroma. A tiny bit of grass is there as well, rounding it all out. Taste � The taste begins with a caramel and bready taste along with a hint of a light fruity taste of a apple, peach, and pear nature. The fruit and caramel fade a bit as the taste moves on, all while the bready grows more intense and is joined by a bit of a corn sweetness. In the end with a hint of a grassy hop coming to the tongue, one is left with a moderately sweet and bready flavor to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel � The body of the beer is on the average side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the style it is rather appropriate and makes for an easy drinker. Overall- Nothing too special here, an alright pale ale, but nothing more.

Randalls Island Gold;St Peter Port, Guernsey;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Randalls Brewery;Keg at the Ommaroo Hotel, St Helier, Jersey. Foamy gold with forced head. This was a shocker, all that is wrong with kegged beer and yet I don�t think it was meant to be kegged. Flat flavours, corny, cardboard, fuddled. Drank whilst watching some miserable guy on a guitar, dear o dear.
Randalls Island Gold;St Peter Port, Guernsey;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Randalls Brewery;A golden ale from Guernsey�s single remaining brewer, which rarely escapes the island, so I was really pleased to be able to sample two Randalls beers in the same session. Although this is clearly intended to be a refreshing blonde beer, it is not entirely successful. The aroma is rather sulphurous and, whilst there is some hop flavour it is not really that clean or crisp. Dry finish. Perfectly drinkable, if uninspiring. Cask (gravity), Cambridge Beer festival
Rockingham Saxon Cross;Elton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rockingham Ales;Cask conditioned Gravity dispense Northants BF 2010. An amber coloured beer with a dry husky aroma. There is also some fruit and nut in the nose. Fruity and slightly vinuous in the mouth. Fruitcake flavours. Slightly sweet. Interesting and nice.
Rockingham Saxon Cross;Elton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rockingham Ales;"I was pleased to get the opportunity to try this as the brewery only operates part time, at weekends, and its beers are not often seen.. This is their ""best bitter"" and has an attractive reddish amber/copper colour. Noticeably yeasty rustic malt aroma, with toffee undertones. An unusual mixture of bready malt and citric hops on the palate. Dry, but slightly tart finish. Quite pleasant, with some complexity, but I�m not convinced that the elements are as well integrated as they might be. And it is all a bit undermined by a somewhat thin body. Despite this, I rather liked this beer for reasons I can�t quite work out. Cask (gravity), Cambridge Beer Festival."

Savanna Light Premium Cider;Stellenbosch, South Africa;Apple Cider;Distell Group Limited;330 ml bottle from South Africa. Ingredients: Appel cider, Fruit & Maize Sugar. Cider starts mild-watery. First it tastes like cider, a bit light, but fruity and ok. But then it changes to a undefinable bitter-strange taste that had something from whomit. not nice aftertaste... --> could have been nice, but ends ugly... --> 6/10/4/5
Savanna Light Premium Cider;Stellenbosch, South Africa;Apple Cider;Distell Group Limited;"330ml bottle bought at ParkNShop Superstore in Fanling. Clear pale golden yellow colour; Razor thin head and soapy residual white foam which fades in 15 seconds; Small sticky lacing and active carbonation; Sour smell of apple juice, yoghurt water, very light sparkling white wine and faint hint of wood; Very light sweet and moderate tart taste of thin sparkling white wine, light apple juice, wet cardboard, light wood and light tannic; Light body, quite dry and watery palate. Mouth feel is quite dry and moderate, cheap sour-tasting macro cider, which is less watery than Savanna Dry but still light weight. The lager-like wet cardboard, light as it may be, is still unexpected and annoying. Lesser sweet and wood taste is bugging. Sour and wet cardboard finish. Bad! Quite dry after taste, easy but carbonated to mouth. Comments: I really question the rationale of having the �light� style for beer and cider. It didn�t works for most beers, and sure enough it doesn�t work for this one: it has ironically a richer body and palate than Savanna Dry, but the cheapo sour taste and wet cardboard kills off whatever merits it may have. Drain pour after half a glass, and stay away from the dodgy Savanna!"
Savanna Light Premium Cider;Stellenbosch, South Africa;Apple Cider;Distell Group Limited;33cl bottle. Very light gold color. Very thin head. Medium to high carbonation. Sweetness is medium and sourness is low. Quite simple apple aroma.
Victory Vienna Lager;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"This is one of the absolute most approachable beers I�ve experienced. With all the recent conversations about approachable, easy going transition beers I wanted to start off by saying this definitely falls in that category. Appearance: Typical for the style. It is a pale golden color, completely translucent. Head fades fast and leaves no lacing. Smell: Musty and sweet right up front. It is gently malty with a clear presence of some hops but it is just laid back and relaxed. Taste: The taste is the same way. Laid back and relaxed. This beer is interesting and good to taste but is remarkably easy to just drink with out thinking. The lightly toasted malts have a barley caramelized attribute to them. The hops character does not want you to notice it; so well balanced and simply supporting the overall affect of the beer on the palate. There is a bit of homemade bread or dough attribute as well, maybe that is what subconsciously says take off your shoes, sit on the porch and enjoy the hell out of me. Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. this style tends to be very crisp and this one is light crispy and only gently bitter in the dry aftertaste. A bit more slick than some. Drinkability: Many of the characteristics of this beer may seem reserved. It may not be as �big� as some of you my prefer, but it is remarkably easy, one of the most enjoyable session beers I can think of. Hope this is helpful. Cheers!"

Victory Vienna Lager;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);TAP: light nose, gold color, foamy head.

Victory Vienna Lager;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Fruity (starfruit?) and bready (whole grain) hops and malts, balanced, mouthfeel a tad chewy, but hops are too citric for a vienna. They didn�t quite fit the bill. Color is light orange-yellow and the alcohol is higher than expected--they did a good job hiding it.
Victory Vienna Lager;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Light amber, very clear with moderate white fluffy head and good lacing. Not as hoppy overall as some vienna�s and very strong. However the strength is hidden very well and only hits you after 2 beers. Very malty and bready with a medium motuhfeel. Exceptionally drinkable for a strong lager.

Achel Extra Blond (Achelse Zomer 2004);Hamont-Achel, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij der Trappistenabdij De Achelse Kluis;"The forerunner of the still hard-to-get Achel Extra Blond, basically a weaker version of only 8.5% ABV. Made as a one-off for the birthday of the abbott of Achelse Kluis in 2004; I drove to the monastery especially for this. Came in a 75 cl bottle with a sobre hangtag. Egg-white, irregular, sticky and thickly lacing head, colour a warm peach blonde, misty with beautiful fizz throughout. Rich aroma, in which I will never forget the fruitiness: it was like sticking your nose in a basket of exotic fruits. Hints of fresh orange juice, mango, papaja, banana, mint, candi sugar, baker�s yeast, Moscatel wine, coriander, aniseed, apple, peach, grass. Utterly fruity onset, refreshing, supple, full bready maltiness, spicy yeast, sugary sweetness sticking a bit but nevertheless balanced with a leafy hop bitterness. Sweeter than Achel 8 Blond, but a lot more �festive� and luxurious too. Curious to find out how it relates to its successor Achel 9.5 Extra Blond."

Cassels Dabinett SV Cider (Draught);Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Apple Cider;Cassels Cider;A single varietal cider made with a very traditional English cider apple variety. I can normally appreciate the merits of hard cider, but struggled with this one. Searingly dry, no real fruit character apparent. Sour and rather sulphurous. Is it mean to taste like this. If so, I�m not impressed. Gravity, Cambridge Beer Festival. (4/2/4/2/8) RE-RATE. April 2006. Still searingly dry. Still has an eggy whiff in the aroma. Woody and a bit austere. I scored it higher this time but I�m not sure whethere I was just being particularly niggardly on the previous occasion. I�ll give it the benefit of the doubt and retian the higher mark.
Brasserie du Pays d'Oc Naevius Bio;Nebian, France;Flavored - Other;Pays d'Oc (Caroux);"Fully funky beer, orange; slight gushing, resulting in 2 cm beer underneath 20 cm dense yellow head, fed by heavy carbonation. Sourish, very lactic nose as a Flemish Oud Bruin, bit wood, very slight solvent, but mainly lactic acid and lineseed. Sourish, lactic, vinous, faint citrus. I�m sorry, but I like this very much - this is actually great (though I might regret it tomorrow). Soft lactic sourness, fruity. In the finish, dry woodiness with a touch of solvent; Very refreshing, titillating. I feel like on a very slippery slope. Philippe, was THIS what you drank? If so, I�m going to experience it tomorrow. Very big thanks to Gunter March for bringing this!"
Brasserie du Pays d'Oc Naevius Bio;Nebian, France;Flavored - Other;Pays d'Oc (Caroux);A hazy orange beer with a huge bubbly head. The aroma is sour as if it were wildfermented - I wonder if it were over the top. The flavor was also like it had been wildfermented with a wood dry finish.

Alpine Beer Company Crazy Hazel;Alpine, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Poured up on tap at the Alpine brewpub where it has a clear amber body with copper edges and supporting an off white head. The aroma is a little nutty with mild floral like hoppiness around the edges. The taste delivers some caramel malts, slightly roasted malts and near sweet nuttiness. Behind the malts I get slivers of spicy to floral hop bitterness.
Alpine Beer Company Crazy Hazel;Alpine, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Taster at the brewpub. Pours a copper-gold color with a small white head that soon recedes to a fine film. The aroma is mild with sweet bread, and possibly some faint nuttiness. The flavor is overtly sweet, with candied nuts and bready malts. The palate is light but appropriate. Finishes short and sweet.

Alpine Beer Company Crazy Hazel;Alpine, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alpine Beer Company (CA);On tap at Alpine Brewpub. Pour is a dark reddish amber with a fairly thin head that clings very nicely. Chose is mostly bready malts and yeast. Maybe a very faint Hazelnut. Taste follows the nose and very smooth and sessionable. No hazelnut on the taste. Certainly will not confuse this for Nutella. Very good beer on it�s own even if it wasn�t what I expected
Alpine Beer Company Crazy Hazel;Alpine, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Clear amber with a perfect creamy off-white head. Loads of fresh hazelnut, vanilla, coffee, and a hint of chocolate in the nose. Could smell this one all day! Rich flavors of all of the above, but a slight hint of hops offers balance to keep it from being sweet. Full-bodied, very creamy, soft carbonation, lengthy nutella (chocolate & hazelnut) finish. Great stuff. It veers off the typical California hop path which makes it that much more fun to try. Thanks again Scotty V!

Lucky Labrador Pavlovs Russian Imperial Stout;Portland, Oregon, United States;Stout - Imperial;Lucky Labrador Brewing Company;I tried this sweet deliciousness on tap during a brewery tour around Portland, OR. Out of several brewery samples around the city, this came in as my favorite beer. It poured thick, black and rich with a dark tan head. Taste had notes of brown sugar, caramel, coffee, and oak. Beautiful finish-lightly sweet and balanced. The taste lingered on my palate and left me looking forward to the next sip. The higher alcohol content didn�t make this beer too rich either as I�ve experienced time and time again. I wasn�t an imperial stout drinker before this beer, but I have been trying to find one that compares since.

Nose is of fruits and some roasted malt. Not sure I could identify the fruits here, though. Some sweet caramel as well.

Overall an OK amber ale, not something I usually seek out. It is surprisingly light on fruit flavors for a fruit beer...

A complicated aroma, strong and malty with roasted caramal notes and a finishing spiced nose of orange zest. The mouth feel is quite carbonated and the flavouring is again complicated.

Fox Cerberus Norfolk Stout;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Stout;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottle. A dark, dark brown beer with a nice tan head. Looking really good in the glass. Bonfire-sour, burnt aroma with charcoal and some coffee. Nice, but too burnt for my likings. The flavor folllows the same path, with bonfire sourness, charcoal, burnt malt, some coffee and a coffee-like bitterness. Long, burnt finish. Dry and full-bodied. A quite nice burnt beer, but I would like some hops playing a part too. (080823)

Fox IPA;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Cask (Devonshire Cat, Sheffield) - Golden in colour. Earthy hops and dried fruit in the aroma. The taste is quite strange with earthy hops and biscuity malt being most noticeable. Am not sure if it�s meant to be like this, but it�s a bit odd.

Light semi soft and semi dry palate. Minerally light malt dominates the hops which present mild grapefruit bitterness and a little orange peeping through.

Long bitter finish of crackers, nuts, wet grass and orange-peels with acidic undertones of immature nectarines. A robust fruity ale which has signs of infection.
Fox IPA;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottle, shared by fonefan. A hazy, orange beer with a small beige head. Dusty, citrusy aroma, but with enough malt and hops to save it from being totally off. Some citrusy-sour flavors, with fruity hops and bitterness doing the rest of the job. Malty flavors almost completely hidden by the others. Medium body. Fruity and bitter finish. Sure, it�s a drinkable and quite refreshing beer, but very boring and not very IPA-ish. (080822)

Fox Punt Gun;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Porter;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottled. A deep red beer with a slight haze under a huge tan head. The aroma is sweet wtih strong notes of chocolate, and light notes of coffee and an edge of acidity. The flavor is sweet with notes of chocolate and cocoa beans, as well as a slight acidity - does it stem from the roasted malt or a slight infection? I think the latter. Thanks to fonefan and Brugmansia for sharing.
Fox Punt Gun;Heacham, Norfolk, England;Porter;Fox Brewery (Norfolk);Bottle, shared by fonefan. It pours a beautiful ruby-brown body, unclear, with a nice, lasting beige head. Roasted malt, dried fruits and, unfortunately, a little sourness and dusty impression. It has a medium full body, with flavors of roasted malt, coffee, some citric sourness and a coffee-like bitterness. The finish is coffee-bitter too, and also has a fruity hoppyness. A quite nice one. I�m not surprised by sourness in an old ale, but the sourness found here is the kind you find in a beer going bad. Fortunately, it wasn�t running the show. ( 080822)
Italian Oasis Cannon Amber;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Italian Oasis Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the brewpub as part of a four-style sampler. The pour is amber-copper with an off-white lingering head and medium clarity. The nose is sweet marrying caramel malts with toffee and butterscotch esters. Hops played down. The body was medium. The taste is just as sweet as the aroma with a mild but clean hop finish. I liked this one the best of the four I tried.
Italian Oasis Cannon Amber;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Italian Oasis Restaurant & Brewery;On tap at the source as part of a sampler. Comes to the table a cloudy medium amber color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is toffee and caramel with hints of chocolate and a light earthy hop. The flavor is sweet with a bready toffee base with hints of caramel and chocolate and some faint earthy hops providing some balance. Medium to light body with a light level of carbonation, and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. This was the pick of the litter today as it had the least amount of off flavors. Mediocre at best but provided the greatest drinkability.
Italian Oasis Cannon Amber;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Italian Oasis Restaurant & Brewery;on tap-pours a rich tan head that laces and cloudy orange/brown color. Aroma is mild sweet medium malt, slight spice hops. Taste is sweet medium malt-caramel, some spice hops, yeast. Medium/full body.
Italian Oasis Cannon Amber;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Italian Oasis Restaurant & Brewery;In short: A dirty muddy yeasty mess with overripe fruits. Problematic. How: Tap at brewpub The look: Ugly cloudy dirty dark orange body topped by a small beige head In long: The light aroma shows a yeasty character with some ripe overripe fruits. Taste is very yeasty, dirty caramel, a wet cereals sensation, extra-ripe citrus, doughy. This is far from a crisp clean beer. This feels like a muddy yeasty dirty mess. Italian Oasis is not a great brewpub but they can do better, the stout was quite drinkable, but the Cannon is not their big gun.
Italian Oasis Cannon Amber;Littleton, New Hampshire, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Italian Oasis Restaurant & Brewery;My Bottom Line: Caramel sweetness provides a plump body for this muddled Amber Ale, as herbal, earthy hops offer a bit more bitterness than their Moore Dam has. Further Personal Perceptions: -A ring of foam tops the murky amber. -The flavor profile, like all beers I had there that day, was a tad chaotic. -Carbonation was smooth, but the dextrins took too much room, ultimately hindering drinkability. -Malts do not offer a lot of different flavors. On tap at the brewpub.

Cambridge East Side ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cambridge Brewing Company;From cask. Great hop aroma. Caramel body with white head. Taste is just a more bland version of the smell.
Cambridge East Side ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cambridge Brewing Company;On cask: Dry hopped with Cascade This offering pours a cloudy dark maroon with hardly any visable light. It leaves a creamy thick tan head that stays with this brew. The smell is fantastic fresh earthy hops like taking a big breath of a hand full of hops. The taste starts smooth with hop bitterness balanced by a creamy, caramel, mouthfeel that finishes sweet with a herbal presence. This is a another solid offering from the CBC.
Cambridge East Side ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cambridge Brewing Company;on draft at the brewpub. a bit different then the traditional british esb. definately an american version with more noble hops pushing. moderate malt flavors with almost a woody taste. much like all the beers at cambridge pretty much middle of the road and good drinkn.
Cambridge East Side ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cambridge Brewing Company;Tap at the brewery. Amber color, medium head. Moderately hoppy aroma. Medium body, a hoppy version of the style, (not to the extent of Brutal Bitter though). This is one style that I really just can�t describe very well, beyond that it has a mildly sweet earthy body. But I do know that this is a very enjoyable and well made beer.
Cambridge East Side ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cambridge Brewing Company;2004 cask @ the brewery. Served a moderately brownish-amber, slightly transluscent with a small but persistent off-white head. Aroma of sweet brown bread, brown sugar a touch of toasted earthiness and plenty of spicy hops (perle). Flavor is right away sweet and malty (caramel and rich toffee) with a good dose of spicy and only lightly bitter hops. Very creamy consistency, but enough carbonation to keep things interesting. Ever so light fruit esters on the finish, with more hops and malt mixed together. I thouroughly enjoyed this one.
Cambridge East Side ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Cambridge Brewing Company;Light amber in color with a small white head and large loose bubbles.Floral hop aroma. Flavor is hoppy with a sweet caramel malt character.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;Enjoyed at GTMW 2012. Pours a bright amber with a medium cream head. Smells of caramelized sugar and dried fruit. Sweet and mildly metallic taste with a caramel cream finish.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Candy sweet berry and light malt aroma, Deep amber with a small head. Berry, alcohol, and hops flavor...a little on the harsh side. Medium body.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft at source. Raspberry, barley malt and alcohol aroma. Dark amber color with small head. Sweet raspberry and barley malt flavor with a strong alcohol and bitter herbal/orange peel hops finish. Very unique - extremely hoppy.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;on draft at richo�s 2006 gravity head. the beer had been aging for about a year. clear dark amber with no head. great aroma. very balanced hops and nutty sweet malt. huge barley wine flavor. bittersweet and nutty with some tobacco notes. body very full and thick with a long sweet but hoppy finish. the gravity head program billed this as a double ipa or a barley wine. i would definitely put this in the barley wine category. it reminds me of old crusty. this is one huge beer.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;(draft) Looked and smelled fantastic - good enough that I pushed past my initial dislike of the taste to give it a fair shot. Eventually the bitterness wore me out, and I ended up giving about half the pint away. I can understand the appeal of this beer, it just doesn�t happen to appeal to me.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized light brown colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a transparent softly carbonated light brown colored body and a good lacing. The aroma was mild and hoppy with a Irish red note to it. The mouth feel was strong vinous and hoppy with a lingering finish of strong hoppy malty flavors.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft at Rich O�s in New Albany, IN. Poured a small tan head, excellent lacing, opaque, no visible carbonation, and an orange red hue. Hoppy, earthy, sweet, pineapple aroma. Sweet, sour, tart, hoppy flavor with a somewhat lingering aftertaste. Mouthfeel was tart and sour.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;"Draft - this is a crazy beer! Michael - the brewer - told me that they took this one to the GABF, but weren�t sure which category to put it in. The brewery could care less about ""styles"". They put it in as a DIPA, but one judge commented that had it been listed as an English Barleywine it would likely have medaled! A funky nose - caramel sweetness, brown sugar and hops and hops! Fairly standard appearance. Dirty gold with an off white head. Delicious flavor! Hoppy, funky and dangerous! This was an aged sample that hid the 10.5% very well. Be careful!"
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub. Thick, opaque amber-copper, lots of floaties..like river water after a flood. Massive, sweet, pungent and hoppy nose, very green and juicy. Extremely rough and very strange, with odd pineapple sweet/sourness, a bit of milk, whiskey and wet herbs. Not sure exactly how I feel about this one, it is so untutored and undeveloped yet bold and exciting...another wild one served to me by Mike straight from the fermenter. What a crazy beer.
New Albanian Stumble Bus;New Albany, Indiana, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;New Albanian Brewing Company;Draft at Fest: Deep copper hue with frothy head and good lace. The aroma has notes of pineapple, grapefruit, ornage zest, hop leafs, floral, earthy, and pipe tobacco. The taste has a crisp bitter and sweet fruit nature. Becomes more hoppy has you drink it. There is a good caramel malt balance and a nice earthy tone that finished dry and astringent. The feel is slightly warming and has a bite. Wow, another surprising beer from this brewery. They really need to find a way to bottle their beers. This hybrid IIPA is another must try!
Victory Dark Mild;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);Had this last fall. Copper colored with aroma of caramel malt, almond, toffee, some cabernet. Solid complexity and balance.
Victory Dark Mild;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);"The ""Mild"" is available cask from the brewery for a limited time after a batch of V12 is produced... Poured a clear copper color with a tight white head and nice lacing. Nutty, toasty, lightly fruity aroma. Taste was caramel malt, light nuts, and a funky hop flavor. Thin, rather refreshing, but very dry almost sour. Much less fruity than the regular mild."
Victory Dark Mild;Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States;Mild Ale;Victory Brewing Company (ABV);I was told that this was the second runnings from the mash of the V12 with a little chocolate malt thrown in. I also had it from the hand pump which made a great beer even better. Beeeautiful head. Thick and creamy. Medium copper body. The aroma is butter and maple. The same carries through into the flavor is a little nuttiness and fruit. It�s like a stack of pancakes without the full belly. Awesome mild.
Salamander D Day;Bradford, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salamander;Specially brewed for the 60th anniversary of the D Day landings. Cask Conditioned, White Horse Hedgerley, gravity dispense, poured by me. Another brilliant golden bitter in the typical Salmander style. These beers are so drinkable, with their mixture of citric hops and refreshing fruitiness. Brilliant.
Banks and Taylor Special Dark;Shefford, Bedfordshire, England;Stout;B&T Brewery;Cask Conditioned, White Horse Hedgerley, gravity dispense, poured by me. A decent enough beer, mild flavour, sort of sweet, little roastyness. Pretty good.
Archers Sweet FA;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned at The Stags Head, Dunster, Somerset. Brown amber with bubbly head. Sweetish malty bitter with a thinnish flavour. A little cereal note on the finish with some apple notes. Middling Bitter.
Archers Sweet FA;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Archers (Evan Evans);Specially brewed for the Euro 2004 tournament. Cask Conditioned, White Horse Hedgerley, gravity dispense, poured by me. Sweet, malty, and with a biting bitterness to the underside of the tongue. Decent enough with 1/2 a pint, I can imagine it could be cloying after a few pints.
Wharfedale Wot u Like;Skipton, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Wharfedale Brewery (Skipton);Cask Conditioned, White Horse Hedgerley, gravity dispense, poured by me. Ok bitter, but overly roasty malt. I don�t like the roast flavours in a bitter, it doesn�t mix well with the hops.
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;really not beer. low body apple sweet and mildly like vinegar. strong honey taste is not complementary to the whole presentation. demonstrative yes, it demonstrates bad beer.
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;"Super clear very light golden coloured body with absolutely no head nor bubbles or any sort of life. Funky aroma of malt, vinegar, lemon zest, rice and a faint bit of sugars. Light-bodied; Strong carbonation up front with a very very mild malty flavour and a short taste of honey. Aftertaste shows a lot of water with some light sweetness going on. Overall, a pretty bad beer...but kind of to be expected. This one really isn�t worth trying, but then again, I�d try another one from them if I could find it! I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Oliver�s Beverages in Albany, New York on 08-April-2006 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia."
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Bottle. Pours weak yellow with an aroma of mineral spirits. Flavor is a weird paint mixture with a bizarre fruit essence. Average mouthfeel. Forgettable.
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;[bottle - 12 oz] Clear and pale yellow with not much head. Some small amount of bubbles. Aroma is candy sweet with hints of honey and some molasses. Flavor is about two seconds worth of honey sweetness, then nothing. The flavor disappears quickly and leaves an aftertaste of watered-down whiskey and plastic. A mead? Not quite sure about that.
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;bottle. pale yellow almost no head. honey and molasses aroma. thin body, high carbonation, cheap white wine flavor. im glad i hauled this one home from ny. foulness in a bottle.
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Bought this on the specialty shelf, would never have guessed this was a mead. I bought it thinking it was gluten free beer. Pale yellow ubiquitous appearance. Smells like whiskey and water. A little carbonation on the palate, never knew meads had carbonation. Taste is like watered down immature homemade dago wine, with a little fizz. Finish is like whiskey and water on melted ice.
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;"Has a twist off cap with the words ""gluten free"" tagged on it. Pours a goldeny gold with a goldish tinge. Smells like weird. Tastes like a light lager with some extra sweet and sour sauce in it. I guess it�s ok, but usually this is the kind of novelty item that I would PASS OVER. Haha! Get it?"
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Yeah. I bought it for the novelty. Pours a clear gold with a decent sized white head at first that falls fairly quickly. Also there are some massive chunks of sediment that I did not expect to have in the bottle, so they ended up in my glass as I just poured everything in. Oops. Nose is like melted or burnt plastic. There is a touch of honey there, but not enough to impress. Flavor is like tart honey and lemon juice. Horrible. I doubt I get through two sips of this. Feel is thick with huge bubbles on it. I almost want to say this tastes like cheap champagne. Not drinkable at all. Avoid. This may have been supervised and blessed by a rabbi, but I doubt that God is going to be giving His thumbs up.
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;12 oz bottle. I picked up a few of these for a gluten-intolerant friend... she then accused me of trying to kill her. Goddamn, this stuff is nasty. Hazy pale amber. Rancid aroma of motor oil, dirty fusely higher alcohols and cheap honey. Flavour is cidery, band-aidy with notes of burned rubber. So many off-flavours that it�s tough to decide whether or not to list them or just let the numbers speak for themselves.
Ramapo Valley Passover Honey Beer;Hilburn, New York, United States;Mead - Braggot/Hopped;Ramapo Valley Brewery;I really want to hate this but I can�t. It�s actually very striking to look at ... crystal clear golden with a frothy head and great (if quickly escaping) carbonation. Looks like a Martinelli filtered apple cider. Nose of floral hops and honey. Taste of floral hops and honey and apple ... if not for the hops I would have thought this was hard cider mixed with mead. OK mouthfeel. Actually drinks OK for a mead, pretty disappointing for a lager.
Bartrams Suffolk Spring;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Bartrams;Cask Conditioned, White Horse Hedgerley, gravity dispense, poured by me. Pretty good, sweet, some roastyness. Well balanced, but not an ideal spring beer!
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Looks like a dark rootbeer, and even has a sprucy hop note in the aroma, with some chocolate. The taste is sour cocoa and malt, with oxidized sweetness into the finish. Not too happy with this one. $2/12oz
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Creamy porter. Dark brown some light getting through nice creamy off white head. Smell is caramel some chocolate. Taste is sweet and gets deeper ending with a nice roast on the back end. very nice.
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Pour with a dark brown and small tan head. Aroma was sweet dark chocolate. Taste nice dark chocolate with an unexpected very pleasant sweetness and just a touch of a citrusy note. Mouthfeel was rich and satisfying. The finish was bittersweet chcolate and roast.
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Pours two fingers of head on a medium brown colored body. The aroma is pine, chocolate and roasted malt. A wonderful mixture. The taste is pine bitterness with roasted malt and dark chocolate rounding it out. The level of bitterness is uncharacteristic for the style but it fit well. The texture is smooth with a crisp finish and moderate carbonation with a little fizz in the middle. A great porter with a unique twist.
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;On draught at fanno creek nano beer fest - pours cloudy tan with thick off white head. Nose of caramel and roasted malt. Taste is of full malt with sweet caramel and coffee. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Bottle. Light chocolate nose, with a bit of coffee, and honey on toast. Dull cloudy brown dishwater color (ugly, in fact). Light roast, chocolate, grainy, some decent hopping, and a bit too much yeast / mid maintains this / finish is lightly bitter. Light body. Overhopped for the body. Very pale and clear. Not really much of a porter.
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Draught. Pours an extremely cloudy brown color with a moderate white head on it. Nose is very roasty with some nice coffee elements to it. Taste has some very similar elements to the nose, with the coffee roasting coming through in a very smooth manner.
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;Goes wonderfully with Mexican style scrambled eggs (seitan chorizo, cheese, avocado).
Terminal Gravity Breakfast Porter;Enterprise, Oregon, United States;Porter;Terminal Gravity Brewing Company;12 ounce bottle thanks to Mike. Pours a cloudy dark amber colo with a medium tan head.

Oregon Trail Bourbon Barrel Porter - Blackberry;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Oregon Trail Brewery;Draft sample at the brewery. The nose is instant blackberry, in an extract/artificial way. The porter characteristic is more evident in this one than in the black wito, and the bourbon barrel brett-like qualities are not as easily noticed. It�s more of a semi-sweet, mildly bland fruit flavored porter with an unneccesary sour note in there as well. Interesting if nothing else.
Oregon Trail Bourbon Barrel Porter - Blackberry;Corvallis, Oregon, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Oregon Trail Brewery;Brew was on tap at the Sasquatch brew festival in Eugene,OR. This beer was on tap at the Sasquatch brew festival in Eugene,OR. This beer was very hard for me to judge. Im sure many people would really rave about this beer, but a fruit porter just didn�t do it for me. Pours a dark brown color with a small off-white head. Aroma was very intense and amazing, chocolate and blackberry aroma, almost wine-like, really reminded me of the Sam Adams Triple Bock i had a while back. This brew was very carbonated and with the blackberry taste almost reminded me of a berry soda, hence my dislike. Very prominant fruit flavors, if you really like fruit beers give this a try, if you can find it.
Big Horse Horse with No Name;Hood River, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Big Horse Brewing;Ruby copper with light islands of head & a ring of lacing. Aroma is full of caramel, fairly low aroma hops and some faint roast. The flavor is balanced, semi-sweet with a dry tail, medium body.

Maple Leaf Brown Girl Ale;Wilmington, Vermont, United States;Brown Ale;Maple Leaf Malt & Brewing Company;Brewed by Long Trail now and is last beer for this Tavern. This was poured into a pint glass. The appearance was a hazy to transparent brown color. Light carbonation could be seen showing through the haziness. Even with a bar pour, a one finger white foamy head started and dissipated nicely. Nice ringy lacing. The smell had some nutty cakiness to it. Light roast. The taste was mainly sweet with a light roast to it. Wants to be balanced but really isn�t. On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a big sessionability about it. Carbonation felt a bit lighter than usual. Bitterness hits just a tad more than expected for an American Brown Ale. Overall, just an okay brown ale.

Liberator Oatmeal Stout;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Liberator Brewing;Nice dark color with a tan head that beckoned to be tried, which I did. Very chewy with a sugary, fruity tones. Finished with a strong alcohol backlash that will take you by surpirse. I enjoyed this with my sauage sampler.
Liberator Oatmeal Stout;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Liberator Brewing;(Draft: Liberator Brewing in Troutdale, OR) Much higher in alcohol than the typical offering in this style, but the alcohol in no way shows up in the flavor. Unfortunately, much of what I expect in an Oatmeal Stout doesn�t show up in this beer. It�s actually fairly tart, reminiscent of their off-the-wall cherry dunkel, and it makes you wonder if the dunkel was on the line previously and they didnt�t clean the lines properly. Oatmeal is pretty light overall, and frankly, so is the flavor. Possibly the lightest flavored and lamest oatmeal stout I�ve tasted. Dark, ruddy brown color. As expected by this point, the head fades so quickly and completely that I can�t even tell what color it is, so obviously retention and lacing are poor. Okay as beer goes, but pretty bad for an oatmeal stout.
Liberator Oatmeal Stout;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Liberator Brewing;Deep brown color. Thick and sweet licorice and candy sugar, sticky and cloying with molasses, but not much oatmeal being tasted. Strong fruit/cherries and wine flavor and aroma. Very interesting.
Liberator Oatmeal Stout;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Liberator Brewing;Very dark burgundy. Mild carbonation. Heavy sweetness (molasses and toffee) kind of takes the stage from the beginning, and it never really gives it up to anything else. Although, there were some nice notes of wood and whiskey that popped up here and there, which I enjoyed. But the milky sweetness was a little much for me.
Liberator Oatmeal Stout;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Liberator Brewing;Black color. Small head. Aroma is chocolate and toffee. A medium bodied oatmeal stout. Malts are roasted and very sweet. Lots of molasses, brown sugar, touches of whisky barrel. Seems a little lactic. Very smooth taste. This beer is missing the roasty malts are the chewyness of an oatmeal stout. Nice tasting beer but it seems more of an imperial porter than a stout. Alcohol is present. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Liberator Oatmeal Stout;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Liberator Brewing;RBSG 2004: Clear ruby with no head. Bubble-gum and plum in the aroma, with a tiny bit of alcohol. Starts and ends sweet, full bodied with an oily texture.

Liberator Oatmeal Stout;Troutdale, Oregon, United States;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Liberator Brewing;Tap. Milky-sweet and quite good at 9.5% ABV. Cherry and other misc. fruits in the flavor. Not so much of an oatmeal stout, but for an imperial, it�s a winnah.

Wolf Pack Culters Helles;West Yellowstone, Montana, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Wolf Pack Brewing Co;Sampled at the NABA 06 Fest: Golden color, no head or lacing. Served way too cold as it takes a couple minutes of swirling and warming to get even a hint of nose. The flavor is woody with a light thin sweet malt note. So subtle and delicate but thin and unappealing at the same time. There�s nothing wrong with a lack of character, but it has to be able to dance in the shadows if that�s the case.

Red Rock Triple Reve;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Tripel;Red Rock Brewing;Bottle: &nbsp Straw in color, very hazy, light to moderate frothy white head, spotty lacing. &nbsp Bready nose, soft pale fruit, very minor floral aspects. &nbsp On the tongue its not as Tripel like as one would think. &nbsp Seems like a Belgian, but not terribly floral. &nbsp Has a musty woody aspect to it, slightly vinous in the chardonay sense. &nbsp Backside has a soft fruity breadiness to it. &nbsp As it warms, I do sense a slight Brett aspect. &nbsp Some honey comes out as well not that it has warmed up. &nbsp Body and mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Finish is oakish, some white wine, minor pale fruit, and soft yeasty breadiness. &nbsp Its like your average American Tripel, but with a twist. &nbsp Enjoyable, even if a little simple despite the effort to dress it up. &nbsp More enjoyable than most American examples. &nbsp Thanks Dallas for the bottle!

Red Rock Triple Reve;Salt Lake City, Utah, United States;Tripel;Red Rock Brewing;Redrock reve. 750ml bottle thanks to Derek for bringing this by... Pours a hazy somewhat golden apricot orange hue and topped with a semi- fluffy vivid white head... Aroma of soft semi-funked horse blanket, a touch of port, and a softer sense if sweetness contributed by the base tripel... Citrus fruit and semi-sweet to start. Spritzy mouthfeel which takes away from the base beer. Finishes somewhat dry with a citrusy vanila fruit essence. Lighter bodied which also assists in its drinkability. Not bad. 7/4/7/4/14

Big Sky Crystal Ale;Missoula, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Sky Brewing Company;Bottle - This was kind of bland and blah. I have come to never expect greatness from this style. A slightly bready maltiness, with some sweet honey notes. Tastes like the 2nd runnings of one of their other beers, possibly the trout slayer, but just weak and bland all the way though, finishes with a slightly bitter citrus hop note.
Big Sky Crystal Ale;Missoula, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Sky Brewing Company;Bottle. R-Bar, Bozeman Not sure if this was a really old bottle, but I was very dissapointed. Very clear and light. Minimal nose, overcarbed.

Big Sky Crystal Ale;Missoula, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Sky Brewing Company;As expected, clear with white head. Refreshing and light. More flavor than I thought I�d get. I could put many of these away on a hot tejas summer day.
Big Sky Crystal Ale;Missoula, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Sky Brewing Company;"This beer struck me as being a bit under-rated on this site. I�ve noticed Big Sky beers popping up everywhere, and their IPA is certainly no good, but I was curious about some of their other beers, and was plesantly (albeit minorly) surprised by this beer. Its smell is bad (overly corn-ish smelling), but its tasting is faintly hoppy and pleasant. Not a bad beer, and earns a weak recommendation from me. Its appearance is a hazy bright yellow, with a head that is pleasantly abundant consisting of inconsistently sized bubbles. Aroma is a bit off-putting; this beer smells like corn grits. Flavor is good; very light but hoppy. Mouthfeel is unremarkable. There is a fair amount to like about this beer...I would drink this again."
Big Sky Crystal Ale;Missoula, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Sky Brewing Company;Pours piss yellow with a very small white head. Horrible aroma is bad with that beer on the floor smell. I wish I could explain that crappy aroma. Ttaste is lemon, grass, soap. Not good.
Big Sky Crystal Ale;Missoula, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Sky Brewing Company;I�m trying to decide if I enjoyed this or if I felt it was a disappointment. This is one seriously fruity kolsch. In the aroma there is apples, some oranges with little hop profile at all. I can deal with it from a kolsch though. Appearance is crystal clear, dark yellow with medium white head. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with a slight dry finish. Flavors are apples, some grassy hops, bready yeast, and some sweet malt. The main part though is it reminds you of drinking golden grape juice, not the concord kind mind you. It is refreshing and it goes down very quickly. Average beer.
Big Sky Crystal Ale;Missoula, Montana, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Big Sky Brewing Company;12 oz bottle from Bev Mo La Mesa. Pours a deep golden color.....lite white head. Aroma of some hops, maybe some citrus fruits.

Snake River Pingora Porter;Jackson, Wyoming, United States;Porter;Snake River Brewing Co.;On cask at the brewpub. Dark, sweet and smoky... would be perfect with BBQ and surely that�s intentional. Smoke is a bit on the obvious side, but that�s all right with me. Maybe a bit rich to drink much of.

Great Northern Golden Goat;Keystone, Colorado, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Great Northern Tavern;"Light golden hue. Creamy up front; crisper toward the finish. Curious, spicy note of coriander and/or orange peel, perhaps ... it was subtle, but it kept my attention. Otherwise, the beer was rather light and unimpressive. However, it was very clean and it didn�t have any off-flavors; kudos to the brewer."
Great Northern Railroad IPA;Keystone, Colorado, United States;IPA;Great Northern Tavern;"Draft pint at the brewery/restaurant 9/13/06: Amber color with a gluey, laced white head. Not much aroma at all; bit of a sour aspect at first. Pretty even-toned malt beer, nothing exciting."
Great Northern Railroad IPA;Keystone, Colorado, United States;IPA;Great Northern Tavern;Very light golden with a creamy, lasting head. Light and grainy malts were OK, but they didn�t do much for me. I did like the hops, though. They were floral, bitter, and relatively complex. Nice aromatics. Surprisingly decent IPA.

Ottos Roggen Bier;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;HBF. I havent had many Rye ales but this one was excellent. It fits all the style guidelines of a hefe or perhaps a dunkelweizen due to its darker color. Nice sweetness balanced by classic banana aromas from the german yeast. Honestly- if they said they used 40% wheat instead of rye I wouldnt be able to to the difference. When drinking this- assume it to be a hefe. It is very good and refreshing.
Ottos Roggen Bier;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Sampled draft at the Harrisburg Brewer�s Fest. Good drinkable beer. Tasted more like a helles to me then a hefe. Didn�t have any clove or fruit flavor.
Ottos Roggen Bier;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;Great wheat beer aroma, heavy on the rye with banana, clove, bubblegum - smooth and sweet. Dark amber cloudy beer with off-white lacing head. Medium body - a bit chewy - and smooth carbonation. Taste starts a bit acidic but predominantly sweet with no bitterness. Flavors of grain/malt, rye, banana, clove, spice. Finish is acidic, sweet with no bitterness with after of cloves and just a little bitterness.
Ottos Roggen Bier;State College, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Otto's Pub and Brewery;[draft - 10th Annual PA Microbrewers Fest, Pennsylvania Brewing Co. - Pittsburgh, PA] Not quite sure if this is really a German Hefeweizen, but it really tasted like one. Please feel free to correct me. Poured a dark orange color with not much of a head. Good wheat aroma with a slightly sweet twinge. Initial taste was a strong wheat and grain one with that slight mixture of sweetness following it up, mostly a banana taste.

Heubacher Hefeweissbier;Heubach, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hirschbrauerei Heubach;It�s a beautiful unclear yellow-golden beer with a huge, creamy and long lasting head. The aroma has notes of yeast, fruits and wheat, it�s soft. The sweet flavor has notes of yeast ever so slightly sour in a good way, fruits including banana, wheat, and the finish is soft and slightly spicy.

Springhead Ruperts Ruin;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Springhead Brewery;Has a smooth quality which makes it easy to drink, some hops and some malts in the flavour.
Springhead Ruperts Ruin;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Springhead Brewery;Tasted this in the Failford Inn, Failford in January 2006. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear copper red in colour with a thin white head. Strong dark berry note in the fruity aroma. Thin but creamy texture to the mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a fiery gingerbread like base with jammy redcurrant fruit flavours present. Strong spicy hop resins compliment the malt well in the light bitter aftertaste. Finish is malty and surprisingly dry with woody briar notes full in the mouth. A decent session bitter and well recommended.
Springhead Ruperts Ruin;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Springhead Brewery;Cask (Market Porter, London) 6 Simple, slightly pungent fruity hop aroma. 4 Deep reddy brown, small head. 6 Fruity, apple retronasals at first, then caramel. Little more after that. 3 Soft palate, carbonation low. Finish gently caramelly. 12 Adequate beer, but relying too much on the sweet caramalt, which I find a little boring.
Springhead Ruperts Ruin;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Springhead Brewery;Cask (handpump) at the Market Porter, Southwark on 2 August 2010. Copper colour. No head. Not a lot of condition. Mainly fruity. Berry fruit to the fore. Finishes with some dry malt. Not really my type of bitter - I tend to prefer more hoppy, bitter bite.
Springhead Ruperts Ruin;Laneham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Springhead Brewery;From the cask at the Turf Tavern Oxford - made a wonderful lunchtime pint. Nice deep colour and strong earthy malt and bitter taste. Cold day therefore cold beer so difficult to appreciate the full aroma.

Willys Original Bitter;Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Willys Brewery;At last I�ve got round to reviewing a beer in Willy�s: two hand-pulled pints before �The Town� won 5-1 later in the day (10 Oct 2012). The beer has changed a little over the years and now sits at 3.8% ABV: still amber, clear and clean looking along with it�s biege foaming head. Always fresh, you can see the brewing kettle and the rest of the brewery from a window towards the back of the bar! The nose was a mixed bag of malts (biscuity) and hops (fruity): the taste also a pleasant blend of flavours, the semi-sweet biscuity malts just about winning the battle for dominance over the fruity, yet bittering hops. Very easy to drink and flavoursome session beer, always have two pints to make sure you�ve enjoyed it, I do.
Willys Original Bitter;Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Willys Brewery;Sampled this bitter in Willy�s Pub in Cleethorpes, June 2000. Cask, handpump dispense. Pale amber in colour with a frothy white head. This ale had a really terrible pungent aroma (best described as something unsavoury stuck to the sole of your shoe!)Thankfully the beer tasted much better - if you could get passed that aroma. Pale malts giving a slight biscuity malt texture in the mouth with a subtle hint of tart gooseberry fruit. Strong aromatic hop resin in the dry aftertaste. Finish is slightly malty with tart gooseberry fruit still in the mouth. An ok session bitter but hey, correct that aroma!
Willys Original Bitter;Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Willys Brewery;Cask @ 2nd Saltburn Beer Festival. A hazy yellow/orange colored beer, with a light beige head.

G�ller Weizenbock;Zeil am Main, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei G�ller;Wow, was f�r ein Outfit. Das Etikett sagt schon (der abgeb. Bock), mit meinen 7% ist nicht zu spa�en und die Optik zeigt stark hefetr�bes, bernsteinfarbenes Wei�bier mit leicht alkoholischem Geruch. Der Antrunk ist s�sslich karamellmalzig, w�rzig und leicht fruchtig. Der Geschmack bleibt dann eher w�rzig und malzbetont. Geringf�gig s�uerliche Abgangsnoten. Der Nachgeschmack ist durchaus gut, hier ist der st�rkere Alkoholgehalt bemerkbar, ohne das es alkoholisch schmeckt, Hefearomen gepaart mit w�rzig-malzigen Elementen bleiben eine Weile erhalten. Mal ein Bier aus dem Hause G�ller, wo man kein Rauchmalz rausschmeckt.

G�ller Weizenbock;Zeil am Main, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei G�ller;Veeery nice. Color is thick and just a bit darker than a Weihenstephaner Vitus. More on the orange side.

No dryness at the end. Magnificent.
G�ller Weizenbock;Zeil am Main, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei G�ller;Very stereotypical malt/beer aroma and taste. Cloves and spices are what stand out, however the palate is fairly simple. Not a bad beer.

Slightly sweetish, rather yeasty-spicy and slightly fruity taste of lots of clove, banana, honey, vanilla and pear, followed by a medium long, slightly bitter, a little sourish and very yeasty-spicy finish. Medium to full body, slightly creamy and moderately effervescent mouthfeel, average carbonation. Tasty, satisfying, classic and clove-forward Weizenbock. Not the best I�ve ever had, but the low score is a bit surprising.
G�ller Weizenbock;Zeil am Main, Bavaria, Germany;Bock - Weizenbock;Brauerei G�ller;Dark orange colour, very hazy. Average head, not too big for the style, decent retention and lacing. Aroma has strong banana, bubblegum sweetness and slight clove. Taste follows the aroma with a very sweet (even for the style) bubblegum base, banana and a bit of clove. Only the slightest hint of acidity to compensate for sweetness. Medium body, soft and slightly lower than style average carbonation. Actually a bit thin of a mouthfeel for a weizenbock and also slightly chewy. Overall it�s drinkable but definitely not that worth

Bartrams Taurus;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;"Dark brown beer with orange highlights; small yellow-cream head. Winelike aroma�s, dark malts, black chocolate, some nutmeg. Quite bitter beer, very woody in character. Dry & tanninerich, nearly woodstripper-like. Very faint fruity flavours. In the finish, again, chocolate flavours, and some liquorice. Very dry, going to thin, but it is not watery. I even find some adstringency. A bitter, this? Not bad, but a bit severe. It�s not a real session beer, its low ABV notwithstanding."
Bartrams Taurus;Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bartrams;Bright bottled @ Thurrock Fest. No fresh notes as the bell had been rung and I was rushing to get the last of my bottles filled.

Pretty pale golden yellow, still and clear with a scummy off white head. Aroma is lemon and grapefruit, touch pissy. Body is quite light, smooth, soft carbonation - touch higher than normal for cask. Taste is very easy going with watery notes of straw, honey, dissolved sugars, touches of grapefruit and soap astringency in finish. Not far off being a good one but their Dionysus is a lot better.

Milton Colossus;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;Cask conditioned at The Turf Tavern, Oxford. Amber with white head. Initially quite heavy on the toffee / caramel front, which then gives way to a little alcohol burn. Some sharpish hop notes with grapefruit pith showing through. Expected a little more from these.
Milton Colossus;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;Cask at the Pembury Tavern, March 2007. Didn�t seem very pale to me. Sort of orangey ginger colour. Slight oily hop aroma. Also some fruity, estery notes reminiscent of bubblegum or even wine gums. Quite flowery hops in the flavour with orange flesh / peel and some sweetish crystallised fruit. I can see what Mes is getting at with marmalade. Fairly light mouthfeel for 5.6% with only a modest bitterness. Certainly a tasty beer but maybe a touch short of grip. Pretty good anyway.

Surprised the rates for this so for are a little lacklustre. Thought it was really well balanced and tasty. Great notes of marmalade and marzipan (Battenburg) in the flavour.

Milton Mausoleum;Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Milton Brewery;"Orange/copper colour. Some butterscotch and caramel in the aroma, with a touch of ""homebrew"" yeast. The flavour has sharp, citric hops and the finish is rather acidic.

Skol International;Wieselburg, Austria;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Wieselburger Brauerei (Brau Union);Cheap with a heavy taste of hop. The bottle is everything but appealing andere almost no sparkling sensation. Austrian beer isnt always top notch, but this is below level.

Red Rose Care Taker of History;Great Harwood, Lancashire, England;Strong Ale - English;Red Rose Brewery;[i] Cask at National Winter Ales Festival, Manchester 2008 [/i] Dark brown in colour with roasted malts and some coffee notes. This was a pretty decent drop, quite porter like, and quite a filling beer. The alcohol was well hidden but started to be noticeable at the end. Not bad.

Red Rose Care Taker of History;Great Harwood, Lancashire, England;Strong Ale - English;Red Rose Brewery;According to the pump clip, this beer was named in memory of Jim Rudge 1938-2003, but I haven�t been able to find out who he was. Alcoholic vinous aroma. Deep amber colour, but not dark enough to be a porter or an old ale, although it certainly had a porter-like sour edge. There are plenty of hops to cut through the sweetness. At this stage in the proceedings, after 5 hours at the Cambridge beer festival, I could really have done with something a bit weaker, but this went down quite well. Cask (handpump), Live & Let Live, Cambridge.

Nethergate Wise Monkeys;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;Cask conditioned handpump King Billy Northampton. A light amber coloured beer with an off-white head and lacing. The aroma has boiled sweets and there is sweet toffee and fruits throughout. Too sweet and a bit sickly. A reasonable chewiness redeems it slightly, but it is disappointing.
Nethergate Wise Monkeys;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Nethergate Brewery;A decent, if unspectacular, best bitter. Copper colour, restrained hop aroma, a touch of malt and a good dose of bitterness on the palate and a clean dry finish. It�s not going to set the world alight, but it does the job well enough. A straight down the middle marking for this one. Cask (handpump), Live & Let Live, Cambridge.
Cassels Cider - Medium Dry (Draught);Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Apple Cider;Cassels Cider;On tap at East Bedfordshire CAMRA Real Cider Bar at Bromham Mill, Bedfordshire. Very hazy gold. Faint fruity aroma. This is a bit of a primitive beast: sharp peely taste. Whooo!
Cassels Cider - Medium Dry (Draught);Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Apple Cider;Cassels Cider;Fresh, leafy, herbal, apple aroma has some notes of sulfur. Hazy deep golden body is still. Maple, apples and brown sugar flavours go together nicely. Very still and watery. Coats the teeth. Barrel sampled at GBBF 2005.
Cassels Cider - Medium Dry (Draught);Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England;Apple Cider;Cassels Cider;As Cassels is the only active cider maker in Cambridgeshire, you will come across this in quite a few pubs in Cambridge. After a bad experience with their single variety Dabinett at the beer festival early in the day, I was hoping for better with this. I was not disappointed. A dryish, clean and crisp, refreshing cider with plenty of apple fruit, a good acidic zip and just a hint of hard tannin to lend a degree of gravitas. Slips down very easily, so beware the 7% alcohol. Cask (handpump), Live and Let Live, Cambridge.
Kuhnhenn Coffee Rauch;Warren, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kuhnhenn Brewing;Pours a deep dark cloudy brown with a good two inches of thick fluffy head. Thick rings of lace throughout. Prevalent coffee and chocolate aroma. Rauch? No idea why they call it Rauch. I tasted absolutely no smoke. Asked the barkeep if it was supposed to be a smoke beer - she had no idea what I meant by smoke beer. Ah well. It was very heavy on the sweet chocolate and caramel malt. A little too heavy for my taste - I did not find it to be balanced enough by roastiness, coffee, or hops. Coffee was there, but in this beer it came across as sweet like coffee liquer. Full body, lightly carbonated, too rich for me due to the sweetness. Good beer - don�t get me wrong - but I would have liked it better if it were less sweet or more balanced. Just my opinion. Enjoyed my one glass but did not want a second. And I remain awful curious about the missing rauch...
Kuhnhenn Coffee Rauch;Warren, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kuhnhenn Brewing;had this about a month and half ago on tap sampler. pour dark ruby. aroma some chocolate and caramel weak hints of coffee. flavor berry fruits and I think banana and a mild taste of coffee.not to bad of a beer
Kuhnhenn Coffee Rauch;Warren, Michigan, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Kuhnhenn Brewing;2004 draught. Pours a light brown, with some hints of amber/orange underneath. Good mocha colored head. Smells of caramel, light roasted coffee with some chocolate in there. Little smoke apparency in the aroma. No hops as well. The flavor is quite subtle for a coffee/smoked beer. Lots of light coffee mainly, and a sweet caramel malt asserts itself. Tastes very authentic and fresh. As the caramel wears off, there is some smoked flavor on the end, it is light and cedary, not big, oily and greasy. Hops not apparent. Body is medium, lightly watery, mild carbonation.
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Tap at MacGregors, way back in November of 2004 (yeah, I have a bit of a backlog in posting my ratings). As black as can be with a smallish brown head that stays forever. Aroma of chocolate, dark fruits, and the Southern Tier trademark hopiness. Taste is roasted barley, cocoa, prunes and of course, a hops kick, as expected from ST and from an Imperial Stout. Big, thick, chewy mouthfeel, that will leave you licking your lips. Outstanding beer. Southern Tier, if you are listening, please bottle this stuff!
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Had this on tap at blind tiger, pours with a rich brown head that hangs on for a bit. Great aroma of toffee, licorrice, brown sugar, grains. Lots of body, great big mouthfeel. Flavor is sweet and full, but not ofensively so. I found it really delicious, kind of like a big beer milkshake. Yum.
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Tap @ Barcade. Pretty damn dark with aromas of chocolate malts and dried fruits. Taste is bittered nicely with even more roasted flavors. This stuff is not 13% but 10.5%. Masked nicely though. This brewery is constantly impressing me more each beer.
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Draft at MacGregors in Henrietta - Pitch black color with a thick milkshake head that was DENSE. Strong chocolate aroma with a good bit of coffee. Mouthfeel was very creamy and silky smooth. Quite nice flavor. More mild than most Imperials. More chocolate and less bitterness. There is no way this is 13%. It was as tasty as a milkshake without a HINT of alcohol. What an outstanding job from the folks at southern tier. These guys continue to impress me.
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Didn�t think I would get to try this. Black incarnate. Dark tan head. Nose is chocolate, milk, alcohol and dark fruits. Flavor reminds me of the cask Storm King I had @ the Victory brewpub but isn�t quite that good. Smoky, slightly salty, well hopped, alcoholo, milky with a bit of chocolate. Hop finish. Carbonation is great for a keg but I wish this was in a cask - the additional smoothness would be wonderful. Mmmm.
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);[draft - MacGregor�s - Henrietta, NY] Dark black color with a thick brown head. Strong chocolate aroma with roasted malts underneath. Very smooth taste of chocolate and roasty malts with a nice blend of hops and a good coffee finish. So smooth and creamy. I was shocked to see that it was 10.5%.
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);I do not know why they do not make this one more as it was an excellent example of a wonderful style. +++Draft - the beer poured completely black. Raising the glass to the light did not enable any light to shine through. There was a moderately sized dark brown creamy head that really lingered for a long time. The aroma was sharp and sour with strong hops and a hint of chocolate. This translated well into the flavor which was strongly hoppy and had a decent chocolate and coffee presence. The large malt elements balances the beer well on the front but the finish is completely dominated by the hops. The texture is thick and amazingly creamy. Like drinking liquid silk. I really wish they would make this one again. Marvelous!
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Sweet fruity aroma of rasins, plum, dates and a hint of roasted barley. Opaque nearly balck body with a small tan head. Rich chocolatey flavor, some burnt and roasty notes. Bitter roast coffee and hops in the finish with a slight rasin note. Slight warmth. Had this at McGregors in Rochester.
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);(Draught) Sampled at the Empire State Brewfest. Quick -dissipating brown head and an opaque body. Nose of cocoa and malt. Very hoppy flavour but somewhat thin. I couldn�t detect the high ABV. Its definitely a good beer and worth trying but I think its somewhat over-hyped? This brewery has done some fantastic recipes though... keep it up.
Southern Tier IS;Lakewood, New York, United States;Stout - Imperial;Southern Tier Brewing Company (ABV);Sampled at Empire Brewfest. Roasty chocolate aroma, with hints of booziness in there too. Nearly opaque blackish color with some redness around the edges. Brown head. Deep bitter bitter chocolate, hoppy flavor. Very dry. Ethanol comes through towards the end. Not shabby, but doesnt blow me out of the water. I think the ABV could be turned down.
Capitol City Rye Hop Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Capitol City Brewing Company;On tap at brewpub. Pours an orange amber-brown with a short-lasting white head. Tastes like cereals. Dry, hoppy, herbal finish. Somewhat earthy at the end. Bitterness is very resilient in this one. Medium to full-bodied. One of the best ales I�ve had at Capitol City Brewing.
Capitol City Rye Hop Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Capitol City Brewing Company;Draft... GABF �06... Mostly clear yellow ale with a small, creamy, white head. Grapefruit, pine and leather aroma. Flavor leans just slightly on the bitter side of balance. Medium-bodied with a dry mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Lengthy, astringent, Sahara-dry finish. Nice EPA!
Capitol City Rye Hop Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Capitol City Brewing Company;(Downtown) Clear amber body with off-white head, nice lacing. Aroma is medium sweet, floral/grapefruit, some rye. Taste is medium sweet, grapefruit/floral, some caramel, rye. Fairly hoppy. Light-medium body, some resin, light acidity.
Capitol City Rye Hop Ale;Arlington, Virginia, United States;Pale Ale - English;Capitol City Brewing Company;Dark amber color with a thin but persistent head. Smells strongly of, well, rye. This is one of those English ales that tastes way too bitter to drink on the first swallow, but after a few minutes the underlying flavors come out and vindicate it. Complex, dry, and grainy, this is definately not a beer to judge on first sip.
Rogue Bittermans Strong Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rogue Ales;lacey white head, brown/gold foggy body, barley wine nose, strong robust flavor rich with stringent hops
Rogue Bittermans Strong Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rogue Ales;storng hop aroma, very cloudy and brownish orange, peaty hops, a solid body, serious hop presence, long lasting bitterness, a tad out of balance
Rogue Bittermans Strong Ale;Newport, Oregon, United States;Strong Ale - American;Rogue Ales;On tap at the 2nd annual Sasquatch brew festival in Eugene,OR. Pours a reddish brown color, slightly cloudy with an off-white head. Fresh-hop citrusy aroma. Started sweet and ended with a great bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, another great brew by rogue.
Mt. Shasta King Glen Imperial Bitter;Weed, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;This beer was the bomb! I could drink this forever!!!! put a picture of this in the dictionary beside the definition of beer.
Mt. Shasta King Glen Imperial Bitter;Weed, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;Tap @ Rose & Raindrop for RBSG 04Clear ruby color with a very light head & lacing. The aroma has lots of hops and lots of sweet caramelized malts.

Mt. Shasta King Glen Imperial Bitter;Weed, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;RBSG 2004, on tap: Clear orange with some reddish tinge under a small white head. Spicy grapefruit in the nose, fizzy carbonation, starts and ends moderately bitter.
Mt. Shasta King Glen Imperial Bitter;Weed, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;On tap @ Rose & Raindrop. Dark burgundy, very thick and frothy... certainly a barley wine in my opinion. Overly-bitter, very vinuous and with some woody musty flavors... quite strong, with some tobacco in the finish.
Mt. Shasta King Glen Imperial Bitter;Weed, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;balanced honey hop aroma, yellowish orange with no head, sweet building hoppiness, grassy finish, cleans up nicely despite all the hops
Mt. Shasta King Glen Imperial Bitter;Weed, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mt. Shasta Brewing Company;On tap at the Sasquatch brew festival in Eugene,OR. Dark red/amber color with a small white head that fell quickly. Very malty aroma with a roasted edge. This was a very sweet tasting brew, clinging to the palate, very strong tasting for a bitter, probably why its imperial. Brew had a slightly bitter end and had a nice hop-finished aftertaste.
Standing Stone Dunkelweizen;Ashland, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Standing Stone Brewing Company;Sampled draught at Standing Stone Brewery, AshlandDark amber/ruby color with thin head, nice lacing. Nose of sweet fruity figs & papaya with a full bodied nutty note, very sweet, some alcohol bite. Sweet & tangy, good though.

Standing Stone Dunkelweizen;Ashland, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Standing Stone Brewing Company;Malty aroma with hints of banana and chocolate. Muddy dark brown color with a creamy head. Wheat and malt flavors a hint of banana and some cocoa. A very slight sour wheat twinge in the finish. Not a bad interpretation of the style.
Standing Stone Dunkelweizen;Ashland, Oregon, United States;Weissbier - Dunkelweizen;Standing Stone Brewing Company;On tap at the Sasquatch brew festival in Eugene, OR. I�m a big fan of a lot of the German brews, but this brew felt like they were throwing darts blindfolded. Pours a cloudy brown color with a small short-lasting white head. Aroma was slightly wheaty and malty, but no hints of spice. Taste was where this beer really fell apart, very thin and watery tasting, no spice, ended slightly bitter, but overall just kinda boring.
Golden Valley French Prairie Blanche;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Golden Valley Brewery;Bottle: &nbsp Coppery golden, large fizzy white head, very little lacing. &nbsp This seems a little off color and too dark to be a Witbier. &nbsp Dull floral nose, very faint spices, otherwise grass, straw, and hay. &nbsp Slightly barnish. &nbsp Mealy on the tongue, I suppose wheaty, but the spices just aren�t there. &nbsp If they are, its very faint. &nbsp More in common with an American Wheat than a Belgian one. &nbsp Because of the wheatiness it has a decent body and mouthfeel. &nbsp Dull on the exit, finish is boring. &nbsp Just plain ol wheaty... Color and spices are all off target. &nbsp Call it something else, cuz this is no Belgian Witbier.
Golden Valley French Prairie Blanche;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Golden Valley Brewery;Nice spice smell on this one. Possibly a little too dark for a wit. The taste is spot on. Light with many different notes.
Golden Valley French Prairie Blanche;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Golden Valley Brewery;Muted European characteristics, bastard of light beers. Decent enough, light and crisp.
Golden Valley French Prairie Blanche;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Golden Valley Brewery;On tap at GVB--Ultra pale straw body with a tiny wispy white top. Nutty, clove-banana nose. Candy and bubblegum flavor that finished smooth, creamy, and sharp. Yum!

Golden Valley French Prairie Blanche;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Golden Valley Brewery;A light and refreshing wit from GV. Cloudy golden and hazy, with a small white head, served way too cold and in a pint glass of all things.

Golden Valley French Prairie Blanche;McMinnville, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Golden Valley Brewery;On tap at the Sasquatch brew fest in Eugene, OR. Pours a pale yellow color, with a cloudy look that realy made this beer stand apart. Aroma was wheaty with a finish almost like grass or straw. Very clean and refreshing taste, fairly thin, but great for a hot day brew.
Abbey Mild;Bath, Somerset, England;Mild Ale;Abbey Ales;Cask at Coeur de Lion in Bath. Served at about 80 degrees. Truly a terrible mild. Minimal sweet malt aroma. Flavor is overwhelmingly fruity to a fault, underattenuated (despite the high 4pc ABV). Tough to even to drink.
Abbey Mild;Bath, Somerset, England;Mild Ale;Abbey Ales;A mid-brown, chocolatey brew with a thin-ish malty body but a full chocolatey, dryish finish. (Cask @ Bag o�Nails, Bristol)
Abbey Mild;Bath, Somerset, England;Mild Ale;Abbey Ales;Mid brown colour - not very dark for a mild. Smoky malt aroma. There is some coffee in the flavour, but it is all a bit thin and watery. The finish tends towards grainy. A new beer for this brewery - a reasonable first effort, but could do better. Cask (gravity), Thurrock Beer Festival.
Abbey Mild;Bath, Somerset, England;Mild Ale;Abbey Ales;"Bright bottled @ Thurrock Fest. Fresh notes: ""Gentle, light, but with a good coffee kick. Score 3.0"" A fairly average mild - I may have been a bit enthusiastic giving it a score of 3.0 - but decent enough and fairly harmless."
Coral Pilsner;Willemstad, Cura�ao;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);yteah, from the carribean.. It should be paradise overthere.. Well not for me. They can�t brew beer. This is not really good. Watery, slightly hoppy beer. No head at all with a clear yellow colour.
Coral Pilsner;Willemstad, Cura�ao;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Antilliaanse Brouwerij (Heineken);"Canned, 25 cl (8.5 fl. oz). A friend of mine took this from his trip to Aruba, Neth Antilles. Trying to give you as much information as possible, the can has slogans like: ""beer of the west indies"", ""brewed and canned by antilliaanse brouwerij N.V."" and ""brewed with desalinated caribbean seawater and all natural ingredients"". The beer pours a clear yellow color, with a soda-like white head, which dies immediately. Aroma consists of some faint hops, grain, with a metallic hint, probably from the can, which survived the flight-trip from Aruba to the Netherlands. Taste is quite bitter, moderately sweet and slightly sour even. Watery and dry palate."
Salamander Overlord;Bradford, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Salamander;Cask Conditioned, White Horse, Hedgerley, Bucks. Gravity Dispense, poured by me. Another great golden ale from Salamander, this one is slightly darker than others, and with a lot more punch (although it's not at all noticeable).

Heubacher Uralb Spezial;Heubach, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hirschbrauerei Heubach;Bottle, 500 ml at Manufaktur, Schorndorf. Golden with small white head. Bready malty, herbs, grass. Hint of fruit.
Heubacher Uralb Spezial;Heubach, Baden-W�rttemberg, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Hirschbrauerei Heubach;The color is light golden with a light grey hue, makes me think of filtered apple juice, and the head isn�t anything like the heads normally are from this brewery. I suspect is is a tad oxidiated - and the mouth feel supports this, as it�s flat. Both aroma and the slightly sweet flavor has very subdued notes of malt and light flower or fruit, the finish is slightly dry. Unfortunately i only can rate what I taste, not what I think this one might be if sealed properly.
Glentworth Lemon Showers;Skellow, South Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Glentworth Brewery;Cask Conditoned, White Horse, Hedgerley, Bucks. Gravity Dispense, poured by me. A tasty golden ale, with a fair dose of lemon. Very drinkable. ABV is around 4.4-4.5%, but I�m not sure of it exactly.

Schoune Imperial Stout;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Originally rated November 2006. Finally, a Schoune brew that is above average and that does not seem infected (helping is the 8.5% ABV). Pours a black colour with a slim highlight of red. The head is brown and creamy, with good retention and nice mountainy lace. The main aroma I get is quite nutty, with some roasted malt, molasse, coffee and a bit of chocolat. Thick enough mouthfeel and full-bodied. Great taste of dark malts, roasted, chocolat and burnt. Also found is coffee, molasse and tobacco flavours. A very smooth Imperial Stout. I would have this brew anytime.
Schoune Imperial Stout;Saint-Polycarpe, Quebec, Canada;Stout - Imperial;Ferme Brasserie Schoune;Pours a coal gray brown with a thin beige head- thins out. Aroma is fruity esters, with light dusty earthy chocolate, burnt toast, and light caramel. Flavor is sweet, brown sugar, candy sugar, chocolate, roast, oily, light dusty chocolate but it is subtle, some hints of smokey tar, and a thin slick finish. Meh
De Brouwers Grand Place Kriek;Bruxelles, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;"The (top-fermented) kriek from this brewery, tasted in 2007; typical red colour, loose head, sweet cherry and candy aroma with some nutty malts shining through, sweet taste but not too cloying, very thin mouthfeel, no finish to speak of.

De Brouwers Grand Place Kriek;Bruxelles, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Les Brasseurs de la Grand Place;Draft at the brewpub in Brussels. Pours a deep cherry red with a small head. Aroma is sweet and strong cherry, taste is much of the same. Very little alcohol and minimal sourness. I really enjoyed this Kriek in the taster set, however I prefer kriek in small volumes as I find it sickly after a while.

Cherry and chocolate in the nose, as a cherry-filled praline. But a cheap one. Pale cherry taste, again chocolate in this one. Not TOO artificial. Terribly thin palate, watery and a bit slick. Tourist-type cherry. OTOH, I have tasted worse than this. Maybe not even the worst choice when visiting this place."
Haacht Adler Premium Luxus;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Haacht;Bottle at Leeuw aan de brug, Valkenburg a/d Geul poured in to an slightly curved glass.

Haacht Adler Premium Luxus;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Haacht;6.5% pilsner. Stable head, simple. Quite malty, decent enough body, very little hop. Quaffable but as expected bit crazy interesting. Still, I didn�t mind a single sip. (On tap at the brewpub)

Haacht Adler Premium Luxus;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Haacht;The follow-up to Haacht�s original Adler Dortmunder, with cobweb-lacing, snow white, medium sized stable head over deep �old gold� coloured beer, cristal clear with low amounts of sparkling. Malt-forward and simple aroma of cooked corn, cookies, some sweaty grains, hint of white bread and grass, as well as the unmistakable skunked smell of ammonia, luckily fading away within moments. Fairly neutral, malt and corn sweetish taste with no esters as expected from a lager, soft carbo, grainy and malt sweet, slightly biscuity finish with low hop bitterness. The old version deserved its place as one of the last remaining Belgian Dortmunders, a lager style which was notably more popular here many a decade ago, but in this form with lower ABV and thinner body, it has become something in between a standard pale lager and a Dortmunder, thus becoming redundant for either category. They had better kept it like it was, if you ask me.
Haacht Adler Premium Luxus;Boortmeerbeek, Belgium;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;Haacht;Alone at home. Clear goldblond colored beer with small white head and lots of carbonation. Herby hopped aroma. Full sparkling palate. Finish is bitter herby hopped sweet.

Pale yellow ""lager"" colour. The ginger is noticeable in the aroma, but there�s an unpleasant diacetyl buttery undertone too. Spicy ginger flavour.

Leatherbritches Ginger Helmet;Ashby De La Zouch, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leatherbritches Brewery;Dartford fest. Gravity. Yellowish. Ginger in the nose. A thirst quenching and very drinkable ginger ale. A perfect summer drink. Gentle ginger flavouring. Inviting mouthfeel. Sadly a bit of diacetyl is present and the beer is a bit green, but the Ginger Helmet comes through all the scum to stand proud. Tasty boy!
Leatherbritches Ginger Helmet;Ashby De La Zouch, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leatherbritches Brewery;Golden with a small white head. Aromas are sweet, sugary malts with lots of ginger (as expected). Flavours remind me of sweet ginger beer. Not much sign of alcohol and too sweet for me. Its a shame it doesn�t have that ginger beer bite to redeem it.
Leatherbritches Ginger Helmet;Ashby De La Zouch, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leatherbritches Brewery;Hand pulled at Out of the Vaults, Leicester. Rather delicious beer, strongly flavoured with ginger but remaining bitter and refreshing. The ginger taste is sweet and the mouthfeel correspondingly syruppy. Light feel, fairly floral, and whilst I could see this getting cloying after a couple of pints, it was good stuff. Nice to try something different which realy comes off.

Looks good for the style; a mostly transparent burnt golden orange with foamy eggshell head. Smells mildly sweet and hoppy with soft notes of caramel.

Poured amber in color with a large, creamy, off-white head that diminished but lasted throughout. Clear. Sparkling. Good lacing. Flavor is lightly sweet and lightly bitter. Tastes of English malts, hops, slight hops, and a hint of tea. Medium body. Smooth, dry texture. Soft to average carbonation. Caramel, malt, and slight hop finish is dry.
The Brew Kettle Extra Bitter Special Bitter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;Courtesy of Poonpillager. Pours copper with thin off white to tan head. The aroma is sweet and a bit odd too. The oddness seems to be cedar resin moving toward sap and going along with sweet malts. The taste is a bit sweet and malty to start becoming somewhat bitter with a big hoppy spiciness that moves into the cedar resin woody grassiness noticed in the nose. Interesting brew. Did crizay have his hand in the making of this?
The Brew Kettle Extra Bitter Special Bitter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;Bottle courtesy of Gillard I think. Pours a slightly hazy copper with a one finger off-white head. Aroma of pale malt, earthy hops, and tea. Taste is the same as aroma. Medium thin mouthfeel with a mild amount of bitterness. Decent.
The Brew Kettle Extra Bitter Special Bitter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;As a side note, my bottle looked different than in the picture illustrated here (had an English looking fellow running). Anyhow, purchased 2/04 at the brew kettle (22 oz. bottle). Poured an amber/copper color with a lite off white head that lingered. Very clear and drinkable looking. The aroma was lite and what I would expect if I were brewing an ESB. Some downplayed sweet malt, lite pine and/or citrus peal hops. A bit metallic and crisp. The flavor was very lite (almost watery at first) with a slight metallic twinge (but in a good way if you can imagine it). However, this gives way to a lite and well balanced pine bitterness with mild malt caramel. I very much enjoyed this brew. I would call this a good example of an ESB and what I would brew on a regular basis as a session beer.
The Brew Kettle Extra Bitter Special Bitter;Strongsville, Ohio, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;The Brew Kettle;22 oz bottle: Medium amber w/ orangy highlights. Lasting medium sized off white head. Aromas of toasted malt, very little herbal hop, and some English yeasty esters. Hints of caramel as it warms. Well balanced, but not bitter at all. Toasted malt and caramel flavors, very little herbal hop, w/ a light green apple fruitiness. Finish is on the semi sweet side, aftertaste is lightly hop and toasty malt flavored. Lighter body, but not watery, medium carbonation. Lightly dry m/f. Overall a very drinkable session beer. A good quaffer, but nothing fantastic.

Siletz RedHead Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Sampled on draught at the brewpub in Siletz, Oregon during the ABA 07 Beer Tour. Pours a hazy dark amber brew with a thin off-white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film. Aroma of thick wet doughy malt (scent usually detected outside a brewery or bakery), dark pitted fruits and a touch of roasted hazelnuts. Taste is lightly carbonated, medium bodied with flavors of caramel malt, grassy hop bitterness, and a hint of tart cherres. Finish is slightly acidic with a yeasty dough aftertaste.
Siletz RedHead Ale;Siletz, Oregon, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Siletz Brewing and Public House;Aroma of darkish stone fruit and some caramel. Reddish copper color with a white head that diminished quickly, but seems willing to lace. Medium bodied, light carbonated. Has that citrus sour characteristic of many Siletz ales, followed by medium caramel malt. I�m guessing citrus/fruit hop. It�s well balanced, and the malt and sour diminish in the finish to a very pleasant residue. Tasty.

City of Cambridge Rutherford IPA;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;City of Cambridge Brewery;Deep amber with a wholesome white head. Yeasty and lightly hopped aroma. Tingly, sweet and slightly hoppy flavours and some fruitiness. Something barnyardy, along the lines of musty straw. A very smooth finish to a beer that is almost too watery but is pretty much a tasty allrounder.
City of Cambridge Rutherford IPA;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;City of Cambridge Brewery;Bottle. Pours red amber with a fluffy head. Earthy hop nose with hints of grass. Some toffee flavours blending with solid bitterness, that actually come out a bit harsh. Light-bodied. Decent enough.
City of Cambridge Rutherford IPA;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;City of Cambridge Brewery;Cambridge Beer Festival. Dark amber, looks still with no head. Aroma is bitter hops, not much else. Slightly watery, but a slight fizz on the tongue. Very average.

City of Cambridge Rutherford IPA;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;City of Cambridge Brewery;Cask@The Market Porter, Borough, London.

City of Cambridge Darwins Downfall;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;City of Cambridge Brewery;Bottle conditioned, 500ml. Deep Mahogany red with white head. Beautiful looking beer, but thats as far as you can go, terrible acidic, sour taste in the bottle conditioning, I think that all the East Anglian micro�s must use the same bottlers as its hard to get a good one. I will re rate when I get hold of the cask beer.
City of Cambridge Darwins Downfall;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;City of Cambridge Brewery;Bottled. Hazy amber colour with a small bubbly white foam. Toasted malts and lemon in the aroma with a small acidic touch. Smooth flavour of nuts, toasted malts, lights chocolate with notes of grassy and orangey hops.

City of Cambridge Darwins Downfall;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;City of Cambridge Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), Cambridge Beer Festival, May 2006. A flavoursome darkish brown beer, with a ruby tint. The abundance of chocolate notes on the nose surprised me until I realised that this is, in fact, a brewery blend including Parkers Porter. More chocolate, together with rich malt and nutty notes on the palate,. Leavened by a decent hit of hop bitterness, leading to a quite dry finish. Clean, smooth mouthfeel. rather nice. Seems to be better on cask than from bottle, judging by the comments here.
City of Cambridge Darwins Downfall;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;City of Cambridge Brewery;Cask conditioned - gravity dispense - Cambridge BF.

City of Cambridge Holly Heaven;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Old Ale;City of Cambridge Brewery;"Orange-amber clear beer; small yellowish head, slightly irregular. Rather sourish nose, as pickled fruits, and then dry hops and some faraway malts kick in. Surprising fresh flowery hops taste - makes me think of cask Landlord. Flavour of - bananaflower?, dried corianderleaf and faint spruce. Delicate and nice, light sourish touch intertwining with the hopbitter and a suspicion of maltsweet. Light and dry. It�s very light for a Christmas ale, but admittedly, perfect for a bottled best bitter. Can�t help but liking this a lot - thanks, MatW."

City of Cambridge Holly Heaven;Dereham, Norfolk, England;Old Ale;City of Cambridge Brewery;Mid brown colour. Soft fruit, with touches of caramel and toffee. Not sure I would have picked it out as an Old Ale. Nice enough, but it didn�t really stand out from the crowd. And in this context, the crowd included some pretty big beers, so it might have fared better had I tasted it in isolation, or in parallel with more modest brews. I�ll try it again if the opportunity arises. Cask (gravity dispense), White Cliffs Beer Festival, February 2005.

West Virginia Fondelblonde;Morgantown, West Virginia, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;West Virginia Brewing Company;Don�t you just love the name of this brew? Ubiquitous pale yellow lager color and appearance. Big foamy white head. Clean and slightly metallic aroma. Rather refreshing to say the least. Has a slight background bitterness that is well controlled. Taste has some perfumy attributes associated with it. There is a bit of industrial bitterness that builds during the session.

Fairly standard bitter with a slight fruitiness and sweetness, a little Wetherspoons special tartness, I reckon they should market this, cask ale with the Wetherspoons touch,a bit like a Belgian sour.

Elgoods Mad Dog;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elgoods Brewery;Cask (Regal, Cambridge) Another reason to insult McSpoons. With challenger, as well as traditional bitter hops, this ought to be a great crisp golden ale. Instead, thanks to traditional Wetherspoons cellarmanship, it�s old and tired, and to be honest, bad. Must re-rate.

Elgoods Mad Dog;Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Elgoods Brewery;Cask at Clockwork, Glasgow. A hazy amber beer with a thin off-white head. The aroma is sweet malty, and so is the flavor, though also added a light citrusy note.
Bullfrog Black-N-Blues-Berry Wheat;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bullfrog Brewery;On tap at pub. Bright pink-amber pour, creamy thin white head. Significant earth in nose, almost manure, wheat, and a faint but skin-heavy and realistically refreshing grape and sweet blueberry. Awesome for a fruit-wheat beer, best I�ve had. Flavor is similar, crisp fruit and wheat through the flavor, perhaps a faint bit metallic but still very light, dry through the finish, and amazingly un-syrupy.
Bullfrog Black-N-Blues-Berry Wheat;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bullfrog Brewery;I tohught this beer was very good. Dark almost purple color and a sweet nose. Flavor was slightly sweet, not overpowering. It was very drinkable and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Bullfrog Black-N-Blues-Berry Wheat;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bullfrog Brewery;The problem with so many fruit beers is to me twofold. First what fruit flavors they have end up tasting too artificial. Secondly the fruit sweetness dominates so much that you can not taste the underlying beer. This beer succeeds in avoiding both of these pitfalls. Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a purplish caramel color with a small white head. There is a strong sweet berry aroma. The flavor is strong and fruity but not too sweet. The fruits taste very real. There is a nice underlying wheat beer flavor that is not overwhelmed by the sweet fruity elements. This beer works very well.
Bullfrog Black-N-Blues-Berry Wheat;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bullfrog Brewery;Im not a huge fan of these berry/fruit/wheat beers, but this one was pretty decent for what it was. I saved it for after my lunch- kinda like for desert. Pours a murky deep pink,/light purple, with an ok head that fades. Aroma is very pungent and sweet with lots of berries. Blueberry, blackberry etc. Flavor is pretty smooth overall with lots of fruit, and a good smooth malt profile. Finishes pretty easy without being too tart.
Bullfrog Black-N-Blues-Berry Wheat;Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Bullfrog Brewery;[draft - 10th Annual PA Microbrewers Fest, Pennsylvania Brewing Co. - Pittsburgh, PA] When I called the brewer, they said it was and amber wheat beer, but I don�t know exactly what this is. So like the other beers I�ve added, this one�s open to corrections if anyone knows anything about it. Poured a semi-dark amber color with a thin white head. Strong berry aroma, a good combination of blackberry and blueberry, with a nice wheaty backbone. Sweetness was one of the first things that I tasted, with a nice wheat followup and a crisp and sweetly bitter finish. I definitely would like to find out more about this one.
Deep Creek Red Head Rye;McHenry, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Deep Creek Brewing Company;[draft - 10th Annual PA Microbrewers Fest, Pennsylvania Brewing Co. - Pittsburgh, PA] Poured a dark amber hue with a thin off-white head.

Left Coast Hop Juice;San Clemente, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Left Coast Brewing Company;A super tasty Triple IPA by Left Coast The addition of mosaic hops is just the cherry on top.

Left Coast Hop Juice;San Clemente, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Left Coast Brewing Company;473ml can from Garden, Jiyugaoka. Quite surprised to find something like this over there! Creamy orange with some white foam on top. Nose is fruity sweetish, light resiny grassy hops there too. Feels fresh and green. Taste is quite intense, hop marmalade, not that cloying but it does have sturdy body which is balanced by a bucketload of hops. Alcohol is well hidden, 10% is nowhere to be seen. Solid stuff, one of the best and most balanced Triple IPA's I have had.

Tigertops Just Jane;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tigertops Brewery;Gold colour. Curious caramel malt aroma - reminded me of those Caramac chocolate bars.

Wentworth Gun Park Dark;Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England;Mild Ale;Wentworth;Deep red/brown colour. Some coffee in the aroma, with woody undercurrents. Dry palate with roast malt - slightly sharp for a mild. A dry and woody, rather than fruity and juicy. A fair amount of backbone for a low ABV mild. Not bad. Cask, GBBF 2004.

Le Cheval Blanc Abysse Cornue;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;A hazy amber beer with a huge light orange head. The aroma is of yeast, oranges, caramel, nutmeg, and some spices I can�t put a name on, but the draw down in my impression.

Le Cheval Blanc Abysse Cornue;Montr�al, Quebec, Canada;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Le Cheval Blanc - Brasseur Artisan & Bar;Sampled at the brewpub, served in a bottle with homemade printer-style label. Opaque and copper, with a light bubbly head that died down to a quiet ring around the pint glass. Anise, some pepper, a faint horseblanket and fusel alcohol finish in the nose. Interesting! Carbonation feels light, and felt sour like cherries. A good mix of yeast/bread, with black licorice and maybe a little szechuan pepper. Aftertaste is prickly and the tongue a little spicy. Not bad altogether.

High Desert Rye Beer;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;High Desert Brewing Company;This was probably my favorite High Desert beer. The rye looked and tasted like the IPA, but it had a greater complexity of palate and taste. Although there wasn�t as much spice or sweetness as there could have been, the beer had a nice, creamy feel on the tongue. I heard the brewmaster say the he wants to get rid of it because it doesn�t sell, so you should take advantage of it while you can. (Oh, and, they do consider it an ale.)
High Desert Rye Beer;Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;High Desert Brewing Company;tap at brewery-pours a golden yellow appearance with medium cabonation. nice white head that lasted for a while. aroma is of spicy hops and sweetness.

Overall, a nice beer!

Titanic Golden Age;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Titanic Brewery (UK);Cask at Wellington Arms, Bedford. Gold with a small white head. Sweet gluey malt aroma with a trace of citrus. Heavy, grainy malt taste and a sharp bitter finish. I found this oddly overpowering and pushy.

Titanic Golden Age;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Titanic Brewery (UK);Light orange, large spongy head. Honey and pungent hop aroma. Fairly full body for a golden. Some back of the mouth resiny dark bitterness. The finish is basically that bitterness - it�s grapefruit but with no sweetness at all. Palate was soft, carbonation low but not flat. Not aromatic enough to really hit the �gold� spot for me, but way better than the bland sweet nonsense that goes under that moniker.
Titanic Golden Age;Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Titanic Brewery (UK);Golden Age is back. Cask-conditioned at the Seven Stars, Bristol 16/05/09.

Great Dane Barristers Brown Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Brown Ale;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub (downtown). Poured a clear light brown color. Head was off white and thin. Not much to the nose other than some light chocolate and a whiff of salted peanuts. Slightly sweet on the tongue with a very light body. On the watery side, actually. Moderately carbonated. The flavor was similar to the aroma. Bland, is the best one-word description. I tasted watered down cola and hints of chocolate and nuts. I didn�t get any significant hop flavor. Non-offensive, yes. As the commercial description says, it�s a session beer, but I wouldn�t want to have more than a half pint of this.

Clear medium-brown pour with copper hues... good-looking persistent beige head with some teary lacing as it went down. Frest coffee, nuttiness, caramel, and citrusy hoppage hit the nose. Cola/tea-like feel on the palate, with Cascade bitterness on the finish. Flavor was surprisingly hoppy up front (Cascade and some bittering hops), backed by sweet caramel malts and nuttiness. Very well balanced... and I�m fairly certain that the older ratings are for a different recipe or bad batch(es)."

The aroma has cascade hops, light nuttiness, iced tea. The flavor is nutty bars and cascade hops. The hops are light but apparent. For a ""brown"", I�m liking this.

Les Vergers de la Colline Promesse d'Automne;Sainte-C�cile-de-Milton, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Cidrerie Milton;Very pale white wine colored. Reisling acidic nose with a bit of red cherries or kirsh. The white wine flavor is omnipresent, you can barely taste the apples. What really bugged me was the aftertaste, which reminded me of cooked eggs or mayonnaise. Too light for my taste, but for an inexpensive cider, good for cooking.

Dry vinous nose reminds of apple skin most of all, but asks for heavy sniffing to get anything out. Pretty flavourful apples hit the palate up thanks to an excellent acid backbone like apples that are too young. Very good balance, dry palate, slightly nutty. Good stuff.

Nose is decadent, with lots of treacle, caramel, brown sugar and caramelized apples. Flavour is full of cloyingly sweet brown sugar, potent apple core, potent apple skin, and caramel. So intensely and cloyingly sweet, even for an ice cider. It's a pleasant one, but difficult to drink much of it - a cavity-inducer. Regardless, lovely stuff.

Pours a deep orange body with no lace/bubbles. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with notes of cinnamon sugar on apple skins, apple sauce, caramel sugar and a rich complexity balanced by the perfect amount of acidity. Wonderful to try an ice cider with so much age, especially when it seems the years have only added to the richness and complexity of the original product.

Pinnacle Cidre Ap�ritif;Frelighsburg, Quebec, Canada;Apple Cider;Domaine Pinnacle (Pomdial Inc.);Bottle sampled at Mondial 2015 with Linh, Ken and Nica. Maybe this should be unretired...unless it was a super old bottle? Pours a golden orange body. Mouthfeel is somewhere between the ciders and ice ciders - but closer in viscosity to the ice ciders. The flavor profile is also similar - richer flavors, super lush vanilla, deep fruity notes, oak, apple pie and lots of sugar. Very enjoyable.

Wagner-Br�u Oberhaid Vollbier Hell;Oberhaid, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Brauerei Wagner Oberhaid;When I parked next to the brewery tap to buy some beer the brewery seemed to be in a pretty bad shape. An old and badly maintained building, old kettles and the brewery tap seemed a bit dirty and not changed a bit in 40 years or so. Like always, there were a few older men drinking beer. I bought bottles to take home and when I got back into the car, two fat teenage schoolgirls sitting at the bus stop next to the brewery giggled at me. Now tasting this Vollbier I think the giggling made sense. A bad, malty, soapy odor, in which the farms in the direct neighborhood are smellable. A rather dirty flavor with malt, oil, boiled milk and sulphur. Hoppy oily finish. This brewery is dirty and you can taste it!

Wagner-Br�u Oberhaid Pilsener;Oberhaid, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Wagner Oberhaid;Draft at the brewpub. Polished yellow. Quick foamy white head. Shy but pleasant aroma of grass, hay, cracker dough, alcohol, and honey. Soft and creamy carbonation. Watery body. Relatively sweet up front, with honey-dabbed toasted hay characteristics obscuring the vaguely defined hop flavors whose salty and spicy bitterness is mirrored by pepper and grass. Scantly hopped, though a welcome array of delicate acids do manage to occasionally sparkle. A firm note of toasted cracker quickly fades and relinquishes its crispness to the flabbier malt dimensions. Prominent alcohol amplifies the honeyish sweetness and limp grain. Toasty and fruity finish is comprised of melon rind and pepper-dusted hay and grass. A clean and serviceable, if a bit timid, Franconian pils that would benefit from some additional crispness and hop expressiveness, specifically. Okay.

Light carbonation & head. The aroma is full of domestic 2-row with a strawberry note that barely is noticable. Smells like the fake fruity smoke they use in fire drills.

BJ's Irvington IPA;Huntington Beach, California, United States;IPA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;This is easily, by far my favorite of the BJ beers. Pours a hazy gold in color with a nice half inch head. Nice fruity, hop smell. Taste is much the same with a good amount of bitterness. This I could drink all the time.

BJ's Irvington IPA;Huntington Beach, California, United States;IPA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;On tap at B.J.�s Portland, sampled 6 August 2004. Standard fare across the board- clear copper red body, thin creamy off-white head, grapefruity, bitter, piney aroma, and the subsequent intense grapefruit citrus flavor enhanced by pine and a touch of sweet malt. Not much balance, so this beer tastes like any other beer that uses the same quantity and variety of hops.
BJ's Irvington IPA;Huntington Beach, California, United States;IPA;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Red color with a whie head that leaves minor lacing. Good ipa aroma with a good dose of hops. Taste was very bitter and had a bunch of grapefruit taste that was unappealing. Very dry finish on this ipa.

Old Hat Gold Light Lager;Lawton, Michigan, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Old Hat Brewery;Bottle-conditioned.

McMenamins Resonant Ultimator;Portland, Oregon, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the high street mcmenamins in eugnene, OR.

Pizza Port Czech Pilsner;Carlsbad, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Sampled at San Clemente, but didn�t feel it was worth submitting seperately. Clear pale appearance. Mild creamy, malty aroma. Sweetish, smooth malt flavor with hints of peppery spice. They�d be better served putting Bud on tap if they wanted to cater to the lighties.
Pizza Port Czech Pilsner;Carlsbad, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);Draught @ Pizza Port Carlsbad The beer pours the traditional Pilsner crystal clear gold with a large white head that is semi-creamy in texture, the lace a white sheet to cover the glass. Nose is the prototypical sweet malt that is fresh and clean, start is sweet and malt laden, the top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a nice crisp acidity and the hops apropos to the style, a nice drinking beer that prepared my palate for another day of �Bad Boy Hop Monsters�!
Pizza Port Czech Pilsner;Carlsbad, California, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Pizza Port (Carlsbad);"(Draft: Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA) Unfortunately, the key word here is ""disappointing"", and as the first beer I tried at Pizza Port for the afternoon, I really didn't care for this at all; This pilsner has that American pale lager flavor rather than the nice malty, smoky flavor I expect from a good Czech pilsner; But it's definitely a stronger malt and hops presence than with the crap beers out there, though the malt has a slight corn flavor to it; Balanced early, with a mild bitterness in the finish; Palate is pretty light (but heavier than the crap beers) and not especially crisp in the finish; Nose is lightly malty with a mild hoppiness, but nothing special here either; Pale yellow color with an ever-so-slight cloudiness; White head would probably have average retention at best, but the head was maintained by 2 large ""rub"" marks (from stacking) along the inside of the glass, and that initiates significant carbonation bubbles; Solid lacing in large patches; Removing ""Czech"" from the beer name might be a good idea; On second thought, modifing the recipe would be a better idea; I hate to go single digits on the overall rating for a Pizza Port beer, but nothing in my notes could justify going higher"
Buckhead Maibock;Lithonia, Georgia, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Buckhead Brewery (Corp HQ);This is the oddest bock I�ve ever tasted. I sent it back to the bartender to make sure I got the right beer. Very light pale color with smallish head. Highly hopped aroma, and light bitter taste. Medium body with a decent mouthfeel. Tasted exactly like a plae lager, and nothing like a bock. Nice beer, but absolutely not faithful to the style.

Estery too. Retronasal some pine-like flavour, and warming up strawberries and ginger. Well-bodied; slick & creamy mouthfeel. Burning sensation. I just don�t get it. They call themselves H.O.P., put a hopcone on the green label. If I read well, there�s 4 different hops in the beer. AND I CAN�T TASTE ANY of them. Also, Wyeast from the USA was used. Why not some tons of American hops, for a change (or a taste). Why are we so afraid of hops, for crying out loud?"

Fearless Scottish Ale;Estacada, Oregon, United States;Scottish Ale;Fearless Brewing Company;"""Don�t agree with the low scores. I tend to gravitate more towards the wee heavy strength scotch ales. While I like the lower abv ones, they�re just not as good 9 times out of 10. While i can�t speak to Fearless� Wee Heavy, i can say this was a solid and quite enjoyable brew that was better significantly than their IIPA. Caramel, toffee, light peat and slightly fruity. Smooth and drinkable, yet complex and pretty tasty."""

Fearless Porter;Estacada, Oregon, United States;Porter;Fearless Brewing Company;Not as dark in color when you think of a porter. Lots of hops in this one! Starts with a smooth smoky taste the sits on the tongue after the beer is gone waiting for the next sip, then the bitterness comes.

Fearless Strong Scotch Ale;Estacada, Oregon, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fearless Brewing Company;Tap. I figured that without coming on here to see other scores first that I had got a fucky pint. Bubblegum, bubblegum in a glass, man did this ever taste like ass. A ruby-orange thin headed waste of time, money and tastebuds was all I got. Watery bubblegum, likely from contaminated lines and not the fault of beer. I was really looking forward to this as I love the style but sadly will not get to try it again for a long time due to location.

Fearless Strong Scotch Ale;Estacada, Oregon, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Fearless Brewing Company;Had only time for ne pint at Fearless and happily they had a Scotch ale. Dark brown,, almost mahogany ale, small tan head , that ges very fast , leaving good laceing. Very little carbonation present. Very malty aroma, slightly roasty in character.Nice on a cold day. The taste again is on style full of lovelly maltiness, and warming alcohol, the alcohol is detectable but it actually lends something to the beer , rather than detracts. Its not quite as sweet as sme Scotch ales, but still in style. Very nice stuff. Good mouthful, like a good Scotch the mouthfeel is not thick,but nice and smooth. Very good drinkability for one so strong. Wish i had the cash for a Growler.

Nice honey aroma is prominent with caramel malt passion-fruit & floral hoppy aromas. Mild to moderate sweet with good bitterness, light saltiness in the finish.

Alpine Beer Company Willy;Alpine, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Alpine Beer Company (CA);Can taken away from Beerfly, Bedford. Light yellow, a bit cloudy. Floral aroma with vanilla and almond extract character. Sweet with diet cream soda and gummy, gluey resin. Long vanilla finish. Medium carbonation. Just okay.
Alpine Beer Company Willy;Alpine, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Alpine Beer Company (CA);(Can) This beer disappointed me. Flavor-wise it's okay: lightly sweet and sour, only minimal bitterness. Slight metallic taste in the finish. Very full-bodied: thick, and with a strongly fizzy carbonation. Aroma is uninteresting...not much in the way of hops, and it also lacks the fruity and spicy notes typical of wheat beers. In spite of the low ABV, the alcohol is very evident when drinking it, and I dont' like that. Tastes heavy and bready, and I feel bogged down after drinking it...not the sort of beer I would want to drink more than one of unless I was hungry and wanting something more substantial.

Rodenbach Redbach;Roeselare, Belgium;Flavored - Fruit;Brouwerij Rodenbach (Swinkels Family Brewers);"The missing link between Rodenbach Alexander from the nineties and Rodenbach Rosso which was launched recently; this version existed from 2004 to 2007. It consisted of 4/5 young Rodenbach and 1/5 sugared cherry juice and was aimed at a young audience - hence the somewhat gimmicky bottle with screw cork and the totally gimmicky, flattened glassware in which it was supposed to be served. I remember this as a darkish red brown beer with very sweet, sugary, cherry jam-like onset revealing more sourishness and woodiness (real �Rodenbachness�, so to speak) towards the end, not unlike the long-gone Alexander; a weird tomato aroma kind of disturbed me, though. It was discontinued due to lack of success, I wish the brewery all the luck with their Rosso now, but there is no doubt this kind of compromized attempts at popularizing Rodenbach are to be looked upon as a commercial necessity to help keeping the �real� thing (including the Grand Cru, Vintage and other versions) alive - and for such an important beer family, I quite obviously can have nothing against that."

Laurelwood Hop Juice;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);This is a pretty good IPA. Good colour, good taste. If you hold your nose up to it, you will notice the smell of yeast. Then, you will begin to taste it. Overall a good beer.
Laurelwood Hop Juice;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Dark orange pour, somewhat hazy. Strong aroma of floral, dry hops. Some earthiness in the flavor. Grapefruit, flowery, lightly toasted malt. The finish is lingering and hoppy, very rewarding IPA.
Laurelwood Hop Juice;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Man oh man, the name couldn�t be more accurate. This was a hop monstrosity, almost too much for me to take. But I survived, and I would like to try it again.
Laurelwood Hop Juice;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Golden amber color with a white head. Strong hopped aroma. Taste started malty with a nice bitter finish. There was something in the taste that i couldn�t quite grasp, so my best guess was almost a perfume taste. Nice smooth mouthfeel.
Laurelwood Hop Juice;Portland, Oregon, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Laurelwood Public House & Brewery (Legacy Breweries);Gold copper color, light head & lacing. The aroma is full of hops, sterling or amarillo, very earthy but bright & clean. The flavor has a good amount of bitterness but not what I was expecting for 101 IBUs. A weird dry basil aftertaste with a full mouthfeel.
BJ's Wild Thing;Huntington Beach, California, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;Light hazy blonde with copper color, a ring of head & lacing. The aroma has some light belgian yeast & a floral sweet hop note. The flavor is yeast with some tangy malt finish and a dry body.
Bluegrass Velvet Hammer;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Black brew that shows a garnet heart when held to the light. Toffee nose. Medium body. Decent roasted flavor with some milk chocolate notes. Not as full flavored as I would prefer but still very good.
Bluegrass Velvet Hammer;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bluegrass Brewing Company;"thx hopsrus dark brown color, medium body, flavor has toffee sweetnes, a very ""easy drinking"" imperial"
Bluegrass Velvet Hammer;Louisville, Kentucky, United States;Stout - Imperial;Bluegrass Brewing Company;Dark, rich color, not quite black, but very dark brown. Flavor is roasted, coffee and chocolate. Flavor has a fair amount of acidity, and the body isn�t as thick as some Imps are. These are my only critizisms of the beer. Pretty good all in all. The best beer I�ve had from BBC.
Rocky River Patriot Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);On tap @ RR for the Cleveland micro crawl: White head on a medium amber body. Head is a little short lived. Light herbal hop and caramel malt in the aroma, and very little fruitiness. The flavor is balanced to bitterness, but has a little caramel & toasty malt flavor to keep it from being overly bitter. Very low fruitiness in the flavor(green apple). Finish is semi dry and a little resiny hop flavored. M/f is lightly astringent, medium carbonation, and lighter medium body. I originally thought this was an amber, but I see that this is a pale ale. I guess the bitterness could be acceptable for a Pale, but it�s still a little too resiny for my liking. A little lighter on flavor than most Pales
Rocky River Patriot Ale;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Rocky River Brewing Co. (OH);Deep red color. Foamy white head. Green, piney nose that is a hint spicey. Nice malty body that is quite well balanced, even a bit restrained. Hops are mainly what you get in this one, though. Not overly bitter, but the hops are surely there. A touch of spicey hop zing on the finish. There�s a slight anise flavor that lingers for a while after you swallow. Not all that intresting, but a good session ale.
La Barberie Stout au Caf� �quitable;Qu�bec, Quebec, Canada;Stout;Microbrasserie La Barberie;Pours an almost opaque brown letting through a faint ruby hue, topped by two fingers of coarse beige head showing good retention and some nice chunky lacing. Very appealing visually. The nose is dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, some brown sugar and touch of herbs. The taste follows the path with a balanced sweetness with the torrefied malts and the same touch of herbal hops and the end. Medium-bodied, the brew is dense and satisfying. Cheers!
McMenamins Galena IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;Had this tonight at Thompsons Brewpub. All i can say that it was a very drinkable if simple IPA. And that Mcmens beers never truly die
McMenamins Galena IPA;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;OnTap at McMenamins Kennedy SchoolGolden lightly hazy color with a light creamy white head. The aroma has a peppery dose of hops & some 2-row. The flavor is bitter but comes off as tangy due to all the malt in the foundation. Finishes medium bodied and roudned. Not bad.
McMenamins Garnet Porter;Portland, Oregon, United States;Porter;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;OnTap at McMenamins Kennedy SchoolDark walnut cherry color with some opaque hazyness. Tan creamy head with good lacing. The aroma is roasty with some chocolate & espresso notes. The flavor is creamy with light roast and a good mocha finish. This is very similar to the magic cup porter but they said it was different.
Castle Rock Cuckoo Pint;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham. Soft, flattish pint, which was pale in colour and headless. Flowery, milky fruit flavour. Light and tongue coating. OK.
Castle Rock Bank Vole;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Pale, straw colour. A rather unusual golden ale as it is dominated by dry malt, rather than crisp hoppiness. There�s some diacetyl butterscotch in the aroma which, fortunately, dissipated quite quickly. As Joe and Duff remarked, the malt is rather raw and underdeveloped. OK but either weird, or out of condition. As only about a third of the beers were actually available on this, the first day of the festival, I�d opt for the latter. Cask (gravity) at Twickenham Beer Festival.
Castle Rock Bank Vole;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Castle Rock Brewery;Cask@Twickenham BF.

Clarks Mulberry Tree;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask (handpump), Last Drop, York, October 2006. Mid gold colour. Not the most assertive or aromatic golden ale but there are some nice hops in there, with hints of melons, lychees and tropical fruit. Smooth and quite fresh mouthfeel.

Clarks Code Red;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);First tasted this in the Three Judges, Glasgow in September 2005. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear pale amber in colour with a thin white head. Slight hint of soft caramel on the nose. Thin resiny mouthfeel and good lacing. Mixed malts give a maltloaf base laced with syrupy raisins, caramel, dark berry fruits. Strong hop resins in the bitter aftertaste. Finish is slightly sweet with redcurrants evident.

Clarks Christmas Moon;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask conditioned @ Giddy Bridge (JDW), Soton. Some slightly floral hop and delicate malt but little flavour to interest. However despite being quite thin a suprisingly creamy body (not served via a sparkler) and quite drinkable.
Clarks Christmas Moon;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask (handpump), Penderels Oak (JDW), Holborn. More of a session bitter than a Christmas beer. Copper colour. Slightly sharp and very dry. An unusual mix of loads of dry malt and equally prominent citric hops. there�s not much depth to the flavour, but it really develops a lot more attack on the finish. The aftertaste is very dry, significantly astringent and lasts for ever. So, whilst it may be a session bitter, its certainly a distinctive one.
Clarks Christmas Moon;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask at the Alexandra Hotel, Derby. Mid-brown, weak body, thin fruits but all rather moreish. Perhaps it�s that tang that Deep Black mentioned.

Clarks Two Jags;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask handpull at Market Porter. Pale copper with sparse head. Yeasty hoppy aroma with some caramel. Earthy, hoppy juicy in mouth. Earthy finish. Hop is good. But like the last couple of beers here, I think that the condition could be better.
Clarks Two Jags;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Pale, hoppy, lemony beer with more citrus in the finish than is good for it, giving it a hint of a certain lemony washing-up liquid - not that I drink washing up liquid, mind. But you get the idea. (Cask @ New Britannia, Preston)
Clarks Sherwoods Best Bitter;Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Westgate Brewery (prev Clarks Brewery);Cask @ White Horse, Hedgerly, UK Quite sulfury, orange colour. Yeasty and soomewhat hazy. Even all that, it is still quite refreshing.

Star Lager (Ghana);Kumasi, Ghana;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Guinness Ghana Breweries;June 2016 - Bottle share at Scopey�s. As �Star Lager�, the version brewed in Ghana. Many thanks to Dave for this glorious Ghanaian gift. Dark yellow, clear, still, small foamy head. Aroma is weeeeed, skunky, papery, touch of chlorine maybe. Body is light, spritzy carbonation, a little foamy. Taste is soft cracker malts, papery, sodawater, some sweetcorn notes. Like many beers consumed purely for the country tick, this doesn�t taste great. Actually, it�s predictably below average. But I guess I can say I�ve had a beer made in Ghana. Cheers Dave!

Town Hall Bug Dope Kolsch;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;"Clear glowing straw gold color, small based whitish firm cap, minimal spotty lacing. Aroma is quite nice, dullish sweet malt and pale malt, a touch candish, not all that strong, but very nice to take in, clean, mild, fresh, fruity, with a baked honey wheat bread quality. Taste is just as nice as the smell would leave you to believe, very well handled malt profile, dullish, mild sweetness that brings in fresh bread dough; slick and chewy in some regards. Honeyish and candy-like without the sugars. Very inticing little flavor nuances located throughout. Touches of hops delicately breach the finishing area with calm grassy/floral notes. Its effortless smoothness and easy taste just begs to be drank. Easy going, creamy smooth feel, lightly carbonated with a certain textured give in areas. Solid medium body and quite quaffable."
Town Hall Bug Dope Kolsch;Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery;I haven�t had Koelsch in a very long time. I spent a year in Bonn (good neighbor to Cologne, home of Koelsch) and drank more Altbier than anything else. I say this to say that my rating is not based on comparison to the style. Beyond that, this is one well made beer. The appearance is Grain Belt, but looks are definitely deceiving! The nose whispers vegetables and soft semi-sweetness. The taste supports this verbatim. Crisp, and CLEAN, the vegetal elements are softened by the memory of sweetness. The growler is holding up nicely. Try this, another Town Hall success story.

Pours a grainy, murky pale amber with a dense, rocky, light tan head. Nice toasty, bready, husky cereal nose of wheat. A bit of sweet spiciness there as well. Creamy body with plenty of grain. Lots of forward wheat notes, with hints of honey and spice at the edges. Refreshing and drinkable. Nice stuff.

Walking Man IPA;Stevenson, Washington, United States;IPA;Walking Man Brewing;Growler - Kind of an orange/amber color to it. Nice white head as well. Not much nose on it at all. Only a small bitter bit for an IPA. It doesn�t knock your teeth in which is nice but does have enough hops to stand on its own as an IPA. I can see why this is their flagship IPA. Nothing very offensive about this beer but also nothing that challenges the palate. A great all around beer and certainly something you can drink regularly which is a good options. If you want something challenging you need to look elsewhere.

Walking Man Barefoot Brown;Stevenson, Washington, United States;Brown Ale;Walking Man Brewing;Tap... Poured dark ruby with NO head. Faint, malt aroma. Tasted like a straight up, mellow amber ale. Candy and malt dominate the flavors and with minimal hops. Also tasted like it was brewed with sulfur water. This one fell short for me for being from Walking Man. Maybe it was a bad tap.

This beer pours to a beautiful, bright, chestnut brown color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a good carbonation. The nose on this beer is very inviting, with good aromas of nutty and toasty malt, paired with some piney hops. The palate is firm with good sweet and nutty malt flavor, This beer finishes with really good nutty malt flavors up front, then ends with a nice piney smack of hop bitterness that lingers. Excellent example of American Brown Ale. I really enjoyed the malt and hop character of this beer, and both shine in this beer. A nice session beer, and a very food friendly one as well.

Greenwich Summer Beer;New York, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;Greenwich Brewing Co.;A rather metallic american wheat from the sad, sad brewery on 6th Ave @ 9th St. It makes me want to cry when I visit this place and their beers change about as often as the U.S. changes it�s Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Bell's Whistles Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Bell's Brewery;Whistler�s ale is a fantastic unfiltered Irish Ale - cloudy red, makes you think a bit of iron oxide in water, but not orangey. Grain husk aroma, slightly acrid and smoky. Very fresh and clean, very biscuity/toasty, but grainier - very little hop presence or sweetness. Not as sharp at Great Lakes Conway. Delicious and a reall session ale - had on tap with Heather and lids and the new in-laws.
Bell's Whistles Ale;Comstock, Michigan, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Bell's Brewery;On tap at the Eccentric Cafe. Bells continues to impress- their foray into Irish Ales has produced my favorite example to date. This beer poured a hazy orange-brown color, topped by a thin cream-colored head. Strong toast/cheerios and chocolate aroma. Dry and cerealy. Flavor is likewise extremely toasty and grainy with chocolate notes in addition to just a touch of caramel and fruit. Medium-bodied with nice complexity, this beer is packed with flavor for 4.5% ABV. Another welcome addition to the Bells lineup- this should be bottled.
Bell's Hopslam;Comstock, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bell's Brewery;Beautiful golden clear pour with lively carbonation and dense off white head. The name doesn't lie. Truly an epic hop bomb of all characters, some resin, some florals, but overall smooth and very bitter. Full bodied and the honey is subtle but present. Long aftertaste, very aromatic, excellent!
Bell's Hopslam;Comstock, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bell's Brewery;12oz can at home. Pours a deep gold almost amber colour with a large pillowy white head. Aroma is grapefruit, tropical fruit, some caramel. Flavour is hoppy yes, but there�s a sweetness from the honey that�s a little too tough. It�s very good and very complex but I think some of the hype has made this be such a highly rated beer.
Bell's Hopslam;Comstock, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bell's Brewery;Soso. I have had better beers. Tremendously overrated. Ok. Just very overrated.
Bell's Hopslam;Comstock, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bell's Brewery;Goos grief this is good. I usually avoid high hop beer but HopSlam is hop abundant without the in your face kick. Potent so stay at home with your 6 pack.

Bell's Hopslam;Comstock, Michigan, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Bell's Brewery;Can 12oz. Pours a clear medium amber with a light creamy head. Aromas pop of floral honey/hops, citrus, fruity. Flavors citrus, floral, pine, slight alcohol in the nose. High bitterness, dry, medium sweetness. Overall after all the DIPAs I've tried for so many years this DIPA doesn't as far as my palate is concerned stand out as the best. It is very good yes, but not better than several DIPAs I've tried. Perhaps a little overrated. Very well done overall just a little over hyped. I will need to try this again in a glass bottle and check the date. I may have had an outdated can.
Ellicott Mills British IPA;Ellicott City, Maryland, United States;IPA;Ellicott Mills Brewing;Draft, and this was the highlight of the trip. Poured copper with off-white head.

Brick Bambay;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Waterloo Brewing Company;Originally rated September 2005. Guess I poured this brew down too fast. Gave me a big fat white head that is creamy and heavy thick in lacing. Pretty good retention. Killed the carbonation though that I found in the bottles. Colour is a cloudy golden with amber highlights. Very nice citrus scent, specially grapefruit, and once the brew breathes... malt is detected mildly. The taste is fruity on the citrus side as well, with grapefruit in the forefront and a touch of honey. Really not too sweet, but just right. Extremely refreshing and very low in alcohol.... I could drink many of these, like I did tonight after buying this six pack at the LCBO.
Brick Bambay;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Waterloo Brewing Company;I had it as a friend got it for his wife to try (she hates beer) and she said it still tasted like beer... It may as well be fermented orangina. Perhaps after a day of back breaking labour out in the back yard but only if you are too lazy to make yourself a radler (sorry.. shandy). Suffice it to say that I�m glad I didn�t pay for it.. It has its place as a beer cocktail but to call it a fruit beer is a bit more of a stretch then I would really be willing to make..
Brick Bambay;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Waterloo Brewing Company;341ml bottle from the LCBO in Belleville, Ontario. Golden yellow in colour, very thin white head, small amounts of lacing. The aroma is very sweet and sugary, light citrus. The flavour is fruity, juicy with a noticable grapefruit syrupyness. Coating mouthfeel, medium/light body, medium carbonation. Finishes quite sweet and lingering. Experiment gone wrong. No Best Before date.
Brick Bambay;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Waterloo Brewing Company;If someone asked me to brew up something that tastes like the product of an unholy union between a soda pop and a nondescript malt beverage, this would be my target brew. I could rant on about the genuinely artificial flavors, but why belabor the point? This isn�t beer.
Brick Bambay;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Waterloo Brewing Company;Singles bin at LCBO- Cloudy yellow pour with a big fizzy white head. Minute lace. Fruity, mostly grapefruit and other citrus aromas, with some bread. Taste is sweet citrus, again, mostly grapefruit with sugar on it. Slightly cloying, but better than expected.
Brick Bambay;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Waterloo Brewing Company;Grapefruit aroma, hazy yellow, pours a big ,short lived white head, leaves some lace too. Taste is grapefruit (I�ve had worse apricot wheat beers) Very sweet, but oddly enjoyable, I wouldn�t say refreshing though. Not too bad, better than expected.
Brick Bambay;Kitchener, Ontario, Canada;Flavored - Fruit;Waterloo Brewing Company;First bottle out of a basket of fruit beers from Mr_Kimchee. Smells like grapefruit juice. Good starting head is quickly gone. Cloudy gold beer. Too much sweetness and the beer is syrupy rather than fruity. I expected fruit juice and beer and ended up with a pound of sugar on red grapefruit half. The other raters� references to soda pop are bang on.
Boulder Creek Indian Pale Ale;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;Draught at Boulder Creek Brewpub. Pale orange with no head. Orange and lemon nose, with a bit of diacetyl and grain. Sweet flavor of orange and lemon, soda-like with a bitter finish. Cloying. Not very good at all.

Boulder Creek Indian Pale Ale;Boulder Creek, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Boulder Creek Brewing Company;Had this one after many rounds. Need to try again. Not a bad Pale Ale but nothing special.
Buckeye Sierra Blanca;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Buckeye Brewing Company;Pretty big nose, with lots of odd, non Belgian wit aromas coming at me. Citrus mixed with wheat, soft banana yeast, and an odd almost rootbeer note. Full bodied and tasty. Lots of flowery stuff on the palate. Gets to be a bit much after a while, though. Crisp finish. Tasty and pretty different.
Buckeye Sierra Blanca;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Buckeye Brewing Company;Spicy citrus aroma - big, but could be bigger. Body is full flavored, wheat and malty, orange peel, lots of corriander and a fantastic peppery finish (which I found out is from the cardamom that the brewer threw in on a whim). The peppery hoppy finish gives this a feel of a Wit/Pilsner. The finish was spicy and lingered with an orange juice sweetness. I had a growler of this - I�ll need more, it�s quite refreshing! (Lisa says the spice reminds her of Old Bay - this would taste great with a pound of spiced shrimp at Awful Arthurs on OBX)
Buckeye Sierra Blanca;Lakewood, Ohio, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Buckeye Brewing Company;"Hazy deep gold w/ a lasting white head (as long as the glass is not just cleaned). Banana esters and orange citrus dominate the intial aroma; light coriander & wheat malt follow. Flavor is well balanced, but has a distinctive orange juice flavor and a hop flavored finish that is also wheat malt, dry, & lightly tart in the aftertaste. Higher carbonation, lighter body, but slightly astringent. This seems to be a seasonal w/ Buckeye and it�s a nice change from the norm. Flavorful and more refreshing than their standard line, but not quite truly Belgian. Not a big issue in my book!"
Star Brewery Northern Star Bitter (Pasteurised);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;440ml can at Kookfest, September 2006. You might expect a 2.1% canned bitter to taste like fizzy piss. But you�d be wrong there. Piss would actually have some flavour. This has nothing except a vague hint of metal. Has an almost Alka-Seltzer feel, no doubt from the force carbonation. The colour is amber. Distinctly unpleasant.
Star Brewery Northern Star Bitter (Pasteurised);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;Can. Pretty nasty stuff. Weak, watery, bland, with a very rusty/tinny flavour coming through from start to finish. There are some slight hop/malt characters, but this pretty much has no flavour. Fizzy.

Star Brewery Northern Star Bitter (Pasteurised);Mellor Brook, Lancashire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Thwaites Brewery;Cheap tinned beer from the Co-op. Very thin and tight. Watery.

Basil Ts Italian Pale Ale;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Artisan's Brewery and Italian Grill;I believe this is the pale ale they were serving. Very dry, perhaps overcarbonated APA. Passable but not something to seek out, there are just so many good beers for this style.
Basil Ts Italian Pale Ale;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Artisan's Brewery and Italian Grill;Hooper Pale Ale-pours a gold color. Aroma is mild hops. Taste is hops and dry, but light on the carbonation.
Basil Ts Italian Pale Ale;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Artisan's Brewery and Italian Grill;I liked this batch. Has a nice head with a bitter hop aroma. The taste is very smooth and balanced with nice hop kick to it. A little watery and not as high gravity as you�d expect from an IPA.
Basil Ts Italian Pale Ale;Toms River, New Jersey, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Artisan's Brewery and Italian Grill;Too much bitterness, somewhat watery.

Beer Works Hub Light;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Beer Works;Draft at Canal St location. My least favorite from the second sampler we ordered on this day. Crystal clear color that only offered light grain and mild corn. Even for a golden ale this is a very weak showing. No off flavors simply because it doesn�t have much noticeable flavor at all. Super watery body with hints of rice, corn and the weakest pale grain. Finish literally is water.

Beer Works Don Pedro Cerveza;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Beer Works;I can�t believe a brewpub would make such an atrocity.

This is the first beer from a brewer that I have on no level liked whatsoever
Beer Works Don Pedro Cerveza;Boston, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Beer Works;Looks like a pale lager off the tap. Light, no head, with a lime. Taste is water and hints of lime. Very weak stuff. Not for me again.

A lime wedge sits firmly across the rim of the glass until I ripped it off and threw it onto my bread plate. The aroma has a distinct citrus lime character if you can believe it.

Grand Union K�lsch Style;Hayes, Greater London, England;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Grand Union;Cask @ Crosse Keys: Clear light yellow, almost looks like a perry! Mild fruit aroma, apple juice there too. Flavour is green apples, with a touch of malt. Very estery, and undrinkable. Dissapointing!
Grand Union K�lsch Style;Hayes, Greater London, England;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Grand Union;[Cask at GBBF 2004] A yellow beer with no head. The aroma is sweet - plain and simple. The flavor is sweet with notes of caramel and peach, leading to a dry hoppy end - a weird flavor - not a K�lsch in my universe.
Grand Union K�lsch Style;Hayes, Greater London, England;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Grand Union;Gravity at Olde Dolphin Inn Beer Festival, Derby. Very pale gold, hint of sweetness, missed it at Derby CAMRA festival so glad to get it here. Easy going, flavoursome stuff.
Grand Union K�lsch Style;Hayes, Greater London, England;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Grand Union;Cask conditioned - Gravity - Derby BF. Obviously a better batch than that which went to Catford.

Grand Union K�lsch Style;Hayes, Greater London, England;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Grand Union;Pale gold colour slightly hazy. Sweet malt aroma, with some sweaty green hop notes. Not much in the way of flavour. Mouthfeel is thin and watery and the finish is dull. If this is how Kolsch is supposed to taste, I don�t like it. I�m sure this wasn�t in peak condition, so I need to give this another try if the opportunity arises. I have marked up a little to reflect this. Cask (gravity), Catford Beer Festival. [2.6] RE-RATE: GBBF 2004. Having got chatting to the brewer, and having been doubtful of the condition at Catford, I thought I ought to give this another go. It was certainly showing much better at GBBF. Not a lot of aroma, but clean, fresh and easy drinking, if not exactly packed with flavour. But I guess that�s the style, and I have to say it�s not my favourite. This certainly compared OK with the few other examples I�ve tried. I�d better try a visit to Koln to see if I enjoy Kolsch more there.
Grand Union K�lsch Style;Hayes, Greater London, England;K�lsch / K�lsch-Style;Grand Union;Bottled bright from the Catford Beer Festival. Thin pale yellow colour. Cider / Granny Smith apple aroma. Apple flavour followed by a delayed fish kicker. Very odd. The lads said it wasn�t much good and they were right.

Faultline Belgian White;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Faultline Brewing Company;Sample at the brewpub on 8/10/10. Pours clearish yellow with a thin white head. Orange aroma with coriander and some banana, but the banana doesn�t dominate. Flavor also starts with orange and has a bit of tartness before some banana steps in, leading to a dry herbal finish. Very nice for a style that�s very hit or miss for me.
Faultline Belgian White;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Faultline Brewing Company;A little sweeter aroma than your average wit. Also perhaps I�ve beenhaving more hefes but this one seems a touch more opaque than normal. The flavor is nice a kittle more bitter than usual which balanced it out.
Faultline Belgian White;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Faultline Brewing Company;On tap at the brewpub. Pours cloudy yellow with a thin white head and a floral aroma. There is a thin wheat flavor that is refreshing but almost tasteless, with a litttle banana ester.

Touch of corn, perfumey coriander, and light cinnamon in the aroma. The flavor is perfumey and floral with plenty of coriander showing. Peppery spice and orange hang in the background. Medium sweet.

Faultline Brown Ale;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Brown Ale;Faultline Brewing Company;This brew had a sweet aroma kinda malty an you would expect. It was very clear and a medium brown color. The taste was a good bitter sweet combo good caremel and maybe a bit of chocolate malt. It has a light medium body, overall not bad.
Faultline Brown Ale;Sunnyvale, California, United States;Brown Ale;Faultline Brewing Company;Tap. This was one of those beers that had an attractive maltiness at first (i.e., in the sample glass) but when I ordered a pint of it, I stopped liking it about halfway through. Something about the mouthfeel and aftertaste just ruined this stuff in spite of the decent initial impression.
Bank Top Old Slapper;Bolton, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Bank Top Brewery;Cask. Pours golden brown with white top. Aroma bland. Taste similar with some fruit to start and a gradually souring finish. A forgettable beer in a very crowded field.

Scotch Irish Entire Butt Porter;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Kichesippi Beer Company;Deep brown, tan head. Pretty roasty nose, light though. Flavor is quite interesting, light roast, some sourness, some milk, and a bit of fruit. An odd combination but it works well. The milky sourness detracts a bit from the palate. Good though.
Scotch Irish Entire Butt Porter;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Kichesippi Beer Company;Pours deep red/brown with a little soapy tan head. Toasted aroma with a bit of wood smoke. Very sour, with some salty residuals. A nice amount of smoke carries through the flavours. Apples and lemon fruits. Balanced sweet malts and souring hops. Maybe some yeast shows itself. The most interesting beer at the festival.
Scotch Irish Entire Butt Porter;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Kichesippi Beer Company;Not too drinkable, but change of pace. Mildly carbonated. Nice dark appearance and coffee roasty licorice aroma. Complex tastes of citrus and chocolate from malt, and sourness from the Irish hops.
Scotch Irish Entire Butt Porter;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Kichesippi Beer Company;Another draught from the Toronto Fest 2004. I haven�t had the Black Irish Plain Porter so I can�t make any comparison. I think this is a solid beer though. Beautiful black in appearance with a tan head. Potent roasty malt aroma with lots of coffee essence. Silky smooth and finishes with a good bitterness level. Flavourful and complex. Solid stuff.

Scotch Irish Entire Butt Porter;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Kichesippi Beer Company;Ok. Remember Ralph Harwood, and the creation of the entire butt. This was actually OK. Seemed like a blast from the past. A real throwback. Mixed well with the apparent marketing push to further the port style to an ever pensive listless audience.
Scotch Irish Entire Butt Porter;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Porter;Kichesippi Beer Company;Fort York 2004 Dark black with a big milk chocate coloured head. Aroma has sweet malt and some nutty chocolate notes with a barely noticeable undercurrent of acidity. Flavour profile is still very acidicly sour, but is far more palatable and drinkable than the previous sample. Malty up front with a lingering sourness in the finish. Palate is on the light side. Draft. St. Lawrence Festival Special. Black with a decent head it looks quite nice. I was distracted by the dark ashen sour acidity and didn�t get my taste buds in order enough to really pick it apart. The maltiness wa concealed too far below for me and left an odd lingering aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit light, but adequate. I went back to try it again on Sunday and they didn�t have any. Interesting beer I can�t quite wrap me head or my tastebuds around. I much prefer the samples of their regular porter I have had. 6/4/4/3/12

Scotch Irish Glengarry 90 Shilling;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Scottish Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;OK, for the record...basically the beer was the wort for Sgt Major�s, fermented with an different yeast, and not dry-hopped. So it came out in something not dissimilar to Scottish ale. Light bronze. Chewy, with a good bitter backbone from those high cohumulone Chinooks. Toffeeish, with slightly leafy, tobaccoey notes. Not bad, but not especially cohesive.
Scotch Irish Glengarry 90 Shilling;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada;Scottish Ale;Kichesippi Beer Company;A nice scotch ale from Scotch Irish! Dark orange colour, big off-white head. Lots of whiskey-like hints in the aroma. Strong malt taste, more hints of whiskey and lots of hops in the finish. I thought perhpas it was a little unbalanced at times but overall, a solid brew.

Russell Honey Blonde Ale;Surrey, British Columbia, Canada;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Russell Brewing Company;Can shared with mabel & jerc. Clear golden with a small white head. Aroma seems off, tart and a bit cheesy. Dirty yeast strain, maybe? Or infected? Flavour is oddly sweet & sour, with a strong lemon character (so much so that I checked to make sure I hadn�t poured the lemon ale by mistake), and a short, tart finish. Not very nice.

Boggart Light Mild;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Mild Ale;Boggart Hole Clough;Light brown colour. It has an unusual (foe a mild), slightly hoppy, resinous aroma. There is some caramel and dry malt in the flavour but, without the roasted character, I found it a bit thin and dull. Overall, OK, but not too exciting. To be fair, I�ve not really been blown away by any of the light milds I�ve tried, which I feel a bit guilty about because its such a rare style these days. Cask (handpump), Head of Steam, Euston, London.
Boggart Light Mild;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Mild Ale;Boggart Hole Clough;Cask conditioned - handpump - Evening Star Brighton.

Ossett Silver Ghost;Ossett, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ossett Brewery;Catford Fest. Gravity. Light gold colour. Crude. Not great. Dry. Undeveloped. Spiesy�s joined us with his big man tits.
Ossett Silver Ghost;Ossett, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ossett Brewery;"Ossett specialises in beers with ""Silver"" in the title. Most are very hoppy indeed. This is indeed a pale beer, but the hops are rather green and undeveloped. Without a crisp, rasping hop rush, the beer seems rather hollow as there are no other distinctive elements. Perhaps not in peak condition. Cask (gravity), Catford Beer Festival."
Ossett Silver Ghost;Ossett, West Yorkshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Ossett Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Catford Beer Festival, 2004. Very pale yellow colour, approaching clear.

Leyden Raglan Sleeve;Bury, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Leyden;Cask Stillage at the Howcroft Inn, Bolton 11/10/2003 Dark coloured and slightly sweet with some wheat flavour. Some dryness in a lasting finish.
Leyden Raglan Sleeve;Bury, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Leyden;Deep reddish mahogany colour. The aroma is mainly malt and caramel. Contrary to the description, I did not discern any substantial hop impact on the nose. The palate is sweetish, with distinct coffee and toffee notes. The hops come through late, but the finish is still rather soft. Interesting and quite complex, but, for me, not entirely successful. But I do prefer my bitters to have a more assertive bitterness, so others may see it differently. Cask (gravity), Thurrock Beer Festival

Manayunk Amarillo American Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Manayunk Brewing Company;Had this from a keg at a going away party for a friend who works at the brewery.

Manayunk Amarillo American Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Manayunk Brewing Company;I don�t know what these guys were doing with this stuff but it didn�t taste like a hefe. It tastes like a lager-amber mix. No yeasty, wheat taste. I was looking forward to a good hefe on that hot day at Stoudts.
Manayunk Amarillo American Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Manayunk Brewing Company;Not a good beer at all, the appearance was alright with a hazy & slightly cloudy gold color, the nose was a bit sour which led to the awlful flavors, way off base, very little wheat qualities at all
Manayunk Amarillo American Wheat;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;Wheat Ale;Manayunk Brewing Company;Opaque gold color with a small white head, some lacing. Clean citrus wheat aroma.

Khean Leg Spinner;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Khean;Bottled. Cloudy orange/gold in appearance. Aromas are sweet caramel and sulphur. Flavours are soft malts with a blast of fruit sourness. Some caramel malts and floral hops are also present. The finish is long and chalky dry (and sticks to the roof of the mouth). Decent enough.
Khean Leg Spinner;Congleton, Cheshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Khean;Pale amber/gold colour. Impaired by a heavy sulphur aroma. The palate was quite soft and the finish a bit flabby. There were some hops in there, but their impact was muted. Not in top condition, I think, so this deserves another chance. Cask (gravity), Thurrock Beer Festival

Brew City Ice (Big City Ice);La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Could this be Natty�s bastard cousin? I think it just might. Terrible flavor. Average appearance. Not much of a smell.
Brew City Ice (Big City Ice);La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);16oz can Pours clear golden with a white head and an aroma of corn and blah. Taste of grains and corn. This light bodied brew was pretty nasty.
Brew City Ice (Big City Ice);La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Straw color with a rather large and lasting white head. Minimal nose, with some scents of corn flour paste and touch of herbal hops. Rather dull feel, but nothing too offensive. Sweet grain and corn flavors. Some white grape and mild alcohol also in the mix. I think I detected a bit of malt for fleeting moment in the linger between quaffs, but far to brief to be memorable. I like tiggmtl comment of an inoffensive alcohol delivery system, but I do find a few things less than inoffensive.
Brew City Ice (Big City Ice);La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"This liquid has the distinguished honor of being the most foul ""beer"" I have ever tasted."
Brew City Ice (Big City Ice);La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Golden/amber color. Almost no head when poured. Odor of alcohol is overwhelming. The box it came in looked like a re-labeled shoe box. Drinkability is very low as every sip gives a very offensive taste.
Brew City Ice (Big City Ice);La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Smells terrible. It is a crappy beer along the lines of natty. Its only saving grace is the fact that it is slightly better than Natty. Of course when you get that bad, it is really just splitting hairs.
Brew City Ice (Big City Ice);La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Has a little bit of a bite to it. Very alcoholic aftertaste. Big bang for the buck but that bang isn�t a real good one.

Clear golden color. Head was white and disappeared quickly. Smelled of hay and husky grain. Flavor was similarly unappealing; grainy and salty (yes salty). It burned the back of my throat a bit as it went down."
Brew City Ice (Big City Ice);La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);12 oz silver and blue can. Had this before and found it difficult to stomach. Cheap, 33 cents per can at the Beer 4 Less in Moon. Looks like any other pale yellow american lager. I really didn�t want to taste this but the opportunity presented itself. Pop the lid and you get a whiff of sweet hints, it is pretty strong, maybe sweet corn. Odd, but I think I smell raw meat, too! Then, when you pour it into the glass the smell gets a little like acrid rotten corn. Taste is a little unexpected for a lager but right up the alley for an ice or inexpensive malt liquor. Difficult to enjoy is an understatement. I guess I should be ashamed for rating such a brew. I see there are only 21 ratings posted. The taste is a little harder than one would expect, a little rocky, mind you. Coarse to say the least. That funky ring of a head shows itself every drink from the foam that rises within. Finish has little alcohol hiding ability. I have read other raters write about �corn� and this definately is more cornlike than any other beer I�ve rated. Would not care to purchase this again. Industrial beer that can do the expecting job if drunk quickly. Will not buy again, one of the worse economy beers I�ve tasted, and I am the economy beer expert. At first the corny smell and flavors are sweet and interestingly attractive - then it becomes almost vulgar. Somewhat similar on the taste scale as King lager from austrailia. Ice has become known in the lager arena to be higher in alky for the cheap american beers. High alky at the expense of a gentleman like lager taste.
M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);I don�t even know. What�s up with the ice minus the label? Well, more bitter, less grape, and just rougher. I have no idea what�s going on anymore.
M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Pours a golden color. Smell is of grains, plastics. Taste is grains, green apples, a touch of malts. Overall your average cheap lager.
M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"M-X Ice High Gravity Malt Liquor has a thick, white, quickly-dissipating head and a clear, yellow appearance, with lots of bubbles streaming up, and little-to-no lacing. The aroma is mostly water, with some sweetness and some grains. Taste is, again, water and sweetness (really this drink�s major characteristic), with a grape soda undertaste and even some hop bitterness thrown in, as a matter of course. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and M-X Ice finishes surprisingly crisp and refreshing. All of its characteristics scream, ""I�m NOT a malt liquor."" This is the most non-malt liquor malt liquor I�ve ever sampled. It�s much more similar to a lighter-than-average regular American-style lager. Weird. It�s okay, which is a surprise, because I was expecting the worst. RJT"
M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);24oz can, labeled black with HGL sticking out. Aroma of cooked corn on the cob. Deep gold color.

M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Appearance: Burps out a clear, yellow body with a foamy, white head. Smell: Seriously, why do I continue to subject myself to these things? Aroma of countertop cleaner, corn, one chicken bouillon cube, and those malt liquor floral hints that just smell fake and unearthy, like they were hastily cooked up in a lab. Taste: Off-puttingly sweet corn and chemi-floral flavors. Light alcohol throughout -- thankfully none of the sharp rubbing alcohol taste you find in these things. Another mouthful of corn nibs for the finish. Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. Medium carbonation. Drinkability: This was all kinds of awful, even for a malt liquor.
M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);for some reason i prefer steel reserve over m-x.... its still strong beer to get wasted on thats one extra point :P
M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can. Pours a surprisingly deep gold with a head that crawls up the glass like a 1-year-old along a kitchen floor. Flavor is a watery apple cider. Weird. Palate is watery, too. I guess I would kill more of these if I only had homies to share it with. Sigh.
M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);In the 24 oz master cylinder from the QuickTime in Platte City MO. This wicked little indulgence has an amoeboid whitye head that threatens to crawl as it has so much motion. Pale gold in color. CORN. There�s a lot of sweetness to the flavor. Maybe a cross between apple juice and a glucose tolerance test. The palate is existent, but it escapes taxonomy. It leaves behind a couple of BB dots of lacing, just to let you know that it is not water. The remarkable thing about this beer is the apple flavor. It is not crap, but it is very likely sinful to drink this stuff.
M-X Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Dark yellow color with no head. Same sour aroma I get from pretty much every malt liquor. Hmmm... this one tastes even more sour and trashed corn than most. Ugh.

Crouch Vale Topsail;South Woodham Ferrers, Essex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Crouch Vale Brewery;Brought to my work via a plastic carton. Aroma has crouch vale American hops written all over it super citrusy grassy hops. Taste has some pale malt/caramalt through the intence hop attack on the tougue.

Toasted grains, light coffee/chocolate with a hint of cola and sweet malt on the finish and some faint ash/tobacco in the aftertaste.

Durham White Magic;Bowburn, Durham, England;Strong Ale - English;Durham Brewery;"Bottle from an offie in Knaresborough, N. Yorks. Pours lager-like with a spiralling bead and massive, impractical whip of foam. Restrained aroma; lemony hay, banana and faint pears, green herbs (parsley), marmalade (it needs to stand, de-chill and settle for a good half hour before these aromas emerge). Flavour halfway between Duvel and White Shield; yeasty and delicately fruity in a decidedly European way (pear, banana, parsley and sherbet hints), with suggestions of custard, slate..and the pepperiness of booze. Finishes bluntly with bitterness and some of the rubber glove and almond qualities of an industrial strong lager. Mouthfeel mousse-like and spritzy. Ends up an uninteresting strong beer at the ABV; probably authentic and all but I�m seriously tempted to tip some Punk in it."

Storm Cream Ale;Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada;Cream Ale;Storm Brewing (BC);Amber in color with a sweet hoppy aroma. Balanced malt/hop with nice flavours from both and a tiny bit of earthyness in there.
Santa Barbara SFH (So Fn Hoppy);Santa Barbara, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Gooy, slopy resiny hops in the nsoe with a metric tone of caramel. Hop funk with more of that malt/caramel lovi to back it up. Citrus,, eaathy, herbal, grassy, all of hop flavors at once, Finnished bitter with yet more malt. Balanced is not quite the word Im looking for so much as it supports itself and no side becomes more overbearing then the next, it is all overbearing in a very good way.
Santa Barbara SFH (So Fn Hoppy);Santa Barbara, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Light amber in color, not much head and no lacing to speak of. Aroma is mostly hops, kind of citrusy, floral, and some pine notes, not as potent as some other IIPA�s that I�ve had. Strongly bitter flavor, tons of hops in there, not much else, but I love hoppy beers so I really enjoyed drinking it. Pretty one-dimensional flavor, not much malt or other flavors to speak of in my opinion. Hops dominate the finish. Didn�t even notice the 9.5% until it hit me 15 minutes later. I enjoyed drinking this a lot, but really lacking the powerful aroma and flavor profile of the Ruination, which remains one of my all-time favorites.

Hazy orange color with a thin head that mostly diminished and left little lacing. Malty aroma with citrus, pine hop notes. Sweet malty backbone, assertive citrusy, grapefruity and pine hop assault which is all yummy but just a bit harsh. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Nice full body and creamy carbonation make this one nice 2IPA.
Santa Barbara SFH (So Fn Hoppy);Santa Barbara, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Draft: O�Brien�s in San Diego, CA WOW! HUGE hop aroma- grassy, fruity, piney. Poured a nice orange/amber nice fluffy off-white head, nice trail of lacing. Much like Pliny, this beer is incredibly well balanced for a 2IPA. After the initial hop assault, the rich malt flavor starts to assert itself. I was initially put off by many of the 2IPA�s, but thanks to beers like SFH and Pliny this style is fast becoming a fave! My hat�s off to Eric @ SBB for a GREAT beer!
Santa Barbara SFH (So Fn Hoppy);Santa Barbara, California, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;"(Draft: O�Brien�s in San Diego, CA) Sweet, malty, fruity and well balanced by a strong, bitter hoppiness, but it�s not as crazy bitter or hoppy as some other 2IPAs; Not that those other 2IPAs are bad, because they�re awesome too, but this is just more balanced; The wonderful, multi-dimensional nose is piney and hoppy, but also quite fruity, balanced and very inviting; Deep amber color; Light tan head fades fast to a small ring and leaves minimal lacing"

Finish was mellow in the carbonation, the hops biting and the aftertaste quite dry, a good I2PA, but not really as strong as many doubles, drinkable none-the-less.

Spinnakers King Tuts Tipple;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Traditional Ale - Other;Spinnakers Brewpub;(660ml bottle) Thank god for RateBeer - I had no idea what this beer would have been classified as? A fruit beer huh? Pours a medium, white head with a ceep gold body. Nose is bready and maltedness comes through in the flavour. Watery though the figs are apparent. Not my favourite offering from this brewery...
Spinnakers King Tuts Tipple;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Traditional Ale - Other;Spinnakers Brewpub;This is a strange beer,it was put out as a tie in to the BC Royal Museum Egyptian exhibit. On the pour,looks like a pale ale,or a white wine,the head is long lasting tiny tan bubbles,with good lacing.The nose is elderberry and Niagara gold. On taste,hard to put a finger on it, some of the the ingredients are emmer wheat fig,and star anise.It sticks to your tongue ,and it is sweet and yet just tart,I can taste the fig and wheat, and the finish is white chocolate.I cant really wrap my tongue around this one,it is almost wine like,but very mild. It is very earthy and sort of heavy a one bottle a day experience.And very open to personal interpretation,I think most will love or hate this one...Im on the fence.
Spinnakers King Tuts Tipple;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Traditional Ale - Other;Spinnakers Brewpub;Golden color with interesting aromas, fig definitely stands out. A lot of fig/date in the taste with a light bitterness. There�s quite a bit of flavour in this beer and I didn�t find it thin.
Spinnakers King Tuts Tipple;Victoria, British Columbia, Canada;Traditional Ale - Other;Spinnakers Brewpub;"Very pale golden colour with a 1"" thick creamy head. Faint pale malt aroma with a pronounced date/fig aroma and some faint spiciness, although I wouldn�t know that it�s star anise. Honey aroma also seems to be present here. Flavour is similar but with less complexity than the aroma. Body is quite thin but the beer has a slight sour finish. An interesting brew that is quite successful."

TableRock OLearys XXX Stout;Boise, Idaho, United States;Stout - Dry;TableRock BrewPub & Grill;Starts out with great coffee and chocolate aromas and continues the same in the flavors with some added nuttiness. Just a great all around beer and a wonderful example of a Stout. I had this served once with CO2 and once with Nitrogen.

Sports City Cafe Straight from the Teats;La Jolla, California, United States;Stout;CJs Grill and Brewing;This beer was sampled at the San Diego Real Ale Festival 2004. This beer poured a dark brown color but truly had hints of magenta red in which you could see slightly through it...which sort of scared me from the start. A tiny tan head was produced but quickly dissipated. The aroma was cocoa and coffee with a slight hint of chocolate....a very typical nose, but somewhat light in the smell. The taste was very weak, watered down almost. Some hints of cardboardy chocolate and cocoa, but really nothing interesting going on at all! Almost a plastic quality to the cocoa...very thin mouthfeel, no carbonation, somewhat disappointing...it had a slight milky rancidness to it that just wouldnt go away. Thank you and next please.....

Four Peaks Old Porter;Tempe, Arizona, United States;Porter - Imperial;Four Peaks Brewing Company (AB InBev);Listed as Old Bourbon Porter @ GABF 2004 - Good solid bourbon and wood aroma, buttery, with less stout and porter characteristics than expected.

Acetic & lactic acids, artificial sweetener jumping out of the bottle, wood. Tastes like sweet deep-frying oil, alleviated by lactic acid; acetic acid not perceptible in the taste. Despite the awful sweetener, the balance between sweet-sour is near-perfect. Slick, oily, lots of restsweetness. Excellent for its style - WHICH IS LOW ALCOHOL - not for the beerlover."

The earthy hay like palate continues thru the finish along with the medium high refined dort bitterness, hangs for a while. I�ve tasted more behaved dorts but this is on this bitter side of the style.
Marzoni's Dortmunder;Duncansville, Pennsylvania, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Marzoni's Brick Oven & Brewing Co.;Horrid. That�s how I describe both this beer and my last experience at Marzoni�s. What I ordered was a Dortmunder. What I saw looked splendid: clear and sharp amber colored body with a small-bubbled, densely packed white head. What I smelled was a diacetyl bomb. What I tasted was a greasy, oily, biting buttery mess. What I asked the bartender was if he was aware that this beer is unfit for human comsumption. What I got was brushed off and charged $3.50 for a pint that went right down the sink drain. Hey, if you�re going to insist that this beer is ok to serve, then I�m going to rate it.

Has that dry paper, hay taste to it. Very authentic - not up there with Zum Uerige or Zum Schluessel, but a big surprise sitting in western PA! Dry mild acidic finish with light nutty after.

Schmitt Br�u Jura Hell;Schesslitz, Bavaria, Germany;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Schmitt Br�u;Bottle. A clear, quite pale golden body with a small white head. Grainy nose with a fruity touch. I�m usually not very fond of beers on the grainy side, but this one was sort of pleasant. The flavor is more on the fruity side, with grains still evident. Some bitterness and sweetness too. Medium to thin body, well-attenuated, with a fruity and bitter finish. A quite boring beer with too much emphasis on the grains in the aroma, but sure drinkable and quenching as the flavor is on a different level. (080912)

Reh Ellertaler Landbier Hell;Lohndorf, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Privatbrauerei Reh;"The remarkable part of this beer is in the naming. It is a Landbier and a ""Deer""-Beer and maybe also a Kellerbier or just a Helle? I would almost go into the Helle category, as this beer does not taste wise hit the note of slight bitternes you would expect in a Unfiltriertes beer. Not a beer without charm, but slightly unremarkable in taste."

Abita Farmhouse Ale;Abita Springs, Louisiana, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;Abita Brewing Company;Tap @ Blind Tiger. Real east for this beer to get lost among all of the good saisons that pass through these taps. Too bad this one didn�t get lost somewhere between Louisiana and New York. Farmhouse flavors are so mellow they seem to be fake. Way too light to be enjoyable at all. Too sweet.

Fegley's Brew Works Blastberry Wheat;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;On tap at the Bethlehem location. Poured a medium and murky/cloudy peach color with a smaller sized head. Aromas of berries, fruity, and wheat. Tastes of the same berries (a bunch of different ones) and wheatiness. I found this to be refreshing after a long day out in the sun.
Fegley's Brew Works Blastberry Wheat;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Thick body for the style. Lots of fruit on the nose-cherry and raspberry mostly.

Fegley's Brew Works Blastberry Wheat;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Deep cloudy amberish brown, creamy off-white and pinkish head. The nose on this was all about blueberry, cherry, and raspberry with a slight spicy clove and bready undertone. Flavor pratically matches, but was not overly sweet. A small bitterness helps to keep things in check and round this unique brew out. Medium bodied, soft carbonation, smooth fruity finish. A nice lawnmower brew....
Fegley's Brew Works Blastberry Wheat;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;I thought this one was pretty good....not great, but not bad. Decent complex berry smell and taste, including blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries, with a smooth, crisp finish.

Fegley's Brew Works Blastberry Wheat;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;I enjoyed this beer. All the great berrys were there. Strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry. It was a good beer overall. Fruit was minimal, but that it not a bad thing. Too sweet is bad as well. In the end, a good beer. Its more of a Hefeweizen with some fruit than anything.
Fegley's Brew Works Blastberry Wheat;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Fegley's Brew Works;Red, fizzy, almost carbonated. Sour, like a lambic. Refreshing when cold, but more like a wine cooler. Not a good example of a fruit beer done right.

Aroma is the specific wheat beer combo of banana and clove with just a hint of dark malts. Taste is a bit heavier on the dunkel part of the beer with some roasted quality and a bit of caramel. Body is medium and carbonation seems just right. Overall a decent dunkelweizen.

Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Tap at Lazy Boy. Dark orange pour. Dank, bitter aroma, cement and lychee are noted. Very bitter flavor, with depe malts and a nice full body. Exhibits the hop very well, though the hop itself is pretty boring, high in alpha and low in juiciness. Quite dry.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Clear firey orange color with lacing type head. Livey carbo. Aroma was skunky and fruity. Smelled like straight weed.Taste was the same with earthy dirt finish.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Tap. I had this after a IIPA (oops), so I think many of the subtleties were probably lost on me. Seemed like a good take on an IPA. Sly Fox has like a million of them, which I don�t think is necessary, but they better be good at making them by now. Good pithy citrus quality in this beer.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Tap at Barcade: ( I think I had a defective barrel) Light amber pour, with a dense and thick creamy tan head. Lasted long too. The aroma is horrible. It smells like artificial, perfumy berry, like scented markers or berry flavored cereal. Pine needles in there somewhere when it warms. The body has a nice texture, creamy and velvety. The flavor has no hop depth, just perfumy bitterness. Harsh pine dominates, making it seem like they only used bittering hops in the recipe. No discerning hop character, other than unappealing bitterness. Lacking balance, dissappoiting, and easily the worst of the Sly Fox IPA project, which I�ve enjoyed up until this point.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Tap at The Ginger Man. Golden colour, slightly hazy. The aroma is quite herbal and woody. Loads of resinous pine hop aroma. Some light orange/peach on the back. Flavour is quite nice. Earthy orange hop flavour over a light maltiness. Very earthy and woody and a strong resinous bitterness. Lingering heavy resin and fairly aggressive bitterness. A bit rough, but it�s pretty good.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draught at Waterfront, Bklyn. Copper/orange with a frothy off-white head. Aroma initially sweet citrus/orange/grapefruit which eventually morphed into a pine/spruce essence. Flavor like a chunk of pine bark--resiny, woody hops, with a chalky finish. Mellows after a while to a more of a snappy green bell pepper bitter flavor, but still with a resiny finish. A bit clunky, but still pretty good.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Draft at the Blind Tiger. This was a few days ago, so I don�t remember it super well. I believe the aroma was piney, with some earthy malt underneath. The flavor was mostly just bitter pine-like hops, with a somewhat dry mouthfeel. Fairly harsh bitterness, but not bad in my opinion.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;On tap at Royersford location. Pours a lightly hazy orange amber with a small bubbly/creamy off white head. Aroma of pine, toffee, earthiness, a touch of citrus, yeast, hints of caramel and nuts. Flavor was very earthy, toffee, mixed nuts, lighter hop bitterness and flavor along with the Sly Fox yeast that is present in all their single hop IPAs. I prefer the American west coast hops fory IPAs but this beer was still very solid.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;I think this was one of the worst of thier experimentals. However this doenst mean it is bad by any means. It was still an excellent IPA. I just think that target isnt the best hop for flavoring and aroma. Actually I thought the finish was a bit harsh and not very clean so I wouldnt even use this for bittering. SOmehow it came out pretty good though but it was just harsher and more muddled than thier others.
Sly Fox Target IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;On tap at Sly Fox fest. Clear orange with a nice tean head. Nice hop aroma and nice flavor. Clean tasting. Nice beer. Well balanced.

James Squire Brewhouse Golden Ale;Locations:Sydney,Melbourne., Australia;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;James Squire Brewhouse;This was the one beer that changed the way i enjoyed beer It was superb back when it was a seasonal melbourne only brew which diminished quickly when they went to megabrew but also coincided with the hop shortage of 2008 that effected Amarillo more then most other hops This will usually pour with a fairly low carb coppery color and a long lasting head thanks to the wheat that will lace to the bottom of the glass

Okanagan Spring Mild Dark;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);(Bottle) Purchased at the BCLS at Fairfield Plaza back in March 2007. Another test of the shelf-life of these OK beers. Thin, quick dissipating off-white head with a deep mahogany body. Pleasant nutty nose with backing of caramel. Flavour is surprisingly full - nice roasted tongue and mild finish. Not great but definitely one of the better Okie beers.

Brown body with a small creamy beige head that fades leaving a smattering of lacing. Odd musty caramel and malt in the aroma. Sweet malt flavour, light notes of astringent grains in the finish.

Chestnut with thin beige head. Some toffee and hop on aroma, bit of butter. Too cold again, but I am sure I will get used to it. More caramel and butter in mouth. Reminded me of a Czech cerne. Too carbonated/too cold. But has some drinkability.

Okanagan Spring Mild Dark;Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Amber-brown, modest head, low aroma of caramel.

Okanagan Spring Light (Helles);Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);341ml bottle pours a pale golden color with a small white head that leaves little lacing behind. Aroma is cereal grains and grassy and mild citrus notes. Taste is a light citrus and grassy hop bitterness with a moderate malty sweetness. A typical beer for the style and nothing special.

Okanagan Spring Light (Helles);Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Bottle from Josh, served in pint glass: Poures a clean golden hue with a small but lasting fizzy head and some lace. The aroma has notes of grassy and noble hops, crystal and biscuity malts, a hint of pear, and some buttery aspects. The taste is mostly sweet malt and grainy with just a bit of fruity background. The finish displays a lingering grassy tone and little bitterness. The feel is rather flat and watery. Drinkable but that is about it, isn�t very refreshing for the style either.

Okanagan Spring Light (Helles);Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);Light and tasty with enough crackerish malt to satisfy. This is the best BC light beer I�ve tasted although it�s also the only Helles that I can remember quaffing so I can�t compare in that department. Enough flavour to make it worthwhile and a crisp finish too.
Okanagan Spring Light (Helles);Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);One of the best Okanogan beers...this emulates a true Bavarian helles in flavor profile. Pours a slightly clouded deep gold into the stein...rocky 2 finger cap with good retention and good lacing on the glass sides. Moderately carbonated. Aroma of sweet light Munich malts over a cidery tone with hints of grassy-herbs...very nice! Up front this is all malty enjoyment..a big whack of biscuit dough hits smack in the gob then a the woody-herbal hops balance nicely in mid gulp...the finish is accented by a slight drying effect as the whole lovely gulp takes on a lemony-citrus tang....then that signature helles biscuit malt after taste. This is a very good domestic rendition and the best of the Okanogan beers IMHO ...but then, I like natural malty German lagers.
Okanagan Spring Light (Helles);Vernon, British Columbia, Canada;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Okanagan Spring Brewery (Sapporo);light malty aroma. Pours a flat yellow, not much head. Light fruity flavours. Taste like a regular macro lager. Lacks that refreshing finish of a good helles.

Nose has some sweet apple notes to it with a lot of cinnamon in there. There�s also something else, I couldn�t quite place. Taste was sweet and apply, with something else.

Buntingford No 2 Sweet Stout;Royston, Hertfordshire, England;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Buntingford Brewery;I had this a couple of days before Spiesy and I guess it wasn�t properly conditioned when I tried it. It smelt very strongly of tobacco - and I don�t mean that musky pipe smoke type of tobacco, more like old fag ends steeped in ditchwater. Curious vegetal notes. The taste was rather better, but still not great. Certainly not sweet. Must re-rate if I get he chance to try this in decent condition. Cask (gravity), Catford beer Festival.
Buntingford No 2 Sweet Stout;Royston, Hertfordshire, England;Stout - Milk / Sweet;Buntingford Brewery;Bottled bright from the Catford Beer Festival, 2004. Dark brown. Full roasted aroma and flavour. This beer was not sweet at all. Silky and well rounded in the mouth but not overly sweet. It�s aroma presented like the full deal stout but lacked the ash�y, dry rawness of a straight. After not finding it on the Buntingford website I gave the brewer a quick call to clarify the existence of the beer. Honey makes sense. The beer was smooth and succulent on the palate with strong stout flavours.

Rock Bottom Long Beach Red Rooster ESB;Long Beach, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Rock Bottom Long Beach;Cask @ Real Ale Fest Red Rooster ESB as I got a bit trigger happy, residuals from the Real Ale Fest I guess. The beer is pulled from the cask a somewhat hazy amber with a bountiful head that is semi-creamy in texture, the color a nice light tan with the resultant lace a fine covering upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, clean and pleasing, ah those ESB�s, start was sweet and nicely malted, top was moderate in feel. Finish had a personable acidity, the hops masterful and spicy, but not overly so, very dry aftertaste, a fine drinking beer.

Marin ESB;Larkspur, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Marin Brewing Company;Cask at Elysian�s SBW Firkin-Firkin throwdown (vs. Elysian The Wise). Pours mostly clear amber with a small white head. Aroma is floral and citrus hops and honey. Biscuity malts show up in the taste. Watery mouthfeel and tea-like finish. Not what I was expecting in an ESB.
Marin ESB;Larkspur, California, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Marin Brewing Company;(cask conditioned at the Larkspur Landing brewpub) Hazy orange with a small white head. Aroma was mild malt with a hint of hops. Flavor was a nice balance of hops and malt. Along with the cask conditioned mouthfeel, it was a real treat.

Wellington Conviction;Hope Valley, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Edale Brewery;Cask, at Newark Beer Festival, May 2004. Notes recovered from a recently unearthed old notebook. A straightforward, quite pale quaffing bitter. Moderately bitter, with more hops than malt. Solid but not too exciting.
Wellington Conviction;Hope Valley, Derbyshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Edale Brewery;Cask Conditioned, White Horse Hedgerley, Bucks. Gravity dispense, poured by me. A decent blond ale that just tasted a little like unfermented wort. Not really a bad thing.
Boggart Potion;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boggart Hole Clough;A Mes rate: Cask at the Wenlock. Dark copper coloured with no head. Harsh fruity aroma and some heavy buttery diacetyl, pretty rank in all honesty. Flavour is thankfully not at all as bad. Nice smoky malt in the finish but it doesn�t do enough to save it all in. Clearly far from its best. Standards are slipping a little at the Wenlock...
Boggart Potion;Manchester, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Boggart Hole Clough;Has a very interesting pump clip, which is a rough circle of wood with the beers name branded in. Very malty beer, slightly sweet, not much in the way of hops. Perfect thirst quenching summer beer, if not for a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. Potion was the winner of the night for me.
Loddon Finns Premium Stout;Dunsden, Oxfordshire, England;Stout - Dry;Loddon Brewery;Don�t know what is premium about this bland roasty and fairly watery beer with a nutty finish. I�d call it standard myself. (Cask @ Reading BF)

Vermont Pub Steinbier;Burlington, Vermont, United States;Traditional Ale - Other;Vermont Pub & Brewery;Tap at the brewpub. Medium amber-brown, hints of haziness, little head. Nose primarily smoky and herbal with a dash of caramel. Caramel, rosemary and tarragon in the flavor, a bit of vanilla near the end, dryish finish, very pleasant and full-bodied.
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Reviewed from notes. The appearance was a ruddy burnt amber close to brown in color with a finger�s worth of white foamy head that slid into the beer at a decent pace. Lace slid with the sips. The aroma had a nice soft sweet roasty nuttiness rolling all about some caramel/toffee malts. Some chocolate and then some earthiness. The flavor leaned towards the sweet side and letting the hoppiness escape into oblivion. It�s all about the malts in this one which leads into the aftertaste and finish. The feel was about medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt fine as well. Overall, I wonder how many brown ales I actually have shoved down my throat over the years. Quite interesting the more I find in this book my buddy in New York sent me. Well, I guess I�ll be uploading the rest of these soon enough.
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;on tap-pours a thin light tan head with a retaining ring that laces and mahogany color. Aroma is mild dark malt-molasses. Taste is peat/burnt like Kathy�s cooking(�I represent that remark) dark malt-molasses/chocolate, nutty, secondary earthy hops bite. Medium body. OK carbonation.
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Hazy dark chestnut. Tiny off-white cover. Original nose: toasty, spicy (cloves, nutmeg) and with a fair residual sugar content. Well roasted malts, soft nut skin and nondescript fruitiness to go along the sweetish caramelly profile. A clean a highly drinkable ale. Please don�t ask me why they had 2 brown ales on the menu at the same time. At least, they were very well done.
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;In short: Smooth and creamy standard brewpub brown ale. Pretty ok. How: Tap at brewpub december 2007 The look: Dark mahogany body with red highlights, medium tan head. In long: The slim but not watery body conceals smooth caramelized nuts. Creamy and smooth beer. A lick of vanilla. A light juicy tartness in the finish increases drinkability. Nothing special here but still a decent session Brown Ale. Marthas Ordinary Brown Ale.
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;My Bottom Line: Earthy caramel maltiness dominates the flavor profile in this lean and lightly roasty Brown Ale. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam tops the dark brown. -Red meat allusions hover atop the roasting caramel. -Nuttiness is present in the residual sugars, but tend to be engulfed by the caramel. -Some discreet fruitiness provide a little more complexity. On tap at the brewpub.
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;on cask. Poured a dark brown, with a thinhead. The aroma was chocolate and toffee. The flavor was thick and chocolaty, with a watery finish. good beer
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;"On cask at the brewpub with the Windy City Beerman? Muzzlehatch. First of all, I�m going to have to overhaul almost all of my old cask ratings after attending four days of a real cask festival. The beer should be clear, it tastes better that way. With all of the finings and yeast (some of it autolyzed perhaps) and what not, having dropped out, the flavor is not muddled. So this one wasnt ""bright"" as they say, but very muddy brown-pudding colored beer with a lasting dark beige head. Aroma is full of diacetyl and sticky toffee, some light roast/coffee notes. Flavor has an initial chocolate sweetness, but a pungent grapeskin like flavor shows up, followed by a sour yeast flavor that shouldnt be there. Gritty, muddy mouthfeel, some brown sugar on the end. This is a mess and I don�t think they should serve this one on cask if they are going to serve it in such poor condition."
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Sampled onn draught at the brewpub 5/20/2005 with The Motor City Beerman, ClarkVV. On cask. Butterscotch-almond nose, I would think diacetyl but looks like they were aiming for this sort of thing...actually reasonably pleasant if dull...lasting creamy head topping a dusky brown body...wine and caramel in the full thick mouthfeel, alas the sourness of the vine eventually overpowers leaving very little to ponder. Ehh.
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;Cask @ CT Real Ale Festival. Licorice anise aroma with hints of coffee malts. Mildly hazy mahogany color with small to none off white head. Chocolate bittered malts with hints of licorice as this guy next to me drops his tasting glass on the cement floor without it breaking amazingly. Whilst composing the last sentence, the guy at the pizza counter offers me a pad of lined paper to write my notes on. I politely decline and continue jotting on my pad of Aldara post-it notes. Did I mention that this beer was uncaptivating?
Marthas Peculiar Brown;Nashua, New Hampshire, United States;Brown Ale;Marthas Exchange Restaurant and Brewing;@ brewpub. Ok nose, nutty, carmel, chocolate, roasty. Tad hazy orangy/ dark brown color.

Medium to high bubbles for a cask beer. Tasty mild!
Craftsman Mild;Pasadena, California, United States;Mild Ale;Craftsman Brewing Company;Cask @ Real Ale Fest San Diego The beer pulls from the cask a beclouded dark amber color, the head moderate in size, frothy in texture and a light tan in color, lace adequate to cover the glass. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and clean, nice malt presence, sweet and a fair to middling top. Finish is benign in its acidity, the hops mild and pleasing to the palate, dry aftertaste, a drinkable beer.

Clear ginger aroma, mild honey aroma. Flavour is mellow sweet with a nice blend between honey and ginger. Finish soft ginger spiced.
Cambridge Honey-Ginger Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cambridge Brewing Company;Summer 2005 draught. Deep goldenrod yellow with some light tangerine juice suggestions. Chill haze. Head is fully dissipating, ginger seems to do that, with a bit of white foam clinging to the edges. No lacing on my glass. Aroma of candyish ginger, warm honey tones. Flavor tastes like honey and ginger, quite surprisingly. Hmm, it�s got a medium-light body, but the malt is definitely there, you taste the honey flavor of the pilsener malt more than you taste the honey flavor from the actual honey. I guess all the honey ferments out though. Motelpogo says boring, but what do you expect from a honey ginger. This is well-done, crisp and refreshing as promised and not thin and watery like many other summer beers. The ginger is not overdone either, which is nice for a change. Aireated texture, rather dry on the end, with quite a bit of carbonation.
Cambridge Honey-Ginger Ale;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Flavored - Other;Cambridge Brewing Company;no surprises in the aroma, ginger sweets. pleasant hint of sharpness but quite thin and got boring very quickly

Nethergate Something Else;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask at the Wenlock Arms (with Spiesy). The colour was a pale amber/gold, butt I thought this tended towards the session bitter style, more than a golden ale. The aroma had some soft malt and the palate started out subdued and a little sweet with the hop bitterness coming through at the end. However, the hops wern�t too well developed and, for some reason I can�t quite put my finger on, the whole thing didn�t come together too well and I found myself not enjoying this too mucg by the end of the pint. Average.
Nethergate Something Else;Long Melford, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Nethergate Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Golden bright in wonderful condition dressed with a white speckled head. Bitter flavour with a stagnant pound water after taste.
Cottage You Cannot Be Serious;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;The Good Intent, Rochester. Mad night - the Morris Dancers were practising hitting each other with staves in the back room, while the front room was pounding with Cher on the juke box. I was introduced to three new drinking buddies, one of whom was so keen to impress he was bouncing off the walls with enthusiasm, while another was feeding the juke box with more Cher songs. Meanwhile the beer was fairly crap - greasy nonsense with a hint of flowery citric, but nothing obvious. A nothing sort of beer. You cannot be serious!

Cottage You Cannot Be Serious;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;A Mes rate: Cask at Fringe. Pale amber with a thin white head. Malt and tea in an aroma that is bland and not great. The flavour is an odd combination of lemon and malt that doesn�t work too well. Sweet malty finish with a bitterness that seems to come out of no where and have very little to do with hops. Erm.. yeah... Next?
Cottage You Cannot Be Serious;Castle Cary, Somerset, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Cottage Brewing;Cask@The Head of Steam, Euston. Funny name, McEnroe would be proud. Stale flavour however, some raisin toast and stale hops, not very interesting, McEnroe wouldn�t be so proud of the beer.

Breconshire Discovery;Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Breconshire Brewery;Cow & Plough Beer Festival. Bronze and red in colour with a small head. Aromas are fruity and vineous with blackcurrent and spices. Flavours are fruity, juicy malts followed by a fair degree of dryness. A little thin on the palate but therefore easier to glug!
Breconshire Discovery;Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Breconshire Brewery;Cask (handpump), at the Wenlock Arms (with Spiesy). As Spiesy says, this drinks like a session bitter, albeit a slightly malty one, and does not really shine in any department. The malt comes over a bit raw and undeveloped. A reasonable, but not very refined, bitter.
Breconshire Discovery;Brecon, Powys, Wales;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Breconshire Brewery;Cask Conditioned, at the Wenlock Arms, London. Light amber colour with a fine white head. Easy drinking bitter that is probably stronger than it needs to be. Given its strength I�d say this beer is punching beneath its weight.

Hardys & Hansons Vintage 1832;Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Hardys & Hansons;Cask, at Newark Beer Festival, May 2004. Notes recovered from a recently unearthed old notebook. Rather dark for a bitter - chestnut, with a reddish tinge. Very fruity aroma, almost volatile and estery - sort of like pear drops (but not in a bad way). Some roast malt in the flavour with a fair ration of tangy, slightly citric, hops. Medium bodied, smooth and very slightly sweet. An interesting and tasty beer. Seasonal and monthly beers from Regionals can be a little dull and uninspired but that is not the case here.

Bitter End Hammerhead Porter;Austin, Texas, United States;Porter;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;A nice beer. Smoky flavor, not the maltiest beer out there but it is up front in the beginning and finishes slightly bitter. Not the best porter out there, but definitely worth repeating.

The aroma is roasty, sweet, malty, and a bit of coffee. The flavor is very clean with roast, smoke, & some sweetness. This is a very drinkable beer given what I assume to be the alcohol content (7 to 8%?). I love the coffee, roast, and smoke characteristics. Excellent beer!

Bitter End Intimidator Doppel Schwarz;Austin, Texas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"Tap. Grat, dude! We must have both been at B-Sides last night. I was even wearing the same outfit as in my new picture. Well, what can I say about this beer? It�s the last beer created here by longtime BE brewmaster, Texas brewing legend, and all-around good guy, Tim Schwarz. Hahaha, get it? inTIMidator dopple SCHWARZ. Clever name. Actually, their hottie cocktail girl Kirsten told me that it�s a dopplebock, so the style here is a little ambiguous. It pours a dark, opaque brown and is madly malty and complex, with a hint of effervescence and of course the standard BE malts. Some vague hints of fruit: banana, peaches in the midst of chocolate-coffee-caramel dark malts. Very gentle mouthfeel; something tells me that this has a much higher ABV than it tastes like. A truly great creation."
Bitter End Intimidator Doppel Schwarz;Austin, Texas, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Technically This is doppel schwarz. Amazing. Mouthwatering goodness. Pours a very black dark with a nice tan head. Brew smells like a really great lager yeast, a chocolate dark roasted malt. Also has that german malt spiciness so characteristic of this style. Tastes of baked apples, roasted raspberries, and fresh roasted malt. All of this fades out to a very nice wet yeast aftertaste.Great brew. grat

Slight haze to the light golden body, on top a white head. Floral aroma and flavours, strange softness to the palate, could not get my head around the smooth body or the actual taste, which I found too wishy-washy.

Aroma has lots of farm poop muddling it. Aromas are overpoweringly poopy. Smokey too. Quite interesting, actually. Has resinous hops and the suggestion of peat, even. Has an unclean, boggy aroma and flavor--nitrates? I�ll give it the benefit of the doubt but I have no idea if it is supposed to taste this way or if the beer just isn�t in great condition. Not sure I like it either way.

Nikko Beer;Nikko, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nikko Brewing;Short head, normal color with a golden touch. I find both the aroma and taste to be of perfect average level. They said its a pilsner, even though it doesnt say anywhere on the pack. It really doesnt taste like any other pilsners Ive had though. Anyway, its slightly better than most mass-produced beers in that it has a certain refreshing, citrus-like flavor, but still does not make above average. Stila good drink that I would choose above most other beers on the supermarket shelves in Japan.
Nikko Beer;Nikko, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nikko Brewing;"Bottle, 6 months past its ""drink by"" date. Big, meaty malt character. Low hops, but rich grainy malt and honey that seem to have been accentuated by time passing. Almost no hops, but I see here that it probably had few to begin with. Just a touch of grassy citrus in there somewhere. Tasty enough."
Nikko Beer;Nikko, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nikko Brewing;"Bottled (BB 07/2009). Golden color, small white head. Skunky hops, light citrusy perfume and apple in the nose. Sweetish corn malts, same perfumic citrus than in the nose and Saaz(?) hops in the flavor. Fresh bottle would probably be quite ok pale lager, this a bit old one was slightly ""too exotic""."
Nikko Beer;Nikko, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nikko Brewing;Bottled (thanks omhper!). Golden colour, mediumsized white head which vanishes quite quickly. Aroma is grainy, a bit grassy and strange skunky notes. Also some ricelike sweetness. Flavour is quite much the same.
Nikko Beer;Nikko, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nikko Brewing;"My Bottom Line: Toasted malts all the way once again for this Nikko lager, but unlike their Amber, this one is subdued and storyless, trying too much to emulate the green-bottled macros. Further Personal Perceptions: -A veil of foam straddles the straw blond transparency. -The soft carbonation and decent maltiness create a sufficiently pleasant mouthfeel. -The total lack of hoppiness is disappointing. -This is still clean and well-brewed, just not for the pleasure-seeking crowd. Bottle; thx Tim!"
Nikko Beer;Nikko, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nikko Brewing;Golden color. Big frothy white head. Cornmeal, toasted malts, sour nose. Mainstream corn beer with little body. No thanks again.
Nikko Beer;Nikko, Japan;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Nikko Brewing;I rated this beer in comparison to other Japanese beers (thats all I�ve had for the past while). It had a very wide range of flavors, while still maintaining the simple, crispness that most beers of Japan have. It was also fairly hoppy, which was quite a surprise.

Valley Brew Decadence 8;Stockton, California, United States;Dubbel;Valley Brewing Company;In a word, RICH as a good dubbel ought to be. Tough to find this beauty down in Socal but picked some up at City Beer Store in San Francisco. Dark fruit notes from sniff to swallow complemented by a soothing alcoholic warmth. Tremendous local version of an age old style.
Valley Brew Decadence 8;Stockton, California, United States;Dubbel;Valley Brewing Company;Bomber from the Co-Op in Davis, CA. Pours very dark brown with a foamy 3 finger beige head. Warm dark malt aromas. Near full bodied. Flavor evinces a touch of heat, but mostly a lot of malt, dark, and I think there�s a lingering note of kandi. Very lightly spicey. I�d suggest it�s not undeserving of consideration as an abbey ale. It�s certainly very good, though perhaps a bit light on spice. There�s just a little. Yummy.

G�ller Drosendorf Pilsener;Drosendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei G�ller Drosendorf;Bottle, bought at the brewery. Label says brewed by G�ller in Zeil am Main. Is this tiny brewery with the big beer garden still brewing? Does it only brew a bit of tap beer for its own premises (see rating Ohmper)? Malty aroma, with peach and a hint of boiled milk. Malty flavor: clearly hopbitter with hay and vanilla. Rather thin, especially for a Franconian pilsener. Hopbitter and hay aftertaste.
Bubes Scotch Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bubes Brewery;I really enjoyed this beer. It has a nice color (what I could see I was in the Catacombs) and an excellent malty, sweet aroma. The beer goes down on the sweet/malty side with a nice fruitiness. There is little to no hoppiness. Drank this beer as part of the sampler and got a growler fill of it to go.
Bubes Scotch Ale;Mt. Joy, Pennsylvania, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bubes Brewery;A good scotch ale - nice dark brown color - thin head with light lacing. Fairly robust malts with a hint of smokiness. Slightly grainy with a hint of hops at the finish.
Barley's Anastasia Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;Very good. A little sweet, so you can�t drink too many. Chocolate and some roasted malt flavor. Medium mouth feel.
Barley's Anastasia Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;6/28/04: Barley�s Growler. Malty and sour aroma. Black-brown body with a light tan, creamy head. Some slight lacing. Very creamy flavor with a lovely malty taste. Flavor is sugary and sweet with a medium sized bitter hop finish. A very strong brew, which made me feel very content! Congrats to Jay on a great brew!
Barley's Anastasia Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;"At the pub, 7/10/04, on the way home from Colorado. This started off nice - looks beautiful - shiny black/brown - tilt the glass and you�ll see blood red around the edges, darker tan head, great lacing. Smells malty, roasty, sweet vanilla and hoppy. Palate is thick and viscous (and later, cloying). A ton of flavors - chocolate, cream, espresso, plum, licorice; sourness and some hops at the end. This all sounds good, but the sweetness kept building up, and combined with the slight sourness and lack of stronger hops, this just got to be too cloying (syrupy sweet tasting) - I could barely finish it."
Barley's Anastasia Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;Dark brown with a small tan head. Roasted malt aroma. Flavor is very sweet with roasted malt and dark chocolate. Really drinkable and good.
Barley's Anastasia Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;On tap at Barley�s #1. Poured deep red-brown, surprisingly translucent, with a light tan head. I detected molasses, vanilla, and coffee in the aroma. The flavor started with a fruit explosion reminiscent of Thirsty Dog�s Imperial, which led to molasses, vanilla, burnt roasted malt, and a bit of caramel. The downside to this beer is its relatively short flavor profile and way-too-thin body that led to a rather lifeless salty/leathery finish. A very sweet example of the style.
Barley's Anastasia Russian Imperial Stout;Columbus, Ohio, United States;Stout - Imperial;Barley's Brewing Company;"Unfortunately I missed the unveiling of this beer at the Afternoon with the Brewers, but at least I got to try it later. I was looking forward to this beer because I think Barley�s version of an Imperial Stout falls a little short (probably mostly due to the fact that the recipe pre-dates the law that allowed for higher-ABV beers). It is indeed better than Alexander�s but not a whole lot. The beer is an inky black with a miniscule off-white head and very little lacing. I had to bury my nose pretty deep in the glass to get the aroma but it is there: Roasted malt, coffee and hops. The body is rich and somewhat sticky, with a strong roasted malt character. Bitter coffee and chocolate are also apparent. The finish is high on the hops, being a little more bitter than most Imperial Stouts (not as much as Great Divide Maverick though). Overall this is a pretty good offering to the category, and it is always nice to try a homebrew that has ""graduated"" to being brewed for local beer lovers like myself."

Short review with Teresa. Pale yellow, still, clear with no head. Aroma is airy, pale wood. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is dry and musty yet quenching apple, dry white wine and Lambrini notes, subtle elderflower and fruit infusion, gooseberry. Not loads of flavour but I guess it hit the spot after lots of walking around, as I enjoyed it quite a lot. (7-3-7-4-15=3.6)

Pyramid Belgian Tripel;Seattle, Washington, United States;Tripel;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Very pale, almost colourless beer with a thin white head. Candi sugar, apple, and some lemon are present. Flavour is similar, but very thin bodied and a huge amount of ethanol taste completely ruin the balance. Not enough malt and way too much sugar. I�d skip this one.

Nice roasted malt flavour, with some chocolate and a decent bitterness. Some faint fruit (cherry/strawberry) also comes into play along with a lactic sourness. Some alcohol sneaks in here, but still a nicely crafted brew.
Pyramid Rain City Nitro Stout;Seattle, Washington, United States;Stout - Dry;Pyramid Breweries (Cervecer�a Costa Rica - FIFCO);Tap@Pyramid Alehouse. Surprising given that their other beers were a bit below par, but it may have been because i had it after their awful tripel. Surprisingly dry, some nice toasty/roasty malt, not bad, decent length i suppose, drinkable, if a little uninteresting.
Sir Walter Raleigh Lager;Apex, North Carolina, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Apex Brewing Company;Draft at Carolina Ale House.

Dark orange color. Nice solid white head. Smells obviously very orangey. Orange zest, cloves, wet hay. Taste is excellently spicy. The orange zest really comes through and the honey balances this out for a great sweetness and spiciness that was very tasty. Good brew

Zuma Cancun;Atlanta, Georgia, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Zuma Brewery;"Better than I had anticipated but still rather mainstream. The commercial desription says ""slightly hoppy finish"" and I would highlight the word SLIGHTLY. The beer is refreshing but lacks body and flavor. A good afternoon by the pool beer."

Deschutes Twilight Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;Crisp as can be...not a light blonde type - more of a zesty pale ale. Clean mouthfeel. More flavor than many a 5% abv session type brew. Glad Deschutes included it in their 2019 summer offerings.

Deschutes Twilight Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 6/20/2018. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy deep golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Thick soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of lemon, orange, grapefruit, peach, pear, red apple, honey, wheat, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness.

Lingering notes of lemon, orange, grapefruit, peach, pear, red apple, honey, wheat, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and moderate fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a delicious American blonde ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the milfly bitter/drying finish. Great balance of citrus/earthy hops, pale/Munich malts, and restrained fruity English house yeast complexity. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected of the brewery."

Deschutes Twilight Ale;Bend, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Deschutes Brewery;off the bat this reminds me of older style sierra nevada pale-aroma has earthy, piney hops, some malt. flavor has some pine and citrus rind but thats about it for the hops, a bit medicinal, medium bitterness, but also has a nice smooth malt presence and yeast flavor, like i recall sierra nevada pale having before the malts tasted like husks and corn syrup. old school APA fans would probably like this

Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Barley Island Brewing;Not sure what anyone else could ask of this beer. It fits the style to a T and is just magnificent. If you�re into wheat beers, this is a real keeper!!

Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Barley Island Brewing;bottle - Pours gold and very bubbly with a huge white head. The aroma is lacking. I�m just getting some mild grain. The flavor is moderately sweet with some fruit character. Overcarbonated. It�s light bodied and fairly good for what it is, a simple summer beer.
Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Barley Island Brewing;12 ounce bottle in JW Marriot bar Indy. Coriander and wit flavors against the hazy orange citrus body and taste. Ok.
Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Barley Island Brewing;"Draft to taster. Looks solid; an almost completely transparent light gold with white lacing. Smells of Belgian yeast and spices. Tastes like it smells, only more robust, with a nice, light mouthfeel. This one exceeded my expectations, as I�m not a huge fan of the style to begin with."
Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Barley Island Brewing;"Aroma: Lightly tart wheat with some coriander; comes off as floral and peppery as well- lots of character for the style. Appearance: Cloudy yellow/gold body with a collar of bubbly white head. Flavor: Tart, spiced wheat character up front with a bit of honey toward the finish; the spice lingers, but dissipates from the start. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, long finish. Overall: A very nice Witbier; definitely recommended for fans of the style."
Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Barley Island Brewing;Bottle. Pours a rather hazy golden color with a moderate white head on it. Nose has a decent amount of wheat in there with a moderate amount of coriander and spice. Taste has a little bit of citrus to it, but with a sweet finish to it that was unexpected. OK.
Barley Island Sheet Metal Blonde;Noblesville, Indiana, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Barley Island Brewing;"Pours with a huge head that disappears quickly. As for the taste, it reminds me of a heavier miller lite; not much flavor upfront, with a really shitty aftertaste. No thanks."
Deschutes Spindrift Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout;Deschutes Brewery;Poured with little head, not much aroma. I was expecting more flavor and a thicker body. It�s a very mild stout. Not very sweet. A roasted bitter aftertaste.
Deschutes Spindrift Stout;Bend, Oregon, United States;Stout;Deschutes Brewery;rediculously light for a stout, thin off white head. Creamy vanilla and some light chocolate among the roasted but not burnt nose. More like a real roaste3y brown ale than a stout to me. hop bitters dry out well on the palate.
Free State Wit Lightning;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Fairly light, not syrupy at all. I thought it was on the drier end of the sweet>>>dry scale. Loved the slightly herbal banana and pear esters in aroma. Fruity coriander and mostly leafy body. Grain and Jonathan apple in finish. What really made this beer for me was how it was restrained --FS loves to hop beers to death and I didn�t taste any of the house hop character. I�m also used to FS beers all having dull aromatic qualities -- noted the dry hopping and enjoyed it.
Free State Wit Lightning;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;Draft: Opaque pear. Thin layer of tight white bubbles with a creamy edge. Aroma of leafy hops, chalky yeast, and coriander. Fairly herbal with hints of clove, apple, and freshly cracked pale malts. Very soft body. Tight, restrained carbonation. Amplified malt flavors yield to juicy noble hops and body-softening flower petals. Low acidity is driven away by the sweet toasted malt backbone. Spicy fennel and a juicy, melony Styrian Golding-like presence reduce the sweetness as the ever slight notes of coriander spring into action. Candy sugar dominates the finish amid lesser notes of candied white grapes, honey-drizzled melon, mint leaves, and firm phenols. Glazed malt, coriander, white grapes, and rose hips linger. If they lessened the sweetness, doubled the hops, and added some dryness, this would be unbeatable.
Free State Wit Lightning;Lawrence, Kansas, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Free State Brewing Company;"Sweet, lightly flowery, perfumey and honeyish aroma, with plenty of juicy lemon, doughy yeast, faint banana, orange peel, coriander and other spices, very full and largely sugary. Pale golden color with a slight rosy cast, hazy, with a fine, creamy head and artful lacing. Flavor begins with a hit of malty sweetness, becoming fruity, lightly tangy and spicy with a hugely refreshing, yeasty and lightly bittering finish, some lingering spicy, leafy hop flavors as well. Medium bodied, substantially ""wet"" palate, lush and smooth. An interesting and tasty beer, actually my first foray into ""Double Wits"". (Should have been called 'Lightning Wit', though, I think...)"

Medium bodied, soft carb, creamy mouthfeel, light sweet finish
Milk Street Zig Zag;Frome, Somerset, England;Stout;Frome Brewing Co. (prev Milk Street Brewery);I found this to be more sour than bitter, with the citrus flavour pushing itself to the front with every sip.. The sourness seemed to overpower the other flavours and remained with the long finish so I didn't really enjoy this. I'm sure many will agree but I don't think hoppy citrus stouts work at all and I avoid them if I can.
Milk Street Zig Zag;Frome, Somerset, England;Stout;Frome Brewing Co. (prev Milk Street Brewery);Packs a decent amount of flavour un gor the abv. Liquorice milk chocolate could mistake this for a sweet stout.

Rich and dark aroma has m�mmi, malt, salt licorice, barbeque (hickory smoke, chili, paprika, grilled meat, ...). Nice palate, balanced and good thickness, 5/5. Taste starts with just a bit of initial bitterness on the tip of the tongue. Evolves to malty and barbequey body. Hints of chili (no burn, just the taste) on the sides. Some faint salt licorice in body as well as back of throat. ""Edged"" (i.e. it has no body) burnt tastes felt on top of it. Slightly dry finish leaves a long after taste of burnt and ammonia. Quite good and no faulty tastes."

Black Isle Hibernator;Munlochy, Ross & Cromarty, Scotland;Stout;Black Isle Brewing;"Quite sweet! When I tried it, it�s style was unclear, and I wrote in my notes, ""good porter...or a good stout"".

Full Sail Sunspot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Another nice run of the mill IPA from FS. Medium bodied, medium flavored, medium in the hop department, this one definitely can do ya well on a hot day, but overall is fairly square.

Full Sail Sunspot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;this 22 oz bottle was poured into a standard pint glass. The color wasa dar, dakr orange and was very cloudy. The head was white and creamy looking. The smell was very faint and made me think that since this was a 2006 the hops must have faded. When I tasted it the hops had indeed faded. I got a very malty, grainy taste from this one. I am pretty sure it was past its prime. I�d love to try a fresh one as their Wreck The Halls IPA is delicious.

Full Sail Sunspot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;A dark hazy amber ale with an extra thick frothy off white head. Aroma of citrusy caramel, and definite profound floral c-hops. In mouth, a classy full bodied IPA with lots of citrus and floral hops. A great IPA. Tasted in August 2007.
Full Sail Sunspot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Slightly disappointed with this, FS usually turns out some pretty expertly hopped IPAs but this was nothing to write home about. Citrusy grapefruit aroma, with a aggressively overcarbonated mouthfeel, leaving a slightly chalky aftertaste, and somewhat less than substantial malt background. Leaves me wanting something better.
Full Sail Sunspot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours copper with thick head. Hoppy aroma. Nice sweet flavour with nice mouthfeel, good IPA

Full Sail Sunspot IPA;Hood River, Oregon, United States;IPA;Full Sail Brewing Company;From a 22 oz bottle this poured a clear copper to orange with a fat off-white head that left moderate lacing. Nose of citrus hops and light malt. Lively mouthfeel, and flavor is lightly sweet and caramel malts with the grapefruit hops leading to a dry and somewhat bitter finish. A very nice IPA, which would benefit from just a little more hops.

Pike Amber Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;not a fan of this one. rather weak and muddled. nothing REALLY off but nothing to redeem.
Pike Amber Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;this brew was a little different then I expected but looked cloudy and colorful.
Pike Amber Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;(Draught) Sampled at the brewpub on October 17, 2007. Pours a clear, amber body and a frothy white heaad. Nose of citrus and coriander. Flavour is average bitterness with a good spiced finish. Somewhat thin compared to the other heavy English malted beers. Good.
Pike Amber Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Mediocre hef. Clean aroma but not mch flavor. Darker in color than expected. A bit of citrus in the flavor.
Pike Amber Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;Hazy copper-amber colour. Hugely estery and herbal aroma - kaffir lime leaf, coriander, lemon balm. The flavour is none of the above - a bland, surprisingly clean amber with an almost cinnamony finish.
Pike Amber Weisse;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Pike Brewing Company;"On Tap at Pike Pub: An odd style, handed to me as a ""Weiss"" yet Amber in color, hazy with a small white head. A very light scent of citrus. A weak flavor, soda water with a lemon spritz. Rather bland."

Multi-Brasses Blanche de Kingsey;Tingwick, Quebec, Canada;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Multi-Brasses;341ml bottle poured in a weizen glass around 4 degrees. Pours a cloudy dark straw robe showing a good amount of macro carbonation. The head is white, thin and porous. Retention is minimal and lacing is pretty much inexistant. The nose is herbal and spicy with strong notes of coriander, basil and orange zest. The yeasts are very present in the nose with an earthy, leafy backbone. On the tongue, the yeasts dominate right from the start with tingling cilantro and basil followed by an acidic/soapy orange zest lingering all the way to the end. The hops are quite subtle, which is a good thing for another strong grassy or herbal element would throw the beer way off balance. Overall it�s a decent Witbier, not the best I had, but still a decent pour on a hot summer day. Pair it with white fish.
Archers Golden Goal;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Light gold in colour. Aromas are very hoppy, floral and fresh with some zest and spice. Flavours are sweet and malty but with the emphasis on floral, buttery hops. England had lost the day before I had this.
Archers Golden Goal;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask Conditioned at The Cottage, Ashorne, Warks. Pale amber with smooth bubbly head. Refreshing lemony fruity light beer with plenty of condition. Despite it being brewed for the Euro �04 tournament it would make a pleasant summer beer anyway.

Meantime Strawberry;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Interesting stab at a sourish fruit beer. Room temp in Liefmans tulip. Off-white diminishing head, fair lacing, cloudy orange/pink with wee yeast lumps. Aroma lightly yeast/citrus/distant strawberry/dry white wine. Fairly light bodied, mildly sour fruit taste, miles better than the crappier syrupy sweet fruit �lambics�, nogt a patch on the trad ones.
Meantime Strawberry;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);pours with a cloudy ornage hue and a good head, light strawberry aroma, fresh and mild strawberry flavour, moderate carbonation, a refreshing summer beer.
Meantime Strawberry;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);"Bottled. Strange murky orange body with little head. Very tame taste of watery starwberry juice; given that it could have been an overpowering fruity gloop the subtle approach isn�t too off-putting. Not as rounded as their raspberry beer."
Meantime Strawberry;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottle from Sainsburys. For me, this beer was a waste of time, was hoping for something interesting, what i got was something that was virtually tastless, some slight strawberry flavours. Lagery otherwise, bland, with an acrid homebrewy sort of sourness.
Meantime Strawberry;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottle, from Sainsbury�s. Very delicate. I selected this to accompany strawberries and cream. It worked. But there�s not a lot happening here. A slight fresh and delicate acidity is about all I can get out of it.
Meantime Strawberry;Greenwich, Greater London, England;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Meantime Brewing (Asahi);Bottled. A cloudy orangey-pink coloured beer with a faint fruity aroma. There are some strawberries in the taste but these are on the sour side rather than sweet. Wouldn�t drink this again and suprised to see the recommendation to have with cheese.

La Sedane Ambr�e;Warcq, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie d'Arthur;"Amber ale from a new �beer company� brewing at Millevertus, apparently. Bottle from Willems. Opening it over the sink proved to be the right decision: heavy gusher, beer streamed out of the bottle upon opening. What I am left with, is a coppery amber coloured beer with a thick fog of yeast bits clouding the entire robe; head is pale yellowish white, lacing, with a dense, creamy texture. Aroma strongly dominated by damp forest floor, otherwise hints of dry hay, hazelnut, soggy bread, earthy turnips, old dried thyme, tea leaves, peanuts, jute, dried orange peel, some faint �old painted furniture�-like phenols and vague H2S (rotting egg) - clearly (re)fermentation went wrong here. Taste kicks off with dried banana, some redcurrant, red apple peel, medium strong carbo, deep sourish hint even to the point where I am beginning to suspect light bacterial infection, further strengthened by a vague lactic acidity further onwards in the palate. Underneath lies a deeply toasted and nutty, bittersweet malt character. Finishes in lingering malts and heavy �dirty� baker�s yeast along with the - subtle but omnipresent - deep sourishness, remaining esters and earthy, leafy, �dull� hop bitterness enhancing the toasted character of the malts; a very (overly) bready yeastiness remains. The overall impression is clearly, and I hate to use this word, �dirty�: this is a mediocre idea badly executed. Sorry, but I do not see the point in this beer at all. I have had worse Wallonian �ambr�es� than this, in the sense of being even more badly infected, but this is far from enjoyable in this form, I�m afraid."
La Sedane Ambr�e;Warcq, France;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Brasserie d'Arthur;Bottled. Amber colour, medium beige head. Aroma is grains, nettle, berries and some herbal notes. Flavour is grains, fruits, yeast, herbs and some mild rubbery notes.

Iceni Desert Rats;Elveden, Suffolk, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Iceni Brewery;Cask Conditioned, White Horse, Hedgerley. Gravity dispense (poured by me). Golden, very light ale, I am assuming it is not a lager, as it was not marked as such (other Iceni lagers are). Thirst quenching and refreshing, but with a slightly sharp edge that many didn�t take to.
Weltons Old Cocky;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Cask handpull at The Crosse Keys Bishopsgate as �Weltons Old Cocky�, 4.3%. Golden orange, clear and still, scummy beige head leaves full lacing. Aroma is airy, carpet, resin, gluey. Body is fairly light, soft to tingly carbonation. Taste is bready, watery and quite thin. Insipid sugary and soapy vibes. Drinkable in the way water is drinkable, but not overly enjoyable. It�s absolutely fine with no bad flavours. Just very simple and insipid. From the flavour profile to the name, this is one old school beer.
Weltons Old Cocky;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;"Cask at the Tilly Shilling (JDW), Farnborough. Amber with a tight cream head; fruity aroma; sour fruit taste with a grainy body; and a sweet barley sugar finish with traces of Belgian-style spice. Interesting with a satisfying finish."

Weltons Old Cocky;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Sampled this bitter at Gabriels, Paisley in August 1999. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear straw coloured with a foamy white head. Tart lemon aroma with a thin mouthfeel. Pale malt complexes give slight digestive biscuit flavour combined with citric lemon and grapefruit notes. Citric notes and metallic hop resin aftertaste linger well into the drying finish. Finish is tart and astringent with citrus pith present. An ok session bitter.
Weltons Old Cocky;Horsham, West Sussex, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Weltons Beer;Somewhat sharp fruitiness initially but seemed to disappear through the pint. Fairly nondescript bitter with lots of grassy hops.

Leyden Referee;Bury, Greater Manchester, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Leyden;Cask Conditioned, White Horse, Hedgerley. Gravity dispense (pured by me).

Alley Kat Alligator Blackened Lager;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Finally an Alley Kat specialty brew worth drinking. The beer was a dark amber almost black but with no head to speak of, I did the bottle upside down one foot above the glass pour but couldn�t get any head. Smelt very sweet of caramel malts or maybe roasted almonds can�t quit tell. Feels very smooth and flat almost no carbonation but not to light. The taste is very grainy at the tip of the tung and turns to a sour red wine towards the back, very dry. Has a bread like after taste, not a bad beer don�t think I�ll buy t again but if someone offers me a free one I won�t stab them in the liver.
Alley Kat Alligator Blackened Lager;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Why does this beer have a grey quality to it? Absolutely zero head. Looks like a 10 year old bottle of rootbeer that has actually settled. Kinda flat and murky too and greyish. A wonderful oilslick has replaced what could�ve been a foamy top. Sour-sweet stink. Disgusting sour taste and a little bitter - quite harsh and almost upsets the stomach. Perplexing sticky mouthfeel that numbed (thank god). Feels very flat. Beer has no more and no less than 2 flavors. Yuck. Burp was ok. Very low quality in every way. My wife drew a triple coiler next to my review - now that�s a sign!!
Alley Kat Alligator Blackened Lager;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmav�;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"Not my favorite Alley Kat beer, but hey they can�t all be your favourites. Thanks to Neal for hosting a fun night for those of us who came up from Calgary. The Alligator is very dark but that is colouring and not malt as the body is not any thicker. A fairly average light malt flavour and I quickly moved back to the cask Full Moon. Reminded me more of a ""blackened"" pale lager for the colour rather than a Dunkel by taste."

Somewhat average.

Tentation de la Semois Brune;Bouillon, Belgium;Dubbel;Brasserie de Bouillon;This was one of my favorites from this brewery but that still isnt saying too much. Nice deep hazy yeasty particle color with a moderate head and some lace- similar look as rochefort but this one is more clear and a lesser body. Chocolate and nutty malt flavor along with yeast and spice. Pretty solid finish and you cant really taste the alc until the end.

Deep red-brown, hazy, with off-white lacing head. Medium body with soft medium carbonation - goes down smooth. Starts with light sweetness and malts, medium acidity, and no bitterness. The label says 8.5%, but I don�t think that�s right. I think that the Brune is actually the Ambr�e, which is actually a blonde. Certainly can�t taste 8.5%, let�s put it that way. Light nutty finish, bit sweet, with sweet-dry after. Pleasant. I may have to seek out another set of these Tentation de la Semois series, in case the labels are wrong.

Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;"First tried in 2013/Oktoberfest; really turned me on to scotch ales: Served in a thin tulip glass; murky brown with creamy head. Bourbon and oak notes in both taste and smell, with a slight vanilla aftertaste."
Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;Aroma is earthy, some caramel, nuts and malt. The appearance is an attractive dark red/brown, tan head. The flavor is an improvement over the aroma, caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, malty, some earth, some wood. The flavor improves as it warms. The finish has a light but lingering resin, and nobel hop bittering. Slight alcohol is observed on the finish only after the beer warms. The mouthfeel is medium body, little on the thick side. Fairly decent scotch ale.
Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;Growler filled at the brewpub and consumed the next day. Pours a slightly hazed deep brown with a moderate tan head that lasted through the first quarter of the glass and left bits of lace. Mild aroma of malt, lightly sweet, with not much else. The flavor is again malty with a touch of sweetness. Thin, watery body. Weak finish. Some alcohol flavor emerges as the beer warms, particularly towards the finish. As a scotch ale, this beer falls flat on its face. It lacks the earthiness and body that I typically associate with the style. As a beer in general, its really not a bad beer, and is very drinkable. Its just not a scotch ale.
Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;Deep brown beer with a thin dark head. Aroma is lightly malty. A touch of caramel and toast, but generally quite light in the aroma department. Soft brown sugar and earthy sweetness. Lingering caramelly sweetness, but I just can�t get over how light this seemed. Meh.
Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;When I was there recently, they marked it at 8.4% ABV, I don�t know if that is new or not. Pours dark black with an off-white head. Aroma is pretty thin but is faintly of caramel. Flavor is slightly roasted malt with a strong note of brown sugar. Like most things at Black Forest, I feel that it was simply served too cold. Many of the flavors really came out as the beer warmed. Re-Rate: Not much has changed in 2 years. ABV was listed at 8.2 (as opposed to 8.4 mentioned before and 7.5 in the description)
Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap @ Black Forest: Poured a hazy brown color and no head.

Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at brewpub. A brown pour, with an orange hue at the edges. The aroma was a bit earthy, wood notes, with some caramel sweet hints. The body was chewy maltyness. I like peat/ or earthy notes in the flavor of Scotch Ales as well, but this one did well with the cleaner, sweet malt profile. Nice nutty flavors, roasted caramel malt. Reminiscent of buttered toast, with a light roasty warming finish. Tasty stuff.
Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;Tap at brewpub, poured into pint glass. Color is dark, dark amber with reddish tints. Poured with a strong, heavy full head. Aroma is strong candied sweet maltiness with just a hint of sweet smoke. Taste is pour Scottish-malt sweet with candied granny smith apples. The sweetness is finely offset by a light aftertaste and a medium-light body. Well balanced of sweet versus light. Low bitterness and very quaffable.
Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;I�m still behind on my brewtopia ratings...reading off a scribbled notepad...I quite liked this scotch ale: distinct presence of sugar and heather, but maybe a little bit too sweet after awhile. Plant-like flavors and seems organic. I don�t remember being struck by the alcohol content, but I didn�t have this beer at the beginning of the night either.
Black Forest Scotch Ale;Farmingdale, New York, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Black Forest Brew Haus;Drank this quite a bit at the brewery trying to get a handle on it. 8.5% and you can taste it. No peat taste which is why I drink a Scotch Ale. Mostly a strong APA.

Sun Valley Roundhouse IPA;Hailey, Idaho, United States;IPA;Sun Valley Brewing;Good head and nice lacing atop a golden copper brew. Aroma is American hops and slight caramel malts... one-dimentional.

Flavor is munich malt dominant with supporting caramel sweetness, faint sourness and moderate bittering without any flora. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, with a low carb texture. Overall, a yummy brown ale with a great blend of malt characteristics; not sure if I had a different brew from these guys, but it definitely wasn�t an IPA."
Sun Valley Roundhouse IPA;Hailey, Idaho, United States;IPA;Sun Valley Brewing;Tangy, tropical grapefruit nose with a big fluffy white cloud of foam. Comes across very sour and imbalanced on the palate and I believe this might be infected. Will have to try again in the future at a later date.

Sun Valley Roundhouse IPA;Hailey, Idaho, United States;IPA;Sun Valley Brewing;Tap at brewpub: Clear gold with a white head. Hoppy aroma abounds, but only a mild hop flavor.

Santa Barbara Hefeweizen;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Tap at brewpub. Pale, golden color, hazy with a puffy head and a lemon in my glass. Aroma isn�t quite as pungent as the better wheat beers I�ve tried, but clovey, some esters, and a little bit of maltiness. Spicy, a hint of banana, goes down really smooth. Light bodied, gentle texture in the mouth. A bit more in terms of the spicy, phenolic character and this would be a great hefe, not a bad quaffer on a summer evening as it is.
Santa Barbara Hefeweizen;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;During Graduation trip 2005. Sample at the pub. Came looking pale, hazy yellow. Served with a lemon wedge. Frothy light head. Aroma was dominated by the lemon wedge but had some other minimal aromas (thought I got some wheat and malt). Not bad.

Selins Grove Mai-Bock;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Served on-tap at the brewpub into a goblet. A - Pours clear amber orange with a nice one finger tall white head leaving little to no lacing down the glass. S - Smell is dominated by the sweet caramel malt. It also has hints of bready malt, light peppery spice, and a dash of earthy hops. Simple yet enjoyable. T - Starts off with lots of sweet caramel malt slowly giving way to hints of chewy biscuity malt, light spice, and just the faintest hint of earthy hop bitterness. I can detect little to no alcohol in this one. The finish has a little bit of chewiness with a good bit of sugary sweetness, lingering for only a short period of time. M - Medium-Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sweet, chewy, feel with little of it lingering through the finish. O - Pretty good. An excellent example of the style. I would encourage you to get it if it is on as it is something you wont see every day at the brewpub, having been not made for two years until now.
Selins Grove Mai-Bock;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Pours golden from tap. Not a ton of aroma. Nice balanced taste. Hides the 7.7 very well. In fact this is one that will sneak on you.
Selins Grove Mai-Bock;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub on 7/25/08: Pours a clear dark golden brass color with a wispy-lacing stringy white head. Aroma of sweet toasty German malts and some earthy noble hops. Body starts with some authentic sweet maltiness and decent bitter balance toward a drier more bitter finish. A pretty decent maibock.
Selins Grove Mai-Bock;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Draft at brewpub. Poured a cloudy golden in color with a nice medium sized frothy white head with great lacing. Aroma is sweet, bready, with a nice hop presence. Tastes of sweet caramel, candi sugar, moderate spices, bready with a great body and mouth feel. Hops very present in the finish. Nice.
Selins Grove Mai-Bock;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;"Draft @ Selins Grove. Pours an effervescent, bright golden-orange color; creamy, marshmallow-like head with excellent retention and lacing; gorgeous pour. Basic cereal and fruitiness (a touch overripe) in the aroma; somewhat resigned. Medium-to-full mouthfeel: chewy candy sugar, caramel, and sweet, basic maltiness; kind of heavy in the mouth, lightly carbonated; slightest touches of alcohol. Lengthy finish: some lasting mineral bitterness shows through, with breadiness and yellow fruits."
Selins Grove Mai-Bock;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;Pint at Selins Grove. Honey orange colored body with a small, white head. Huge, deep, syrupy nose of sweetened corn, dried leaves, wood, dried vegetables, peppery honey and a touch of that 7.7% alcohol. Thick, chewy and syrupy in the mouth, peppery, spicy and sharp throughout, full body, without a doubt fuller and heavier than it ever needs to be, but it actually tastes very fresh, meaty and fruity, with a sharp orange/caramel malt note throughout.
Selins Grove Mai-Bock;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;On tap at the brewpub. Pours a slightly hazy gold with a moderate linen white head that lasted through the fiirst quarter of the glass. Light, fairly indistinct aroma with a few notes of malt and bread. The flavor begins with some light malt and finishes with some moderate-strong bitterness. Some lingering dryness after the swallow and a bread flavor emerges in the aftertaste as well. This one didn�t really do much for me.
Selins Grove Mai-Bock;Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Selins Grove Brewing Co.;On tap at the Selins Grove Brew fest. Aroma is malt in a vanilla sugar type way, just asolutely massive. The flavor is as intensly malty as a good ipa is hoppy, punches you in the face with toffee, bread, and slightly nutty flavors. medium bodied. pretty good.

Ramapo Valley Paranoia Pilsner;Hilburn, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Tap at Brewtopia. Nice clear golden white head. Aroma of hops and malt, maybe a touch of DMS in there as well. Flavor is nice and malty with a good dose of hops. A touch of butterscotch in the finish, but not too bad. Nice lingering hops. Decent effort on a difficult to make beer.
Ramapo Valley Paranoia Pilsner;Hilburn, New York, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Ramapo Valley Brewery;Brewtopia�04. Smells a bit like an old shoe. Sweet, canvas, grass, band-aid, toffee. Some sweet cardboard on tongue, then front yard hits the flavor with weeds, grass, dirt, and fertilizer. I didn�t get the hops I was hoping for even after a second-chance sample later in the day. Still, okay and drinkable. I had the second glass with my pork sandwich.

Barley Creek American Amber Lager;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;This was a pretty decent amber lager. It was very similar to Yuengling in color and taste, but a nice try from the brewers at Barley Creek.
Barley Creek Pocono Bitter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"At the Barley Creek Summerfestival today the Hefe Wiezen was the good surprise of the day. This beer, the Pocono Bitter was a bit of a let down today. The Bar tender told me it was an ESB but it certainly wasn�t that. It is a very unique. Appearance: Served on-tap at the brewery it came a light amber color. Smell: Very very light grassy sour bitter aroma with a hint of a malt presence. Taste: A bit strange. Not awful significant grassy character up front a touch of malt and then a strong sour aftertaste. I was not a big fan of this aftertaste but it was not appalling either; just different. Mouthfeel: Thin and watery. Left the beer feeling a bit limp. Drinkability: This not the most impressive beer that Barley Creek makes so I would try the Rescue IPA instead. IMHO. Hope this is helpful. Cheers!"
Barley Creek Pocono Bitter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;"On tap at Barley Creek. Pours a clear gold with moderate, creamy white head. Not very aromatic; some light hops aroma but that was about it. Crisp and bitter, although not overpowering. Maybe a bit thin on the finish. An easy beer to drink."
Barley Creek Pocono Bitter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;2.24.06 Decent though unspectaular bit-bit. Not bad just easily forgettable. Maybe with a little more accentuation and body in the malt this coudl have had better prospects. Oh well.
Barley Creek Pocono Bitter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Draft pours a clear gold with a white head. Aroma of grains. Taste was crisp and refreshing. Although the beer definately lacks depth. This was a miss for me. Not terrible but could have been much better.
Barley Creek Pocono Bitter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;I think I had a good batch yesterday, however, this is particularly odd for a bitter. When I think of bitters, I think of sitting in an English pub with a creamy pint that has bitter aftertones to it. This starts with a sweet lemony cascade and ends with a slight bittery note. The finish is a bit wet as well but its one of the most enjoyable brews on tap.
Barley Creek Pocono Bitter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;on tap at bcbc, a mild hop and malt mixture comes off a golden pour with thin white lacing. each mouthfull of this was a blend of sweetness and bitterness. the front end was a sweet malt flavor, followed by the expected bitterness. a nice transition, but the body was a little on the thin side. i liked this beer for its easy drinkability..it went down very smooth and wasnt overwhelming in its bitterness.
Barley Creek Pocono Bitter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;Gold pour with minimal head. Aroma of malt, hops...this one is more sweet than bitter. Not much in body or complexity. A disappointment.
Barley Creek Pocono Bitter;Tannersville, Pennsylvania, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Barley Creek Brewing Co.;I was not impressed by this beer. It actually appeared to be a nitro pour and was orange in color with a thick white head. The taste was a bit flat and bland, with stale hops coming through at the end. This is one I would pass on unless if was on the house.
Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;Bottled at Monks Cafe, Stockholm. Pours out in a clear dark ruby brown colour with a low creamy off-white foam. Malty aroma of nuts and fudge with salty undertones. Medium-to lightbodied with notes ofnut-shells, cocoa and fudge. Salty finish of dudge and berries.
Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;Bottle. Dark brown with a fierce beige head that quickly diminished. Roasted malts aroma with tart berries. Flavours feel fat, buttery, and with smoked notes. A bit too light-bodied for all this. Drinkable.
Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;Cask gravity at Pigs Ear BF 07. Charcoaly chocolatey mild. Not sure why no one else had this at the time, I must have drunk the half pint myself.
Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;Bottle. Dark brown with a beige foam. Aromas are roast malts with chocolate and acidic berries. Quite earthy in its hopping. Flavours are coffee and berries with yeast. Some hints of chocolate in the background. Gritty grain towards the finish with a dry finish.
Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;A Mes rate: Gravicask @ Pigs Ear. Had this down as Uncle Stuarts Mild in my notebook but having looked at the program it seems I had a dry hopped, festival special version of Pack Lane. Not sure what the point is in dry hopping a mild. Surely that defeats the object? Whatever it was bloody good. Mahogany coloured with a thin but tenacious head. Very good condition. Lovely coffee and malt with a grainy, mineral like character. Some very pleasing toasted marshmellow notes right in the back ground. Pretty straight forward but very quaffable and enjoyable.
Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;Bottle. A little bit thin, with some light saltyness. Slightly smoky, with touches of roasty malt. There is some nice flavour in here, but the finish is a bit too watery.

Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;A dark reddish brown beer with a frothy beige head. The nose is light, malty with a touch of spice. The taste is malty, with a strong sour, appley, citrus flavour to follow. There is a hint of spice in the finish. Bottle conditioned, purchased from the brewery�s stall at the 2005 Royal Norfolk Show. Disappointing!
Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;From A Bottle.Black with a small head,aroma hops,black tea and dark malts,taste of old red wine, malt smoke blackberry,dark choc,wet wood leather and the rain,long dry clean finish.
Uncle Stuarts Pack Lane;Norwich, Norfolk, England;Mild Ale;Uncle Stuarts;What is this? Is it a bitter? Is it a mild? Whatever it is, it�s not very good. The colour is deepish brown, but not that dark. The nose and palate are dominated by undeveloped cereally malt - rather reminiscent of porridge. Very little hop presence, leading to an unbalanced beer. Grainy mouthfeel. I can�t imagine it is supposed to taste like this, so I�ll put it down to poor beer festival conditioning and gives this another go if I get the chance. Cask (gravity), Catford Beer Festival.
White Marsh California Amber Ale;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;White Marsh Brewing Company (Red Brick Station Brew Pub);Amber with a medium white head, hoppy grapefruity aroma, flavor is moderately sweet caramel, sticky, with grapefruit and pine in the finish. Decent.

Aroma is medium sweet, fruity, light grapefruit. Taste is mild sweet, earthy, grapefruit, light peach. Fairly bitter grapefruit/earthy finish. Medium body, bit of resin. Surprised by the bitterness based on the mildness of the aroma.
Off the Rail Coal Porter;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Porter;Off the Rail Brewery;Nice dark chocolate brew in all senses of the word. The head is dark and coffee like, the body is just full coffee/chocolate/malt goodness.
Off the Rail Coal Porter;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Porter;Off the Rail Brewery;Pours black with a generous head. Slightly sweet and roasty, but with a bitterness that complements the roasted malt nicely. Overall - full flavor, but not at all cloying, with a slight bitterness that makes for quite a drinkable porter.
Off the Rail Coal Porter;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Porter;Off the Rail Brewery;Tap... Poured black with a big, light brown head. Aroma was roasted with a hint of caramel. Flavors were chalky with some malt grains and sweet caramel and chocolate. Sort of dry towards the finish.

Rathays Tremletts Bitter Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Rathays Cider;A Mes rate: Barrel at Manc Winter Fest. Dakrish golden brown coloured. Dry earthy aroma with plenty of tannin. Flavour is also heavily laden with tannin and is so ridiculously dry it removes pretty much all the moisture from your mouth. Enjoyable loopy juice. Madness.
Rathays Tremletts Bitter Cider;Hereford, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Rathays Cider;An uncompromising, mouth-puckeringly dry cider made from a traditional English cider apple. Faint apple aroma, but the fruit is entirely fermented out. Some might find it rather austere, but, for me, it went down a treat. Cider like it used to be. Splendid stuff, but definitely falling-over juice. Cask, Catford Beer Festival.
Pumphouse Blackberry Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;On tap at Pumphouse poured a cloudy amber with a small lasting offwhite head. Aromas of bread dough, wheat and a hint of blackberry. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of wheat, blackberry and yeast with a crisp fruity finish.
Pumphouse Blackberry Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;tap at brewery. thick grapefruit juice pour. light fruity aroma. sour fruit. juicy.
Pumphouse Blackberry Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draft at the brewery. Cloudy soft orange color. Full body, chewy wheat throughout, a bit on the sweet side from the berry flavoring, but not overdone. Plastic-like all-purpose berry flavoring, artificial, resembles nutri-sweet at times... nothing too impressive, but it does have a a nice and full body from the wheat.
Pumphouse Blackberry Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draught at brewpub. Pours hazy ruby with a small, diminishing, frothy white head, fair lacing. Aroma is light malt (straw, grain), light hops (grass), light yeast (sweat) with notes of blackberry. Light bodied, sticky texture, average carbonation and a chalky finish. Short duration, light sweetness, acidity and bitterness.
Pumphouse Blackberry Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;Draught, Pumphouse, Longmont. Head is mostly diminishing. Body is hazy light amber. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately yeasty (dough), with a note of lemon rind, maybe a hint of generic berries. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. I had to try reeeeaalll hard to convince myself there was any blackberry essence in this. I let it warm up, swirled, you know, doing my best to conjure up some kind of fruity berry character, but it never really materialized. Lotsa doughy vitamin B stink from the yeast, unfortunately. The flavor balance is good, though. But don�t go into this expecting much fruit character, other than the obligatory American Wheat lemon rind.
Pumphouse Blackberry Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;"Cloudy and light orange; thinnish head, but nice lace. Palate was light and refreshing. Malts were grainy and bready, and a little wheaty. Very little sweetness. Some sourness and a little tartness. Blackberry flavor/aroma was a nice addition; not overdone, either."
Pumphouse Blackberry Wheat;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Pumphouse Brewery and Restaurant;"Quite the pleasant summer fruit-wheat. I had bought one for my female companion while I was having the doppel; after I tasted this wheat I decided to have one of my own. Not overly wheaty or fruity - it justs tastes nice and refreshing."
Hoppers Helms Imperial IPA;Palm Harbor, Florida, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Hoppers Grille & Brewery;"We had this today over at the Hoppers on East Lake Rd (aka McMullen-Booth Rd in Palm Harbor). I�ve always liked the ales at this place. No, they�re not the greatest, but they�re a damn sight better than any macro-crap. The big chalk board listing the days selections caught my attention with the ""Imperial IPA - 10.2%"". My wife tried some with me. The color was fine, a deep coppery gold. The off-white head looked proper, and stayed with us for nearly the entire glass. Aroma is of hops, a little fruitiness, and then some more hops. I wouldn�t say it was a super smooth mouthfeel, but it wasn�t bad. The taste just slams your senses to the ground with hops. Then it has the nerve to hit them again while they�re on the mat. My wife hinted at a grapefruit taste with which (after a few sips) I concurred. You can taste every big of it�s high alcohol content. I�m guessing there wasn�t much of an attempt to mask it. That�s fine by me. It blended nicely with the bitter hop aftertaste. If you�re in the area you should swing by and give it a try. No, it�s not a Stone Ruination IPA nor is it a Dogfish Head 90 or 120. What it is...well....it�s a pretty darn good hoppy brew."
Herman M�rzen;Turku, Finland;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Panimoravintola Herman;Dark coppery colored, little yellow head. Slightly cloudy appearance. Sweet, caramelly, even slightly licoricy nice aroma, lemon and slight yeast also there. Medium bodied, crispy palated.

Herman M�rzen;Turku, Finland;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Panimoravintola Herman;Cloudy golden-amber, with a finger of foam. Toasty, caramelly aroma. Quite toasty in the body, almost smoky. Slightly hazelnutty. Quite a full body. Toasty finish that is slightly sweet. It does what a marzen needs to do, but I�m hardly enamoured with it.
Herman M�rzen;Turku, Finland;M�rzen / Oktoberfest Bier;Panimoravintola Herman;Sampled draught at the brewpub. Cloudy amber, small head. Malt aroma. Fairly sweet with pleasant, firm, rounded maltiness. Lightly roasty with some toffee, low bitterness. Well made and well balanced.

Herman Weizen;Turku, Finland;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Panimoravintola Herman;Light chill haze - golden - I�m inclined to call this a kristal weizen, though. Aroma is predominantly banana, with the merest hints of clove, cinammon, and pear. Soft body, very sweet, perhaps a little too much so. Banana, bubblegum and light spice again. Fairly full body for the style. Seems like a low wheat ratio, too, by the flavour. Functional example.

Orangey colour, I thought, with a big fluffy head and good lacing. Good fruit flavour, with a big hoppy boost towards the finish. Not harsh, just tangy and fresh. In one word - juicy.

Huppendorfer Pils;K�nigsfeld-Huppendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Brauerei Grasser Huppendorfer;Pours a clear, pale golden coloration with a medium, foamy head and visible carbonation. Smells of sweet'ish, doughy, biscuity malt and herbal, grassy hops. Taste is a pretty even balance between some sweet'ish, slightly toasted doughy, bready malt and quite herbal and grassy, but also somewhat floral hops coming through a bit more towards the finish, with just a hint of hay and a certain mineral note as well. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some bready malt and herbal hops lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation. I'm not really a Pilsner Person, but this does have a very niceand even balance of sweet, bready malt and herbal, grassy, somewhat floral hops going for it, almost like a cross between a German and Bohemian Pilsner.

Pizza Port Mo Betta Bretta;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Big thanks to CaptainCougar for this whale!! Clear gold with huge carbonation, bottle from the original batch. Apple flesh, lactic tartness, pear, earth cheesecloth abound on the nose. The flavor brings white peach, tannic champagne, with a beautiful dry finish. It�s held up pretty damn well I would say.
Pizza Port Mo Betta Bretta;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);Huge, huge thanks to CaptainCougar for this very longtime want. Original batch. Served in a snifter. The pour yields a well-carbonated straw-golden-colored brew with a nice white head that falls somewhat quickly, leaving a bit of lacing behind. The nose is quite complex, filled with notes of hay and grass atop some green apple, pineapple, and lemon. Wheaty dryness comes through the nose, though apparently wheat wasn�t used in this brew. The spices are gone, but the Brett notes have really come to the forefront and are absolutely delicious. Straw and some lemon and pineapple notes come through. Earthy character in the background. Body is light-medium with a very dry finish. Absolutely exquisite. Was thrilled to finally see this bottle and it absolutely delivered. Thanks again!
Pizza Port Mo Betta Bretta;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);honey good, thin white head fizzles out quick. Nose is honey pineapple, bit of sawdust. Flavor is more skin, mineral and ultra dry champagne consistency, bit sweet and at front. Bit empty, but I like palate and light mineral profile.
Pizza Port Mo Betta Bretta;Solana Beach, California, United States;Sour / Wild Beer;Pizza Port (Solana Beach);750mL original batch. Mega whale thanks to CaptainCougar. Slow gusher. Over carbonated. Rich, rocky head head diminishes quickly. Rich white wine and lemon sorbet nose. Baked cherries and grilled pineapple. Taste is aerated, neutral. Mild boozy heat in the backend. Super minerally and dry palate. Refreshing. Simple. Brett complexities in the nose. Mild acid in taste. A bit bland. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Herman Pils;Turku, Finland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Panimoravintola Herman;Draught (Herman, Turku). Rich yellow, unfiltered. Not much aroma, lightly grassy, probably as it was served quite cold. Sweet hoppy taste though, which stays for a decent finish. Not my style, a bit thin, but vastly better than any macro.
Herman Pils;Turku, Finland;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Panimoravintola Herman;Unfiltered, beautiful hazy deep golden yellow - quite dark for a pils - with small white head. Sweetish aroma. Full, fruity hop flavor, with even hoppier finish.

Off the Rail Paranoid IPA;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;IPA;Off the Rail Brewery;Off the Rail Paranoid IPA Excellent well balanced taste. It was a Great tasting IPA that did not come up to your throat unlike other IPA's. You can actually drink this all night and would not feel the overfilling overhoppy overtrying to much critic conscious beer. Pissed off when the bar replaced it with that crappy Ninkasi garbage IPA
Off the Rail Paranoid IPA;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;IPA;Off the Rail Brewery;On tap a Momo�s with Justin, Kristen and Vincent. Pours golden/yellow with white foam. Smells lightly hopped with hints of citrus. Tastes slightly belgiany with some bitter hops.

Off the Rail Paranoid IPA;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;IPA;Off the Rail Brewery;Tap @ Old Chicago Beaverton: Light golden pour, small white head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Damn this is way too cold! Warms a bit to more hops with a little wheat. Tastes fruity, wheaty, and the overall hops role is minimal. This is pretty weak...
Off the Rail Paranoid IPA;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;IPA;Off the Rail Brewery;Draft at Old Chicago. Pour was a very light golden, with little to no head. Aroma of mostly malt. Had mostly a malt taste with a small hint of hops, almost like you could taste the hop oil but not the hops. My friend put it best, it is like you poured half a glass of a IPA and filled it the rest of the way with Bud Light
Off the Rail Paranoid IPA;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;IPA;Off the Rail Brewery;Tap... Poured pale orange with a white head. Aroma of lemon-citrus and hops. Hop flavors were pretty quiet and some balancing grain characters as well. Everything seemed subdued in the brew. Just needs more hops and more of an aggresive palate. Maybe a good pale ale or a good east coast IPA, but not enough to please hopheads.
Off the Rail Paranoid IPA;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;IPA;Off the Rail Brewery;Draft. A nice copper/orange hue although a bit hazy. Still pleasant appearance. Low head retention with minimal lacing. Some citrus hop nose, but a little low for an IPA from the PNW. Slight hop character in the finish but the bu�s resemble a mild pale ale. Clean beer but almost too balanced.
Off the Rail Paranoid IPA;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;IPA;Off the Rail Brewery;A wonderful IPA with a little something extra. Very smooth with powerful floral and fruity overpinnings. Very smooth finish. Definitely a superior drinking experience. I love this stuff.

Smells slightly of floral hops and slight caramel notes. Taste is rather bland with some floral notes and caramel and yeast come through in aftertaste. Watery and not that great.
Off the Rail Derail Pale Ale;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Off the Rail Brewery;"On Tap @ Rogue Bones & Brew Fest in Portland: This was my wife�s favorite at Bones and Brew. It pours a dark gold and is ULTRA cloudy. It has an initial bitter taste, then it turns sweet on you leaving a great flavor of balanced ""hoppy malts."" The body was full and easy to drink. I wish it was in bottles - it would be a regular at my place."
Off the Rail Sweetleaf Amber;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Off the Rail Brewery;very good hoppy malty balance. ambers aren�t my go to beers but this one is really solid. had on draft at beulahland, portland.
Off the Rail Sweetleaf Amber;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Off the Rail Brewery;This was a suprisingly good beer. Ambers are not my favorite style, but they are a littly lighter and prevent beer belly. This was darker in color. Very sweet malty body. Not overly estery, or malty, or lacking of hops, just sweet and good. Definetly one of my new favorites. I wish Off the Rail sold in bottles.
Off the Rail Bootlegger Wheat;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Wheat Ale;Off the Rail Brewery;Pours golden and bubbly, decent head. More full bodied than other wheats but still quite quaffable. Good with Hot Lips.
Off the Rail Blizzard of Oz;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Off the Rail Brewery;Tap... Poured a thick, cloudy orange with a white head, nice lacing. Spices and malted grains on the nose. Could of used a little more carbonation. Also, flavors were a little unbalanced on the tangy/sour side. Not the worst thing out there though. Sweet honey notes dominated through to the finish.
Off the Rail Blizzard of Oz;Forest Grove, Oregon, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Off the Rail Brewery;Not my thing but not bad. Yellowy orange with a medium white head. Smells of hay and has a slight pine smell as well. Taste is prodominently yeasty hay with a note of pine coming in at the end.

Market Cross Tell Me Rye Ale;Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Market Cross Pub and Brewery;Sampled on draft at the brewpub this beer poured a slightly hazy golden color with a medium sized foamy orange-white head that left a bit of lacing.

Enjoyable
Market Cross Tell Me Rye Ale;Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States;Specialty Grain - Other;Market Cross Pub and Brewery;Pint at the brewery. Light to medium yellow gold colored body with a white head. Syrupy, husky grains in the nose, rye, corn, wheat, cereal, etc. Sharp and biting flavor, which is expected with the rye sometimes, a bit heavy, a bit too thick and sharp, finishes with a stenchy sour and sugary grain and sweet corn flavor. Different.

Aroma of orange and pine. Nice balance of a variety of hops. Very smooth palate. One of the better IPAs I have sampled.
Drafting Room 10th Anniversary Ale;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Tr�egs Brewing Company;This came in a half-gallon growler jug courtesy of PisskyNights, many thanks to him. This poured out a clear dark amber color with good bubbling carbonation and a tall white head of foam peeking out of the glass. As the head receded down of a covering of bubbles it left good sheet of lace around the glass that clung to it for a while. Very pleasant aroma stirs from the glass with a nice blend of fruity sweet malts as well as a sharp citric hop smell. Definite notes of floral and piney hops as well mingle about to make this wonderful smelling brew. Quite the balanced nose as neither the malts nor the hops tend to dominate but at the same time both make their presence well known. Great flavor here with sweet caramel malt taste upfront followed by the citric piney bite of the hops. A nice crisp clean taste all around with a bitter finish, very tasty indeed. Mouthfeel is about medium with good carbonation. Obviously drinkability is not a problem with the entire growler being downed quite easily in one sitting and I wish I had more afterwards. A well-balanced and tasty IPA that I would highly recommend you try if you can get your hands on it.
Drafting Room 10th Anniversary Ale;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Tr�egs Brewing Company;On Tap. Poured a medium to dark orange color with a large off white head. Citrus aroma with some pine. Sweet. Honey, piney and orange tastes.

Drafting Room 10th Anniversary Ale;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Tr�egs Brewing Company;On tap at the bar. I was getting slightly wasted when I had this, but here are my notes. Sweet, sugary citrus aroma. Mildly hazy coppercolor. Lots of honey to start, leading to quite and intense bitter hoppiness. A sweet IIPA. Kinda like 120 minute, but not THAT sweet.
Drafting Room 10th Anniversary Ale;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Tr�egs Brewing Company;Extremely aromatic, bright and juicy aroma -- reminded me of LaConner Bottleworks, but with some woody tones. Sweet, slightly sugary nose, filled with grain and hop flowers. Graham cracker in the finish, along with pungent, fresh Florida grapefruit. Tasty and brilliantly crafted. Thanks Eric!
Drafting Room 10th Anniversary Ale;Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Tr�egs Brewing Company;Hazy coppery-orange. Fine-bubbled dusty-white head. Scents of grapefruit rind bathing in pine resin. Hint of lightly scorched caramel, nuts, and rich toasted malts. Tight carbonation with a thick, jellyish body. Beautifully rounded body carries the chewy caramel, which coats the palate and offsets the brash pine flavors, early on. Hint of apple acidity deepens the brew, but is mostly squelched by the thickness of the body and rich caramel malt. Late surge of leafy herbs and bitter pine restore the sharpness to the explosive tangerine hop aspects. Finishes with a plethora of savory hop bitterness, yet with oodles of soft, juicy hops and sweet toasted malts, nuts, and buttered caramel. Caramel aftertaste balances the lingering grapefruit and spicy evergreen. This is remarkably clean and focused, just as IPA should be. These guys exude nothing but mastery when it comes to the use of a hopback.

Aromat i smak s�odowy z wyczuwalnym alkoholem, ale nie jako� bardzo mocno. Goryczka niska. Og�lnie mocarne piwo, z ka�dym �ykiem czu� jego moc i wybitnie s�odowy charakter, przy tej s�odyczy alkohol jako� mocno nie przeszkadza i styl powinien chyba by� zmieniony na malt liqour, bo tak podaje sam producent na puszce, zw�aszcza �e faktycznie to piwo wyr�nia si� troch� na tle innych mocnych jasnych swoj� g�sto�ci�, wr�cz oleisto�ci�.

Tygrys Lodzki 20�;Lodz, Poland;Malt Liquor;Browary Lodzkie;I�ve read that during production of this beer Lodzkie Breweries use the same yeasts like in Porter Lodzki. It makes sense, because one of the feelings in aftertaste is similar in both. Quality for price is really good. But it is still usual strong lager and nothing else.
Tygrys Lodzki 20�;Lodz, Poland;Malt Liquor;Browary Lodzkie;"Pours a beautiful gold/amber with dissapating white head. Mild aroma. A little malty, a little earthy (peat?). Flavor starts malty. Has a fruity flavor; apples and peaches. Spicy dry finish. Really can�t taste the alcohol (8.1%?!?). You can feel it in the belly as you finish the can. Medium body. A nice lager. Much more balanced and easy drinking than other strong lagers I have had."

Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster Imperial IPA;Cleveland, Ohio, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Great Lakes Brewing (Ohio);12floz bottle, BBD: 09.10.2017, $3, pint glass. Amber colored DIPA with a sweet nose, and full-bodied with resin and plum flavors. Finishes with boozy heat. There is a maltiness to counter balance the hop bitterness. Some things are are right, then some things seem boring about this beer. In summary it is a mediocre DIPA/IPA for me.

Reddish brown with a nice standing tan head. I almost thought I sensed a roastiness in the aroma, but the first swallow is sweet. There�s a tart factor, too.

Seriously. Maybe it was just the right mix of weather, circumstances, temperament, or whatever, but this just really hit a sweet spot with me. Maybe the best brew in the pub�s selection.

Huppendorfer Hausbrauerart;K�nigsfeld-Huppendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Grasser Huppendorfer;Fresh bottle purchased and consumed at the brewery in Dec. 2013: Hazed pumpkin golden. Creamy but broken white head. Dull nose of sulfur, tobacco, soggy breadcrust, DMS and paper. Loose prickles of carbonation. Opens with subdued malty softness and curiously reserved Spalt-reserved fennel seed hoppiness. Lifeless, generic, one-dimensional malt lacks definition and crisp structure, and instead comes off as wet hay and paper. Light DMS notes emerge and further muddle things. Finishes soft and muted, with a hint of cookie, haylike malt and fuzzy DMS. Not very memorable.
Huppendorfer Hausbrauerart;K�nigsfeld-Huppendorf, Bavaria, Germany;Zwickelbier/Kellerbier/Landbier;Brauerei Grasser Huppendorfer;Bottle at the brewery.

Light to medium body, watery texture, lively/fizzy carbonation. Weird eucalyptus sort of spicy note, and plenty of DMS as well. Otherwise a bit rough and forgettable (like all beers I�ve had from this brewery).

This is the Hausbrauerart, the regular Vollbier left unfiltered. Stale tasting and metallic on first whiff. Oxidized malt, grassy herbal hops, nutty malt. Gritty and crunchy body, stale ashy cara-malt flavor. Medium body, medium bitterness, balanced but crusty and coarse malt texture. Possible mild sign of infection / faint lactic sourness. I fear the bottles have not preserved the beer well, as the filtered Vollbier vom fass had a much brighter orange-citrus hop character and the malt was fresh.

New South Nut Brown Ale;Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, United States;Brown Ale;New South Brewing;Sampled at Art Burger in Myrtle Beach, SC. Ok malt content and balance.

Steinburg Cerveza con Gaseosa;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;50 cL bottle. Pours pale yellow with small white head. Cornish and acidic aroma. Sweet fruity, light citrusy. Quite sweet lasting impression with a mild citrus fruity flavour into the finish. Overall: sweet and lemonish fruity. A bit too sweet for my liking.
Steinburg Cerveza con Gaseosa;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;Can, 3.9%. Subtle metallic aroma. Clear yellow colour. Very small white head. The flavour has a little sweet to start with, then turns more beery in the macro lagery way. This is probably the optimal mixing ratio for Radler.
Steinburg Cerveza con Gaseosa;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;pale yellow body and white head. fruity aroma and lime too. sweet in taste. refreshing, but nothing else.
Steinburg Cerveza con Gaseosa;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;50 cl can, in La Manga, Spain. Clear golden color, moderate white head. Fruity sweetness, malt, no hops. Refreshing.
Steinburg Cerveza con Gaseosa;Oettingen, Bavaria, Germany;Radler / Shandy;Oettinger Bier Gruppe;Can (BB 08/2007) Pale yellow color, small white head. Light skunky nose with artifical aroma of lime. Bitter start, then very watery. Mainly flavor is the mix of vague malts and artifical lime fruit. No aftertaste. Useless even as a radler.
Great Waters Anchorhead IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Poured a hazy peach/amber color with a very large clump of white soapsuds-like foam. Excellent lace throughout the pint. Light citrus smell. Good tasting, citrussy IPA - hops like grapefruit. Quite bitter (in a nice way), with more grapefruit in the aftertaste. Medium-bodied, it could have used just a hair more malt complexity, but still very very tasty. Exceptionally smooth carbonation, very creamy - I really liked that part of the beer. A lot.
Great Waters Anchorhead IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;A titch hazy, with a deep amber glow and colors from the yellow spectrum arrayed in the glass. Good dense head and a clean line on the body. Lovely fresh pine aroma and the essence of Walt Disney World in the air. The cask gives it a nice smooth palate. The bitterness is timid and beautiful. I had a really impressive visit to the Great Waters after visiting a number of times a few years back. (cask conditioned and handpulled at brewpub)
Great Waters Anchorhead IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Tap @ brewpub. Rich golden color with a foamy light brown head. Floral and wonderfully hopped with pine. I was very impressed by both IPAs (this and the Imperial IPA) for their balanced attack.
Great Waters Anchorhead IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Very appealing peachy color in this IPA, with a lush white head, a flurry of cascading, cask-driven activity. Nose is very inviting, hoppy, redolent with fruity notes, pineapple, citrus, and pine. Lively and attractive. Much less bitterness appears on the palate, as well as less flavor than I�d anticipated, but this is still tasty. Lacks the kind of bite I prefer in an IPA, and is ultimately all about smoothness. Cask-conditioning makes for a very creamy mouthfeel, and while it easily slips past the lips, it�s not a very memorable representative of the style. (Although I�ve had 3 pints in the past week, what can I say, I�m just an IPA kind of guy!)
Great Waters Anchorhead IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;Again...I�m not a huge IPA fan....but I still thought this a very good beer....and it�s due credit....Dark Amber Coloring. Thick Head. Fruit...pineapple? Hops...Worth getting again.
Great Waters Anchorhead IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;On Cask: After seeing the ratings for this brew at what I have considered an ify brewpub (in terms of beer quality) I decided to make an unlikely jaunt to try out this beer. Not bad. Not up to snuff either, in my opinion. Maybe I�m just spoiled with Town Hall�s offerings, but I found this to be better than their usual products, but still lacking. The nose was almost present and the flavor, as is unfortunately the case with most of their casks, seemed watered down. The flavor never bursts forth from the glass like, say, with the Masala Mama IPA from Town Hall. It came across as a very floral Pale Ale. The hops were too soft for me. I wanted to like this more, but was underwhelmed...again.
Great Waters Anchorhead IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;"Cask. Dark amber color and very cloudy. The white head is about an inch thick and just refuses to depart. Aroma is tempting: slight hops, some citrus, and other floral notes. The taste was great. Full of hops and flowers, grass, lemon... there is a small bit of malt character on the end. The mouthfeel was ludicrous; sweet, slipery, velvet... One of the best IPAs I�ve ever had. I think I need to make a run back there before it goes away for the season."
Great Waters Anchorhead IPA;St. Paul, Minnesota, United States;IPA;Great Waters Brewing;"On-cask: Stained coppery amber color with a dusty whitish firm crown about a finger high, amazing staying power. It lurks on top ever present and soupy with a creamed look leaving lacing in lots of webby stickings. Aroma is pretty nice, good hop nose of dryish leafy hops that nudges some lemon citrus but grapefruit zest and touches of peach really seem to dominate over a light toasty malt backing. More of a melon and tame orange dominates in some areas. Good tasting IPA here, complexing hop profile with grasses, resin, grapefruit, peach, solid Cascade bittering with a nice piney twinge. Kinda zippy, has a good mouthfeel and punch with a clean, full, and sorta fluffyness to its body. Solid hop bittering and a toasted malt backing keeping a decent balance for some good warm weather drinking. Another nice ""new"" brew from Great Waters. I�ll be looking forward to more cask offerings from this new brewer. Keep em coming!"

Kellys Brewpub Scottish Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Amber pour with creamy tan head and lace. Aroma is caramel malt. Caramel malt, light earthy hops, and a nice abv warmth. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Nice beer.
Kellys Brewpub Scottish Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Hazy light copper color with almost no head. Decent toffee and alcohol aroma and taste with a creamy palate.
Kellys Brewpub Scottish Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;I�d have it again. I appreciate a Scotch ale that tones down the smokiness, but I like compensation in texture and roasted sweetness, which this batch didn�t deliver. However, the most exotic tap on when I was there last and I am glad for it.
Kellys Brewpub Scottish Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Clear, thin brown body with an amber tone. Aroma of brown sugar and peat smoke. Flavor is very peaty plus caramel, vegetal notes, and moderate residual sweetness. Thin, mostly flat body. A poor rendition of a style that is difficult to mess up.
Kellys Brewpub Scottish Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Scottish Ale;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Pours a cloudy brown with a medium off white head. Light smoked peat aroma. More smokey peat in the flavor. Has a small touch of chocolate in the flavor. Lightly sweet.

Kellys Brewpub Red Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Clear reddish with no head. Faint malty aroma and taste with some grainy notes.
Kellys Brewpub Red Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Everything I dislike about Irish reds: thin, no sub-flavors, and a wicked grainy finish like a mouthfull of grass. I wish I could detect the notes that whaleman picks up, because that would have helped it for me.
Kellys Brewpub Red Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Amber-brown body and silky off-white head that faded. Rich caramel nose with a burnt phenolic note plus butterscotch. Flavor is of over-caramelized malt, a strong grapey fruity quality, and mild diacetyl. Very little hop character.
Kellys Brewpub Red Ale;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Pours reddish brown with a thin head. Lightly smokey with a touch of chocolate. Thin finish but a decent brew.
Kellys Brewpub Black Bitter;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;Tap @ Kelly�s. Not bad. Surprisingly full bitter taste that is nonetheless too sweet. Jet black color.

Kellys Brewpub Black Bitter;Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Kellys Restaurant & Brewpub;I didn�t really know what to call this so I left it as a bitter even though it is more of a schwarzbier or something else. Pours a very dark brown with a thin tan head. Mild roast aroma with a touch of hops. Nice roasted malt flavor with good hop balance. Finishes slightly dry and bitter. Nice.
Matt Private Mens Club Pilsner Light;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;A punishingly bad beer. Leaves a bilious aftertaste. It�s available in New York for $1.99, which cheaper than anything I�ve ever seen.
Matt Private Mens Club Pilsner Light;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;"I got cans of this stuff at a Kmart. This was flavorless and watery. It had a hint of sort of unidentifiable grain (corn?). Completely flat beer that had an ""infused"" taste of the aluminum can it was in; metallic and wierd tasting (It's like drinking aluminum flavored water). Huge quickly dissipating head dispite the lack of carbonation. No noticeable aroma and a very light yellow color. The can design of this light version of Private Mens Club was the same old fashion design except for the background which was yellow as opposed to the regular light blue. I only bought it because it looked funny and tasted just as I expected... bad. Don�t waste your money on this."
Wye Valley Mighty Morgan;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Cask (handpulled) at the Royal Oak, Ockbrook. Keenly hopped with a dry finish, worked OK with the fish �n chips but coudl have had more flavour.
Wye Valley Mighty Morgan;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Cask (gravity dispense), St Albans Beer Festival 2005. Bronze colour. Slightly hazy. Thin head, but there�s quite a prickly carbonation on the tongue. Resinous, spicy hop aroma. In the mouth its clean and dry, with a rather astringent, drying sharpness in the aftertaste. That gives it a quite refreshing feel. Some bitterness and plenty of juicy fruit. Quite nice.
Wye Valley Mighty Morgan;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;A Mes rate: Fairly decent stuff considering they make cars! Initially let down by an unpleasant aroma that smells like it is still fermenting and this comes through in the flavour at the finish too. Don�t let that put you off however because otherwise its good. Typical hoppy English ale with a bit of sweetness but not too much and some fruit and cream at the finish. Unusual but inviting chestnut / tan looks and held its head pretty much all the way down. Drinkable and morish.
Wye Valley Mighty Morgan;Bromyard, Herefordshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Wye Valley Brewery;Golden and thick looking beer with a constant head. The aroma is very light and smoothly hopped, and the flavour is very hopped, with a hint of caramel and very refreshing owing to its dry nature. Overall a good beer, very nice.

Nighthawk Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);This canned Malt Liquor poured a very large sized head of foamy finely sized mostly diminishing white colored bubbles that left behind a poor lacing. The body contained average carbonation, was transparent and light orange in color. Its aroma contained notes of mild malty floral. Its mouth feel is initially tingly thin with a mellow palate in the finish and without the typical bite of an ML. Its flavor contained thin malty notes. A very average Malt Liquor.
Nighthawk Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can. I am not a fan of this beer style, but surprisingly this one wasn�t too bad. Poured a small, white, creamy and smooth head that mostly diminished, fine-large sized bubbles, carbonation, transparent, and the hue was yellow. Nose was malty hint of corn. Flavor was malty. Tingly mouthfeel.
Nighthawk Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);not too bad afa malts go...in fact the other nighthawk was kinda good. it�s a malt all the way...corn and somewhat syrupy. i�d buy it in a pinch.
Nighthawk Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);aww yea, all kinds of respect goes out to heemer for hookin me up with this shizit. Its in a can, i dont know what color it is, looks like it could be a clear yellow, its malt liqour, does it really matter. tasts like the fermented remains of a can of corn, i dig it. Kinda got tha stale olde style aftertaste too.
Nighthawk Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);This is the best smelling malt likka Ive had. Some sugar and citrus. It doesnt smell like an unflushed urinal which is unusual for the style. Light yellow color. A big citrus flavor. This is extremely smoooooth. Thank to Heemer for this one.
Nighthawk Ice;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);I first rated this as Nighthawk then realized why my can was a different color. Anyway, got this just for fun. Truly, not bad for a malt liquor. Small white head with a light yellow colored body. Aroma is malt and corn. The taste is surprisingly smooth and a little metallic. Good enough that I drank the whole can. I ahve had this many times now, it is a decent malt liquor.
Archers Hey-Ho;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask, Beverley Inn, Doncaster. Clear and straw coloured, thin white head. Hops, slightly acetic in the nose. Grass in the mouth, some maltiness, thin, bit of tannin.
Archers Hey-Ho;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Clear gold in colour. Grassy hops with some fish oil? Sweet malts, a little unbalanced. Weird psuedo lager, with a slightly buttery thin finish.
Archers Hey-Ho;Swindon, Wiltshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Archers (Evan Evans);Cask@The Red Lion, Isleworth, London. Slightly grassy, weedy character, some sweet pale malt, a bit thin i thought, and sweetish.

Blue Point Blueberry Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);It's got a great blueberry taste great pleasant Brew. Really it's summertime beer extremely light you can give it to someone that doesn't drink and they be able to get one down. Grape blueberry aftertaste. It's just super light and has a bit of a Seltzer feel which is okay I guess.
Blue Point Blueberry Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Original Review 3/23/2011: Have only had maybe 4 or 5 blueberry beers, but this is the best one. Can't wait to buy a 6-pack to get the full effect. Not overwhelming of fruit, but the taste is there and the rest of the beer is smooth and crisp. The old blueberry wheat from Sea Dog was my choice before this, but this is more of a clearer pilsnery version which IMO works better. May be a bit pricey @ $10/six for only 4.3%, but only live once and worth the extra buck or so.
Blue Point Blueberry Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Bottle. Sweet blueberry aroma with notes of crackery malt and grassy hops. Pours clear, pale golden colored with a thin off white head that has good retention and excellent lacing. Starts with sweet blueberry flavors as well as some crackery malt. Finishes smooth with grassy hops joining the blueberry sweetness. Ok, but one sided.
Blue Point Blueberry Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);"25-08-2018; bottle; at home (bought online at www.drankgigant.nl, Oost-Souburg, The Netherlands). The looks of the beer are that of a fine Pale Lager. With a pale golden yellow color and crystal clarity the looks aren't that special. The beer bubbles lively. On top of the beer a thin layer of very rough almost immediately collapsing beer is formed. Not to special The smell of the beer is pretty intense. Upon opening the beer a clear and strong aroma of blueberry can be smelled. It is a very natural blueberry aroma. Not a artificially added aroma. Sweet, fruity and quite nice. Very special, since I've never had a blueberry beer before. Besides blueberry there are some sweet malts and some slightly herbal hops, although the hops don't give that much smell. The blueberry is most prominent. The taste of the beer is rather simple, slightly boring even. Some sweet malts, some bitter hops and the blueberry isn't that strong in the taste. It is balanced, but a bit simple. The palate of the beer is fine. Light body, sticky texture and high carbonation. The finish is pretty nice. There are some clear blueberry notes there, exactly the same as those present after eating real blueberries. All in all, a fine beer. Very simple base of Pale Lager with a very nice, interesting and natural addition of blueberry. Nicely done."
Blue Point Blueberry Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Immediate aroma of blueberries as the beer is opened. Pours amber with a hint of color and a nice head. Lots of carbonation. Tastes like a plain old ale. Palate contains incredible blueberry notes, very sweet and a different type of blueberry sensation than is usually present in a blueberry ale. Blueberry is well layered so that it is only noticed on the nose. Crisp mouthfeel.
Blue Point Blueberry Ale;Patchogue, New York, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);355ml bottle. Clear golden colour with small, frothy, fading, white head. Initially rather intense blueberry aroma proves to be ephemeral, rather standard pale ale flavours of citrusy hop and biscuity pale malt remain. Taste is pale malty and slightly citrusy hoppy, only cautious hints of blueberry. Nice but quite anaemic overall.
Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Murky golden color with a white head. Sulfur, tart wheat aromas. Medium body. Lightly sweet pale malt flavor with lightly tart wheat. Not much clove or banana here.
Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Cloudyish yellow with light banana aroma notes that translate into a mildly sour banana flavor. Easy drinking, medium-bodied, and moderately flavored, though lack complexity. Mild wheatiness.

Appearance � Golden in color, thin head and clear. Flavor � Huge wheat malt flavor. This was a very nice German style wheat beer. Palate � Good Mouthfeel, nice texture with a dry finish.

Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;(Draught) Sampled at the Great Canadian Beer Festival 2007 in Victoria on September 8th, 2007. Spicy yeast. Nice banana. Smooth. Pretty good.
Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;GCBF sample. Cloudy dark yellow. Body is a little watery. Banana and toast aroma.
Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Draft at King�s Hardware in Ballard, WA. I like the effort here to make a Bavarian style wheat beer, but I cannot rate on effort alone. Upon first view, the beer was a nice cloudy yellow, with little head. FIrst aroma was butterscotch. This beer was infected, as the butterscotch overpowered the Bavarian characteristics I was excited for. I could taste some slight clove and banana. It was also extremely carbonated reminiscient of their pasteurized imported German counterparts. Second taste of this beer gives a lot better impression. Obviously it was an issue at the bar. Second tasting rendered this beer to be a nice rendition of a Bavarian Wheat. Clovey with some wheat notes and a crisp lemon finish. It was not overcarbonated, but rather smooth. Good stuff.
Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Draught, at the breweryInsanely sedimented. Massive fruity aroma. Bready, doughy, sweaty notes - puts the hefe in Hefe-Weiss. Quite tart, too, wheaty, with light phenols and sweat. Like a lot of their beers, it has a rustic edge.
Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;I had this one on tap at Floyd�s in Seattle. It had a cloudy, light-gold appearance. It had a wheaty flavor that dominated with hardly any hopping. There was a citrus flavor that eventually came through. All in all, not a bad beer.
Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;on tap at the college inn in seattle. hazy golden with a lasting craterous head. some vanilla and fresh wheat in the aroma, a little biscuity, not as thin as most american hefeweizens with some decent salty sourness in the finish
Baron Hefe-Weissbier;Seattle, Washington, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Baron Brewing & Lunar Brewing;Tap@The College Inn, Seattle. Fairly typical German style, but a bit thinnner in body and flavour, not as estery or yeasty either. Still failry nice, lemony, wheaty and peanuty. Refreshing, not bad.

Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Caramel, raisins, plums, figs, you get the idea - tongue coating, a bit of alcohol and damn I like this elixer.
Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Pours as dark brown as the soil on the fields at Bannockburn. Aroma is a caramel malt mix. Flavor starts Belgian, but the Scot inside its soul soon takes hold and doesn�t let go. Finishes with a nice, sweet malt flavor. Palate is slippery and delightful. Woohoo! Freeeeeeedooooooooooom!
Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;An opaque brown beer with a beutiful head. The aroma is very sweet and very fruity, combined with notes of raisins, and malt. The flavor is of prunes, raisins, alcohol, and burnt wood.
Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Aroma of wood, and alcohol. Colour is pomegranate, with a small toffee head. Flavour is certainly influenced by whiskey, quite woody too. Full bodied, both bitter and sweet. Terrific! Thanks joey_capps.
Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Dark brown w/ ruby hue. Creamy, frothy tan head. Rich malty aroma w/ notes of chocolate, coffee, wood, earthy, vanilla & light smoke. Smooth, medium/full-bodied feel. Falvour is malty, slightly sweet w/ notes of port & sherry. Finish is peppery & warming.
Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;Aroma strongly influenced by Vanilla beans, sweet malts, clean surrounded by alcohol. Great dry mocha roast, vanilla. Very smooth, full ale. Very potent but so drinkable with nice coffee sub theme.
Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;GABF 2004 Listed as Wee Woody: clear copper brown with a small off-white head. A powerfully malty and bourbon oaky aroma, yet very enticing. Mild sweetness in the body, but this is unbelieveably thin for some reason with an alcoholic burn in the finish. Don�t know quite what went wrong here, but I was very disappointed after the great aroma.
Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;"GABF 2004 - this was listed as ""Wee Woody"". Dark brown color. Soapy aroma has notes of maple syrup and chocolate. Sweet flavor, has vanilla and yeast, oak bitterness, and an unexpected spicy finish. A nicely sweet beer, it�s enjoyable. The barrel aging superceded whatever scotch ale flavors were in there in the first place, but it�s still nice."
Bitter End Whiskey Wee Heavy;Austin, Texas, United States;Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy;Bitter End Bistro & Brewery;I think this should be listed as a different beer than the Prescott�s since the whisky aging makes it completely different. Thanks for taking the time to change that Chad.. It pours a beautiful ruby red color with a great head and lacing. Very pronounced whisky aroma with a malt background. A lot of whiskey and oak with some smokey malt too. Creamy consistency with a silky finish

Ballards WMD;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ballards;Hazy red brown ale with no head. Sweet apples in aroma, cidery, very oxidized.

Ballards WMD;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ballards;Slight hazy amber-brown w/ almost no head. Aroma is malty (caramel, chocolate) & fruity (cooked apples, plums) but somewhat oxidized. Flat, lifeless feel. Flavour is reminiscent of caramel apples w/ some butterscotch & toffee. I didn�t find this beer nearly as bad as those with whom I shared (tiggmtl, CapFlu, Olivier_MTL, Goldorak, MartinT) but it was definitely past its prime.
Ballards WMD;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ballards;Bottled. Clear ruby, no head. Vinous nose. Very sweet with some caramel and chocolate as well as coffee. Full bodied and very salty. Comparing to Right Angler it is more fruity/berryish, and alcohol plays a more prominent part. Warming and intense.
Ballards WMD;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ballards;The label and beer name may well have been intended as a joke but it is in poor taste at best... Speaking of poor taste:Browned apples, marzipan, sherry and cardboard in the aroma. Opaque brown body with absolutely no head at all. Still and lifeless. Green apples and cardboard mar the caramel malt flavour with some suggestions of roasted/chocolate malts toward the mercifully quick finish. Medium body with no carbonation. Possibly once intersting flavours are ruined by a sad presentation. Bottle sampled with CapFlu, Goldorak, Joey_Capps, Olivier_MTL, Lubiere and MartinT.

Ballards WMD;Petersfield, West Sussex, England;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Ballards;Sceptic tank sewage brown, zero head. Bonus points go for the highly antagonizing label. Citrus, lime mostly, oxidized apple aroma. No carbonation at all, and tasted like a rusty penny marinated in maple sugar extract. Pass!

City Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);12 oz can, purchased for 70 cents....cold. Pours a clear, lifeless gold with a decent sized off-white head...which quickly vanishes with embarassment. Scent is faintly malt, slightly faint corn. Taste is even less so, but thankfully watery enough to distract you from the truth.....almost. Unbelievably ghastly.
City Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can. An almost imperceptible malt aroma. Golden with a small white head. Like the smell, and almost imperceptible malt flavor. The mineral water I like to drink has more flavor.

City Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);(can - 12 oz) Gold color with a fizzy white head. Aroma is corn, stale hops, and dry grass. Flavor is sour and rancid apple juice. Very sweet and cloying. Drain pour.

City Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);"Cheap and crappy. $8.99 for a 30 rack of these bad boys. I make an effort not to buy bad beer but some of my buddies bought this one and I happen to be in possession of a ""Das boot"" so I was obligated to drink this crappy beer. I of course wouldn�t buy this beer but it did go down reasonably smooth."
City Lager;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Can. Pours Golden with white head. Aroma is adjunct, sulfur and pear. Flavor is apples, pears and adjunct grains - mostly corn flavors. Palate is carbonated, but not too watery.
City Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Pour from a 12oz can. Aroma of dough, berries, some weird medicinal notes.

City Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Poured a light gold with minimal head and lacing. Aroma was the high point here with a slight sweetness with grains/grassy hues. Taste is mix of grains and slight malts with a light hop finish. Palate is decent for a light. Overall, a slightly unusual light but not so different in other ways.
City Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Boring bland beer that is incredibly cheap to buy so that is its one and only selling point. Woudln�t ever buy again
City Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);This beer was pretty terrible. Tasted watery just like any other light beer. THis however didn�t offend anyone by the taste because there was no taste. Basically carbonated water and alcohol. Won�t buy again.
City Light;La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;City Brewery (La Crosse Plant);Delightfully cheap, only ten dollars a case, this light beer has a deep yellowish gold hue with minimal head when poured.

1516 Eegit Red Ale;Vienna, Austria;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;1516 Brewing Company;was much to flat to enjoy and very sour. The worst beer I tried from these guys.
1516 Eegit Red Ale;Vienna, Austria;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;1516 Brewing Company;"(Old BA rate - tap as Irish Red as well) Brighter orangey/red color and poured with a finger of white foamy head. Maltiness shows up first, then a touch of hop bitterness. Nothing overpowering in either department. Light malty sweetness; the hop bitterness definitely shows up in the taste. Very flavorful for what is traditionally a more complex style. Light to almost medium MF, bordering on a little creamy. Not bad drinking at all, balanced brew that could make for a fine session. A little bit heavier for the style, but still nice"
1516 Eegit Red Ale;Vienna, Austria;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;1516 Brewing Company;On draught at the brewpub (as Irish Red). The beer is a dark reddish amber color with a medium thick and foamy beige head that dissipates steadily. Patches of lacing on the glass. Mild malt and fruit in the nose. Medium body with a pale malt and fruit flavor coupled with faintly bitter hops. The finish is sweet caramel malt with a fruity aftertaste. Simple and average overall.
1516 Eegit Red Ale;Vienna, Austria;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;1516 Brewing Company;Draught at the brewpub as 1516 Irish Red. Ruby/red coloured, medium sized off-white head, too much smoke in the brewpub to feel the nose (light floral fruity I suppose). Weak roasted malt, very fruity and mild toffee taste with flowery notes in the finish. Quite sweet and unbalanced beer.
1516 Eegit Red Ale;Vienna, Austria;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;1516 Brewing Company;Draught Fruity sweet aroma. Very dense creamy withe head, beautiful rubin red color. Very strange fruity flavor like cherries, sweetness and a light dry astringent finish. A bit unbalanced, unspectacular beer. 1. Rating Jun 23, 2004 (7/4/6/3/12 Creamy head, nice red/bronze color. Aroma is fruity and sourly. Flavor has much fruity sourness, some roasted malt notes and a decent dry bitterness. Nice, but to much sourness for me.

Gigi Unicbier;G�rouville, Belgium;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Brasserie Gigi de l'Etoile;"(And I have to cheat again with an very old sample. But then, this beer is so hard to get outside its region, that I had to get a forgotten one from the cellar. Unicbier is the only low-alcoholbeer that made it in the T. Webb GBguide for Belgium, as it is a tasty, unique product that has its place amongst Belgium�s classics. It HAD to be in our database.) Very lively carbonation to huge yellow head, fast dwindling; pale orange-amber beer, faint haze. Lots of biscuit-madeirisation in the nose, faint sourish aroma (obvious when young) is still traceable. Slight sweetish-nutty taste with a sourish tang. Bittery-spiciness from the young beer has gone. Still, it has al the character a typical nablab misses. Finish is two seconds citrussy-spiciness, then faint green apples flavour. Very light mouthfeel. The above marks might not seem high. Untill one realises it�s about a 3.2%ABV beer. This might be common for an English draught cask ale, for Belgian standards it�s exceptional. Try it if you see it. And take it home for the kids, to teach them quality beer in homeopathic doses."

Newton Court Cider - Medium Dry (Draught);Leominster, Herefordshire, England;Apple Cider;Newton Court Cider;Leafy and tart appleskins in the musty, lightly farmy aroma. Hazy pale golden-yellow body is very still and quite viscous. Sweet and tart apples blend nicely in the funky, farmy, cheesey flavour with some woody notes. Dessert-like without being overly sweet. Alcohol is never notable but for a light warming sensation. Thick and viscous in the mouth. One of my favourites of the festival. Barrel at GBBF 2005.

Mynediad Ysbyty Perry;Chepstow, Gwent, Wales;Perry;Mynediad Ysbyty Cider;Cask@Catford Beer festival. Apples and cheesy funk, sweetish, with a sour acidic edge, not quite my style, but always a bit of fun to try a true English country cider.
Mynediad Ysbyty Perry;Chepstow, Gwent, Wales;Perry;Mynediad Ysbyty Cider;"From the barrel at Catford Beer Festival. After all the beers I needed, and a cider, time for a perry (about time we had a separate style for that on the site - it�s not really appropriate to enter them as ciders). The first challenge was pronouncing the name (apparently it translates from Welsh as ""hospital entrance"" - not too promising). The second challenge, at such a late stage in the proceedings, was writing my notes. The third, and hardest challenge, is reading them afterwards. Anyway, it was certainly a very pale colour - much like those commercial jobs with ""White"" in the name. Other than that, it was a very palatable and flowery perry that slipped down very easily (which perhaps is not what is needed for a 7% drink after 8 hours at a festival). Good stuff."
Altstadthof Sommerweisse;N�rnberg, Bavaria, Germany;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Hausbrauerei Altstadthof;Draught at Hausbrauerei Altstadthof, Nuremberg, Germany (�4.10/0.4l).

The nose is immediately promising, very pungent yet soft - cloves, light banana, very light lemony sourness. It�s sweet and very, very nice. And the taste... finally doesn�t disappoint - a nice sweetish clove assault ending with on a banana note before falling into dryness.

Americas Whistle Stop Pale Ale;Aurora, Illinois, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Americas Brewpub;Sampled on draught at the 9th annual Prairie Rock Brewfest in Elgin, IL. Sweet aroma with some hops. Nice. Elixir-like. Virtually no head. Reddish amber in color. Very thin, off-white ring of head along edge of glass. More suble than the Carlyle APA I tried just before. Some off notes. Rotates between swillish and drinkable. The hops helps hide some of the off flavors. Bad aftertaste...a little like cough syrup.

Santa Barbara Strawberry Blonde;Santa Barbara, California, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Santa Barbara Brewing Company;Color was like Ive never seen befor, it looked jsut like grapfruit juice with a small white head. Sweet strawberries and a little grain in the nose. Falvor is big stawberry candy, you know like the ones in the red foil made to look like a stawberry and a little wheatieness. Faily sweet, easy to drink, but kind of a one trick pony.

Aftertaste is slightly sweet.
Sly Fox Simcoe IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;If you did not try this, you missed out big time.

Sly Fox Simcoe IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;2006 Draft. (from notes). I had the pleasure of putting this on draft at my house. Poured clear copper in color with a large white extremely sticky head. This one really gummed up my tap valve. Aroma of citrus and piney hops. Taste of sweet piney hops, and citrus. Nice bitterness that follows into the finish. Exudes the trademark Simcoe characteristics without overdoing it which is outstanding.
Sly Fox Simcoe IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Clear copper color, off white foamy head. Aroma was thick prickly hops. Explosively fresh, with lots of citrus and pine. Nose was some sweet malt hidden behind the smoke screen of fresh hop. Taste was full and flavorful malt base, rather thick with layers of fresh hop flavors piled on top. Very resin-y. Mouthfeel was nice, and at 7%, carbonation was perfect. Overall a very hop complex beer, well balanced and very drinkable.

Sly Fox Simcoe IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Poured a clear copper color with a small off-white head. Hop forward aroma of tangerine and citrus. Hoppy tangerine flavor with a decent malty base. Moderately bitter finish.
Sly Fox Simcoe IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;"On draught at Egajdzis� house on 10/5/06. A slight glassiness shows the unfiltered, but well-conditioned nature of the beer. A rosy peach-tangerine body displays a small, but fairly dense, and well-retained white head that laces quite prominently. Very fragrant simcoe hops in the nose show tons of dry-hopping and late-boil additions. It dosent strike me as an overdone, bittered-to-all-hell version and light bits of fluffy, rather succulent honeyish malts can be daintily picked out as well. As it warms and I continue to take it in, the lush simcoes deepen in complexity, lasting on the finish and producing a very green, watermelon and candied orange note that belies the usual hard pine resin and heavily dry grapefruit. There certainly is some light resin, but it is balanced easily by the light sugars and lively fruitiness. Despite having about 5 glasses of this stuff, and kicking Eric�s keg, the aroma never seemed to fail, nor did it get boring, which is strange, as there isn�t all that much going on. Just goes to show, when hops are done right, the wonderful simplicity can make a huge difference. No surprises in the flavor, then, when I find a wonderfully drinkable, highly flavorful, yet tastefully done IPA. Some moderately bitter pine needle-like notes perk up at first, but are quickly washed away by melons, tangerines and a finish reminding me of ruby red grapefruit; no doubt the interplay of the light, but noticeable malt, and the tangy citrus notes from the hops. Excellent texture is provided by a comforting, soft malt body and low, but rather tight carbonation (especially for a draught sample). Nearly creamy, though not as heavy as to be creamy, but certainly frothy and invigorating on the palate, with an immense drinkability. Alcohol is never noted, nor any diacetyl. Hop acids never become a problem, even after the end of 4 or 5 glasses. I could have (and would have) kept drinking it. Not the most complex example, but I don�t think it attempts to be, nor does it seem that it needed to be. Not the sheer tour de force of complexity and powerful flavor that is Mikkeller Simcoe IPA, but wonderful in its own right, and worlds apart from some of the other also-rans in the simcoe IPA category (Weyer dbl Simcoe, stone 10th). Thanks Eric!"
Sly Fox Simcoe IPA;Pottstown and Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Sly Fox Brewing Company;Special gift from Eric and served in my GI IPA glass: Pours a beautiful coppery golden sunset hue topped by a small but lasting frothy head and left okay lace in it�s awake. The nose detects SIMCOE in all of it�s glory of pure pine resin, pink grapefruit, crab apple, white pepper, a touch of clove and mint supported by carmelized and biscuity malt and even a dash of beet sugar. The taste profile starts very hoppy making me happy with citric, acidic and hop spice characteristics at the forefront. Nicely balanced by sweeter malts and a some sugary component. The finish is dry, ashy and astringent but not so much to take away from the flava flav. The mouth feel is mildly aggressive and sharp around the edge and smooth in the midesection with a very long mineral bitter aftertaste. I love these single hopped IPA to show you what the hop is all about, this is no exception. Digging the Simcoe, oh so yummy to my tummy. Mucho THX, now the brewer can get off your ass.

Aroma has a hint of malty sweetness, and a strong citrus/floral hoppy aroma. Medium carbonation. Bubbly, dry mouthfeel, medium-bodied. Light bitterness in the finish, quite smooth. Hoppy punch and a marbley-malty sweet note. Very nice.

Hale's Red Menace Big Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;Bottle. Pours a hazy dark amber color with a moderate off-white head on there. Nose is of stale grass and toasted caramel. Taste is slightly bitter, but has some sweeter and bready malts coming through. Unremarkable for me at all.
Hale's Red Menace Big Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;"12oz bottle, stamped BB 5.22.15. Interesting a 9 ibu amber, so a non hop-centric Amber that isn�t supposed to be an Irish Ale, don�t see too many of those. I guess that would be an English take on an Amber. Also, 4.8 abv, 9 ibu beer that is a ""Big"" Amber, what? Either way, pours a clear orange/copper body, completely clear throughout, must be filtered. Small head but leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is some fruity hops, surprisingly. Looks like its mostly (if not all) super late additions. Then slightly fruit yeast. Has a fruity tropical thang going on but not overly hop-centric or yeast centric. Weird and interesting. Flavor is... surprising. At first, I am all like, what happened. A fruity malt biscuit flavor starts and then abruptly ends. Then a hoppy and de-bittered flavor. Ends light yet slightly stick. I eventually realize this is an Americanized mild with hops but no bitterness. That makes me really appreciate the beer. I like it more than the score I am giving it."
Hale's Red Menace Big Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;On tap at Hale�s, pours a clear copper with a small beige head. Aroma brings out gentle bready malts with a subtle hop component - pretty bland and lifeless though. Flavour is about the same, bringing out bready caramel malts balanced with fruity hops. Not a whole lot to this, but it�s balanced decently enough. Okay, but not my thing.
Hale's Red Menace Big Amber;Seattle, Washington, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Hale's Ales;Draft - Light caramel and pale malts. Clear copper with a decent white head. Light toast malts and caramel with a touch of bitterness. Average.

Climax Hoffmann Helles;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Climax Brewing Company;Draft at craft ale house. Pours clear yellow with minimal white head. The aroma is very light, almost missing. The taste has a light grain. Not bad just boring.
Climax Hoffmann Helles;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Climax Brewing Company;Bottle at home. Pours lightly hazy dark gold with a large, frothy white head, long retention with light lacing. Aroma is light lactic acid, lemon, biscuit malt, earthy hops and paper notes. Flavor is tart fruits, light malt, hops, and bitterness with a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation. So, this is more oxidized Berliner Weisse than Munich Helles. I am not sure what went wrong here.

Climax Hoffmann Helles;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Climax Brewing Company;Light, crisp, smooth. Malt at first with hints of citrus zest and a fairly dry finish. Not bad.
Climax Hoffmann Helles;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Climax Brewing Company;Bottle, but not, er, the freshest, so it probably gets a pass regardless. Nose of sweet citrus and mild grass, but there�s this dominant Jolly Ranchers fruitiness that sticks all over everything else. And a little apple cider. Pours is cloudy yellow with a sudsy bright white head. Taste is sweet but it�s not out of control, a little chalk and dusty coating with the aforementioned green apple, lightly grainy finish and really doesn�t dry out at all. Medium-full body, not particularly clean, hoppiness is light but there. This has very little to do with a German Helles.
Climax Hoffmann Helles;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Climax Brewing Company;I expect something in particular when drinking a Helles beer... This isn�t it. Way to much carbonation. Citrus that seems off style, and it seems out of balance.
Climax Hoffmann Helles;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Climax Brewing Company;Sampled on draft at the House of 1000 beers this beer poured a yellow-gold color with a large creamy white head that lingered and left decent lacing. The aroma was faint, buttery, tangy and had a hint of vague fruits. The flavor was bitter, tangy and buttery with notes of toffee, faint vague fruits and cooked vegetables. Medium length finish of butter, toffee and fruit. Medium body. Disappointing.
Climax Hoffmann Helles;Roselle Park, New Jersey, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Climax Brewing Company;I had high hopes for this due to the rating on here, but I just didn�t care for it.

Crop Circle Beer;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);bottle: brown pour w/ thin tan head. Nutty chocolate, smooth caramel with piney hops and some astringency. hint of licorice. pretty tasty, almost surprisingly.
Crop Circle Beer;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Bottle. Pours an opaque, amber-ruby with a fluffy, beige head. Light aroma of sweet malts, caramel, and brown sugar. Flavor is a tad metallic, but also holds some warm brown sugar. A touch of bitterness - you would probably notice if the hops weren�t there, but as is this is mostly a malt show. Semi-sweet and syrupy in the finish. Medium-light in body, well carbonated. The character shines a bit more as the beer warms. Decent overall.
Crop Circle Beer;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);red-brown pour, off-white head aroma is pretty malty, with some pear and other fruit tastes kind of watered down, there�s some malt and very slight bitterness in the finish, but it�s kinda boring and i do not believe there�s 7% abv in here thin body also, but i guess that complements the lack of flavor
Crop Circle Beer;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Bottle. Pours red with a beige head. Sweet aroma with toasty malt and earthy hoppy notes. The flavor is just a bit boozy, with caramel, toast and just a touch of hops. Pretty good.
Crop Circle Beer;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);Sweet aroma, mainly of caramelized malts, and a definite if small component of alcohol. (I know, the ABV is not high, but I smell it.) Overall, very pleasing. The appearance is amber, of course, with a modest white head. Very attractive. The flavor is roasted malts, caramel, toffee, minor hop contribution. The finish is mainly sweet malts, and is very pleasing as well. Overall, a very respectable beer.
Crop Circle Beer;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);12 oz. bottle. Pours a murky amber with a moderate off-white head that lasted until mid-glass and left partial lace. Very, very light aroma of malt. I really had to get my nose down into the glass to pull anything out of this one. Thankfully, the flavor was more forthcoming with caramel malt up front and some dry hops towards the finish. Very little sweetness to the malt and the hops finish was short-lived. Meh.
Crop Circle Beer;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);bottle from joekinty: pours a dark amber caramel colour with a small off white head. a nice deep malt aroma full of caramel with a decent hop profile to go with it, some dark breads also decent aroma. flavour is very bready with a toffe malt that is a little dirty tasting, some earth hops round out the flavour and make it quit enjoyable not the best amber i have ahd but a good drinker.
Crop Circle Beer;Patchogue, New York, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Blue Point Brewing (AB InBev);12 ounce bottle in a pint glass. Caramel and mild chocolate aroma.

The Tap Kings Slipper;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Creamy, looks great in the glass, rounded and full with nuts and dates much like St Bernardus, aroma broadens at high 50s, a surprising finish laced with anise. A delicious brew -- thanks to the Bros.
The Tap Kings Slipper;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Pours a deep brown/mahogany, with a medium tan head, a small bit of which lasts, leaving sticky sheets of lace. Aroma is sweetish, caramel, and a bit of spice. Falvor starts with some sweetness, caramel and toffee, and ends with a slight bitterness and a good peppery spice. Medium-full bodied, with multiple layers of flavors that really shine as the brew approaches room temp.
The Tap Bootblacks Extra Stout;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Pours a clear dark brown color with no head.

The Tap Bootblacks Extra Stout;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Mildly smokey and fairly roasty aroma. Opaque brown-black with initially decent though short-lived, white, fully diminishing head. Smokey flavour with fair roastiness but salty in the finish. Somewhat sticky in texture though body feels a bit light and watery with low carbonation. Sampled at the brewpub with ClarkVV, MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.

Sample at the brewpub, joined by the locquacious and sagacious ClarkVV. Solid black, little head...roasty nose, bit of tar and smoke...fairly thin body does not well support the roastiness and coffee...very little sweetness, most of it upfront...dry, plain finish with a touch of Concord grape. Major disappointment.
The Tap Bootblacks Extra Stout;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Black, short-lasting beige head. Somehow soapy hops takes you aback coming from a dark beer. Strong dark malts feel not too clean. It is not very sweet at all if this intended to be a foreign stout at all. Smokey, a bit watery, coffe-ish and mostly beany toward the finish. Not very enjoyable at all, one of those beers that has something unenjoyable you just can�t put your finger on. Medium bodied, softly carbonated.
The Tap Bootblacks Extra Stout;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Grapes in dark chocolate roam freely in a slick, tarry body...Steamy roast sticking to anise sweetness, plunging into a dry fade out of flavors...I guess this was a bit too drinkable and slippery for my tastes...
The Tap Bootblacks Extra Stout;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;CO2 draught at The Tap, 3/25/05 with Tiggmtl, MartinT, Muzzlehatch and Rastacouere. Dark black body is opaque and the head is initially about one finger high. Tan and fizzy, it quickly recedes to nothing. Aroma smells strongly of debittered black malt. Quite intense, so much so that the concentrated coffee/roast smell gives off soapy or almost metallic notes. Not much aroma behind the roast. Upon first sip, I�m greatly disappointed by the body, which is watery, to say the least. Notes of cappucino, mocha, light chocolate and slight roasted malt all wash over the palate, and there�s no lack of flavor, but I was expecting some sweet malt flavors, maybe some bananas, caramelized sugar, or something along the lines of, say, Lion Stout or even Coopers. The body denies all possibility of any chewiness or fat malt. Loose and ever thinner, as it warms and breathes, I am getting more of a dry stout, certainly in texture, with the requisite coffee bean and light barley flavors. It�s very drinkable and thirst quenching, being so light of body, and the alcohol is masterfully hidden, but I was looking for something more substantial. Low carbonation, rather lifeless body. 5/3/6/3/11. Nitro draught later the same night. Yikes, this dosent seem well-suited to nitro. The already watery nature of the beer is hugely exacerbated by the thinning nature of the nitrogen. The flavor is dulled and it�s just a watery, thin mess of light coffee and a hint of chocolate. Little, if any, aroma. The light tan head is retained, this time, due to the nitrogen, but that�s about all this has going for it. 4/4/4/2/7
The Tap Bootblacks Extra Stout;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Pours jet black with a big tan head. Taste is big on coffee. Probably the most coffee I�ve tasted in a beer. Well done.
The Tap Bootblacks Extra Stout;Haverhill, Massachusetts, United States;Stout - Extra / Foreign;Haverhill Brewery Inc / The Tap;Pour is pitch black with a large dense brown head which lasts pretty much forever, only receding enough to leave rings of lace as you drink. Aroma is roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and strong coffee, with a bit of leather. Flavor is smooth deep dark chocolate (like cold hot cocoa), roasted coffee beans, and a slight hint of leather. Full bodied, creamy and smooth. At 6.9% this is a dangerously drinkable top notch brew.
Diamond Bear Summer Wheat;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;BOTTLE GASTON RESORT ARK: Lacked the citrus of most summer ales very hard to distinguish from the pale ale..
Diamond Bear Summer Wheat;North Little Rock, Arkansas, United States;Wheat Ale;Diamond Bear Brewing Company;Long lasting fluffy white head as expected. Pale clear gold (since it is filtered). Also since it�s filtered there isn�t much yeast flavor. Very quaffable liight ale with some wheat malt flavor and just a whisper of hops.
Manayunk Dreamin' Double IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;Can pours out golden topped with a white head. Nose is pine needle forward some orange citrus notes and a grain malt. Taste is more of the nice hop combo pine citrus and a well balanced bread malt.

Manayunk Dreamin' Double IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;"Hazy orange and copper coloured body with a thinnish, two centimetre tall off-white head. Aroma of hops, light malt, some alcohol and resin and a good deal of sugars from caster sugar. Medium-bodied; Strong rich flavour of malt, sugar and a touch of hops - not too much there here, though. Aftertaste shows some citrus, grapefruit, resin, pine and a lot of malt - some residual sugars as well, but there isn�t much hops in here, despite the flavours. Overall, a fairly mild Imperial IPA with some decent flavours, but not enough complexity nor sheer flavours. Nice to sample, but with all the other options, this isn�t worth your while or your bucks. I sampled this sixteen ounce can purchased from Gat Beer in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 02-July-2016 for US$4,00 sampled at home in Washington a few hours before leaving back for Philadelphia on 13-October-2016."
Manayunk Dreamin' Double IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;16 ounce can via trade with dandywolffloyd. Thanks! The beer is a hazy gold with a white head of soapy looking foam. The aroma has floral oranges, some orange rind bitterness, and some resinous notes. The taste started out being sweet and sugary, but it really dries out and gets fairly bitter. Medium body and medium carbonation. Sort of slick mouthfeel.
Manayunk Dreamin' Double IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;on tap at the brewpub - pale golden color. Great hop aroma and flavor. A very good double IPA.
Manayunk Dreamin' Double IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;Surprising. Big notes of orange, pine, all within a orange colored brew with two fingers of foam from can. West coast style, dry finish, grapefruit bitter. Strong bitter throughout. Bit of a pallette wrecker.
Manayunk Dreamin' Double IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;This was poured into a tulip. The appearance was a nice looking semi-hazy burnt yellow color with a slim finger�s worth of white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds. Light speckled lacing weaves its way around the glass in a messy sort of way. The smell has a nice blend of sweet pineapple, light mango, a little bit of orange and a slight bitter pine hops. The taste was mainly bitter with a semi-sweet dry citrus effect roaming across my tongue. There�s no aftertaste but has a quick dry citrus finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation comes across fairly well as a DIPA. Biter citrus rind hits my tongue decently. Overall, as a DIPA it works. It�s a little more dry than some other DIPA�s I�ve had. Still good for the most part.
Manayunk Dreamin' Double IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;Sampled from a 12 oz can this beer poured a bright golden color with an enormous foamy tan head that lingered and left good lacing.

Ok.
Manayunk Dreamin' Double IPA;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States;IIPA - Imperial / Double IPA;Manayunk Brewing Company;Pours birhgt orange with a foamy two finger off white head with nice lacing. Aroma is of citrus, tropical fruits, pine, sweet malts, and some light bready malts. Taste is about the same as the aroma.

McMenamins Hopcharmer;Portland, Oregon, United States;IPA;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On tap at the Sunnyside McMenamins. Recently I�ve been very unsatisfied with mcmenamins beer quality, this was definatly better than the last few ive had. Nice strong hopped aroma, kinda citrusy hop smell. Poured a hazy orange with a nice white head that left moderate lacing on the glass. Taste was sweet at first with a slightly bitter end, good balance but still lacked the strong hop flavor i like in IPAs. Kinda thin mouthfeel and ended rather dry, good brew but nothing to rave about.
McMenamins Avatar;Portland, Oregon, United States;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;McMenamins Pubs and Breweries;On nitro tap at the sunnyside mcmenamins. Pours a nice light orange color with a nice silky smooth white head from the nitro tap. Very smooth and creamy texture to this brew. Aroma was very fruity with a slight hop backing. Taste followed the smell pretty closely with a strong fruity presence, maybe raspberries? Rather light and refreshing but could have had the fruit toned down a bit to make a better golden.

PALATE: medium light body, not very robust but balanced, relatively easy on the palate OVERALL: a basic pils, in the mold of your standard euro lagers, pretty simple but very drinkable. better than cheap lagers because of the easiness with a touch of extra flavor and substance. Similar to Becks or Heineken, but dryer.

Sweet, but with some fruitiness to compensate. You can�t notice the 7,5% ABV at all. Dangerously delicious beer, although by no means a classic.
Gale's;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask conditioned at The Saye & Sele Arms, Broughton, Oxon. Golden brownish colour with short lasting head. Low flavoured, low impact boys bitter, no more than a standard session bitter but without much interest. A sweet fruity hoppiness, but not enough.

Gale's;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask at Wetherspoons, Ashford, Kent. Golden brown, grassy hoppy nose, nice hoppy flavour with plenty of flowery/herby flavours. Dry fizzy palate. Hops dominate throughout, with dry, tangy finish. White head that lasts well. Light acids Good session beer.
Gale's;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);"This beer is now pretty much marketed under the minimalist style ""Gales""; you�ll have to look pretty closely at the pump clip to see the miniscule words ""Best Bitter"" at the bottom. And whilst it might be styled Best Bitter, it�s really a fairly standard ordinary session bitter. But I don�t mean that as a criticism. Gales seem to have realised that their long usual fruity, sweetish house style doesn�t suit all palates and have injected much more hop bitterness into this brew. Once I tended to find Gales beers a bit cloying for a session, but I could down a few pints of this one with no problem. Nothing really stands out; it�s just a jolly decent session bitter. Which is nice. Cask (handpump), The Wykeham Arms, Winchester."
Gale's;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Hand pulled at the Anchor, Birmingham. Light Bitter, but a nice flavour. Orange with a fluffy head.

Gale's;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Frog & Toad, Gillingham. Mmm. Lovely drop in excellent condition. Soft and fruity. Orange jam. Some demerara sugar. Citric tang. Stands up well throughout the pint. An excellent modern best bitter. Some tea tannin in aroma and late in the finish. The Gales brewery has really impressed me this year.
Gale's;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);Cask. Golden with thin white head. Sweetish maltly beer with a slight apple flavour with hoppy bitter finish. Not bad but not that exciting, could do with more hop flavour for my taste.

John Harvard's ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Firkin version at Barley�s 6th Annual Mini RAF (04/26/08): The beer is a mostly clear dark amber color with a medium thin beige head that dissipates steadily.

John Harvard's ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Sampled on draft at the Monroeville PA location this beer poured a light ruby-mahogany color with a small khaki head.

John Harvard's ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);"I had this on tap in Manchester, CT. It was dubbed ""EKG ESB"". I will rate it here. EKG stands for East Kent GOldings, which they used primarily in this. Quite a mild aroma with slight fruitiness and maybe a touch of citrus. This is very faint and not aromatic at all. Transparent copper/amber color with a light tan head. Fruity, vinous start with raisins and cherry notes. Mildly astringent. Finishes with caramel notes and lots of floral hops--this floralness is present in most of the JH�s beers in Manchester."
John Harvard's ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Pours copper, with aroma of malt, caramel, hops. Tastes malty, with some hops, almonds, caramel, and earthiness at the finish. I felt that the hop presence added to the profile here, but I guess they imparted a more IPAishness than an ESBishness. Still, a good beer regardless.
John Harvard's ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);Not a bad ESB but nothing really to write home about, the hoppiness may have been a little too much for the style, the back end of the flavors & body were really bitter & spicy, deep copper color, decent bubbly white head, nice lacing, good malt profile with hints of nuts & caramel, smooth & drinkable, excellent session beer
John Harvard's ESB;Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;John Harvard's Brewhouse (Corporate Office);I am assuming that this is the ESB I had at the John Harvard's in NY. It was pretty drinkable, although there were more malts than hops in the flavor, and it was disappointingly not very bitter at all. More like a cross between a bock and a dry Scottish ale or Brown ale. Thin body. The finish is decent and smooth.
Valley Forge Lincoln Lager;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Deep auburn-gold. Nose sweet, a bit of lemon and sweet malts. Great flavor, lots of caramel malts with some cookie. Something akin to cinnamon for a spicy zip. Creamy and sticky, nice hoppy finish. Strong caramel character made me think this was a Vienna and I complimented the brewer on it. He said he was going for a marzen, so I probably insulted him in some way. Still good stuff.
Valley Forge Lincoln Lager;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valley Forge Brewing Co;On tap. Poured a light orange in color with a white head. Malts in the aroma and taste with some hops. I�m not crazy about the Pale Lager style of beer and this beer reminded me why (too light in the taste, body, aroma, etc.).
Valley Forge Lincoln Lager;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Valley Forge Brewing Co;I found this one to be very interesting.

Valley Forge Liams Choice Irish Stout;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;Stout;Valley Forge Brewing Co;VFBC knows how to make some stouts, although the name is a bit misleading in a way, I was kind of expecting to get something like a Guinness or Murphy�s but this had more body & flavor, it was much heavier than the other two, black in color, generous tan head, great lacing around the glass, nose full of chocolate & coffee, full body, very smooth & very drinkable, flavors included dark roasted coffee & dark chocolate, nice hop profile to balance the beer really well, this one�s a keeper
Valley Forge Nathalies IPA;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Valley Forge Brewing Co;Had this over the weekend before they ran out. Poured copper, with aroma of hops, malt, citrus. Tastes hoppy, with malt, citrus, and some fruitiness in the finish.
Valley Forge Nathalies IPA;Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, United States;IPA;Valley Forge Brewing Co;A bit disappointing, VFBC�s Red Coat is hoppier than this was, copper in color, decent amount of off-white head, nice lacing, the hops just weren�t there, they went missing, maltiness was a bit on the light side, this beer was just too light & lacking, it�s missing quite a bit, the brewer named this beer for his new wife, I hope she�s not pissed

Three Floyds Alpha Naught (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;Perfect addition of woody character to just slightly tame the amazing hoppy character. Added a new dimension of caramel, vanilla and a touch of smoke. Soft nose for such a high amount of IBUs.
Three Floyds Alpha Naught (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;FOBAB 2004: Spicey nose. Some vegetable flavors as well. Mostly dominated by the ever present hops. Slight alcohol burn at the end. Really sticks to the palate. Crazy hop flavors. What you�d expect from FFF.
Three Floyds Alpha Naught (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;FOBAB 2004: (It was spelled Alphanaut in the program.) Tasted much like the great Dreadnaught, but the oak aging seemed to blunt the bitterness, but not the flavor, of the hops somewhat. Plenty of piney hopping, a bit of grapefruit and a small reminder that there�s some malt in there. This drank real smoothly... so I sampled it a couple of times.

Three Floyds Alpha Naught (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;hoppy as can be, had this at the aged festival in chicago and enjoyed it even with the enormous head that came along with it. was hoptacular and little else, but definitly amazing on all edges. piney, citrusy, woody, with some caramel, vanilla mixed in with it all.

Three Floyds Alpha Naught (2004);Munster, Indiana, United States;Strong Ale - American;Three Floyds Brewing Company;This one looks like a brown ale and a strong ale had a ticked off love child. Typical appealing Floyds aroma and a thin to no head. About 200 IBUs I hear and it does seem like it. Hard bite that is enjoyable for hops lovers. Strong alcohol taste as well. Great if you like the strong stuff.
Indian Wells Lobotomy Bock;Inyokern, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Indian Wells Brewing;Bottle. Pours dark brown with a very large, foamy beige head. Malty aroma. Taste of malt and...I dunno. Pretty bland for a bock. Perhaps a bit of stone fruit. Alcohol. Not worth a buy, unless you need the tick.
Indian Wells Lobotomy Bock;Inyokern, California, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Indian Wells Brewing;From bottle to pint. The aroma is rather rich with biscuit male, which was a promising start, but there is also a bit of funk in the end. Garnet and brown with brown head that quickly fades to a thin collar. Taste is thin and not much malt at all. Blah.

Malt aroma, of brown sugar, a bit of roastiness. Taste is crisp and highly carbonated, of toasted malt mainly and some yeast. Hides the alcohol completely. Lingering crispness without much flavor.

Trinity Red Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);"Tasted from bottle into standard pint glass. Brewed for Trader Joe�s by Goose Island in Chicago; I�ve read it�s essentially the same as their seasonal Irish Red Ale. If true, it�s no wonder Trinity is one of TJ�s very best ""cheap beers."" Pours a clear, bubbly red color with medium beige head. Aromas of bread, roasted barley and just a hint of hops. Complex malty-sweet taste balanced by hops bitterness and dryness of unmalted grain. Light-body but with a full, round mouthfeel. Nice fruity ale fermentation. Extremely drinkable, the six-pack never lasts long."

Trinity Red Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Hazy grapefruit-amber color with a white head. Non-descript malt aroma with some cardboard notes. However, non-descript aroma contrasts with a lovely honeyed-malt flavor that leaps out. Smooth, mellifluous red ale, moderately fruity with a honeyed finish. What a bargain!
Trinity Red Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);Bottle split with maniac. Pours a hazy golden amber with large white head and sticky lacing. Vegetal, swet, herbal, fake bubblegum on the tail. I think this bottle must be old. Could be alright fresh I suppose.
Trinity Red Ale;Monrovia, California, United States;Red Ale - Irish;Trader Joe's (Steinhaus Brewing / JosephsBrau);12oz bottle. Amber-brown color with a respectable, creamy head. Spicy, sugary, rich amber malt tones. Medium bodied, with some smooth vanilla-amber malt sweetness that fades away in the watery aftertaste. Lacking a little depth in the body department, it is hard to think of this beer as anything but session schwag. That being said, it is relatively clean, fresh, and inoffensive. Unimpressive.

A nice session beer for a good price.

Altenm�nster Premium Bavarian Beer;Kempten, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Allg�uer Brauhaus (Radeberger Gruppe);It�s very smooth and the balance between barley and hop is remarkable both about the aroma than the taste. It�s so good looking with it�s huge persistent head and its so clean blonde colour. I don�t really understand those who don�t like it...guys, it�s a pils, it�s not supposed to have the same features of an ale!

Slaghmuylder Paasbier;Ninove, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Slaghmuylder;Converting ticks to ratings. Had this early 2000's, at Caf� Gollem. Slightly spicy golden ale from what I remember, I see it's listed as a Pale Lager here. Well, wasn't really impressed with this.
Slaghmuylder Paasbier;Ninove, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Slaghmuylder;One of Slaghmuylder�s charmingly old-fashioned beers, from a time when pale lager conquered Belgium. In fact, this was the first Belgian Easter beer ever, and remained the only Belgian Easter lager since. Very much like Slaghmuylder�s Kerstbier, but the sample I tasted, was unfiltered and had more yeasty notes because of that. And like the Kerstbier, I regard this as one of the better Belgian lagers.
Slaghmuylder Paasbier;Ninove, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Slaghmuylder;Zythos 2008. Poured blond with a thick white head. Very floral aroma, Very smooth medium mouthfeel, flavour of sweet lemon with sour spicy hints and a dry refreshing aftertaste.
Slaghmuylder Paasbier;Ninove, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Slaghmuylder;Tasted at the 2007 Zythos fest. Light blonde, this beer is classed as a Czech Pilsner on BA, which I suppose isn�t far wrong. A slight hazy body under a thin white head. Yeast and some malt flavours can be detected in the aroma, but no overpowering smell. Clean, even though cloudy in appearance and fairly crisp, a bit sweet and yeasty. Hops and yeast aftertaste. I would have another.
Slaghmuylder Paasbier;Ninove, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Slaghmuylder;Blonde with a nice white head. Aroma of flowers (chamomile) and sweet taste, with a bit of flowers and herbs aftertaste.
Slaghmuylder Paasbier;Ninove, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Slaghmuylder;On draft at Heeren van Liedekerke Aroma of vinegar and sour apples. Flavor has some slight caramel notes but again is quite sour. You could explain this flavors by saying that my palate is completely wasted by previous beers but that wasn�t the case. Only other explanation, and definetly after knowing what style it is (or should be), is an infection... . Flavor was at least more tasty then most Pale lagers.. .
Slaghmuylder Paasbier;Ninove, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Slaghmuylder;Draft at De Heeren van Liedekercke. Hazy dark pink color, off white head. Aroma of plums, raisins, cherries, green apples. Taste is sour applesauce and red plums. Definitley not a pale lager, but also not an Easter beer. Tasty anyway, regardless of what it is.
Slaghmuylder Paasbier;Ninove, Belgium;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Brouwerij Slaghmuylder;12/11/2010 - 33cl bottle @ home Cloudy yellow to ocher coloured beer, white thick head with big bubbles in it. Aroma: quinces (yes!), yeast, fruity, bready, rotten fruit. MF: ok carbon, medium body, bit watery texture. Taste: citrus fruits, quinces, a little malt. Very unpleasant tart finish and hops. This beer is a bit off, or at least I hope so. Calls for a re-rating. Best before dates seems to be expired 6 months (thank you beer shop!).

The aroma is a tiny bit sour and fruity.

Diamond Knot Industrial ESB;Mukilteo, Washington, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Diamond Knot Brewery;"The best beer (perhaps other than the DK IPA) offered at the �05 April Brew�s Day in Bellingham. Very musky aroma - smoked oak, aged cheese quality, bourbon, some darker hops and pine. Some grassiness, but not freshly cut grass, rather like grass that has been sitting in the yard a while, surprisingly this is a good quality giving the beer a chewy musky character (Martha Stewart: ""it�s a good thing""). The flavor is more crisp - more hops, but maintains the dark quality from the aroma, preceding a floral finish. This is a great ESB, but could use a bit of rounding-out and aging. This almost seems like a Dunkel to me."

Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;Totally bizarre lavender beer with thick, moussy, sticky head coloured a deep lilac. The colour of the beer itself is that of a kirr, a kind of orangey pink with purplish hue, clear but darker and hazy after adding the deposit. The aroma is just as weird: lavender soap, shampoo, supported by hints of honey, cloves, gingerbread, lilacs, vanilla, rosewater and lime. Subtle honey in the taste, bit watery onset, fresh fruit sourishness reminiscent of lime, delicate and not sticky, light on the tongue with a lean mouthfeel, very lightly malty, and in the finish it becomes weird again: a strong lavender shampoo perfume with retronasal gingerbread trying to fight off a mild herbal hoppiness which does not succeed in providing bitterness - fortunately, as this would not fit in the concept. Call it a guilty pleasure if you will, but I liked this a lot. Too bad the brewery has stopped meanwhile.
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;33cl, recently out of business, exclusive brewery, brew with lavender, last tasted one year ago from the brewery, heavy, not balanced brew, hazy greypurple! colour, small head, nothing special, but very original brew!
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;Bottled, thanks Bj�rn! It�s looks like a homebrew brewed by Homer Simpson at the power-plant, sickly grayish green-turquoise with a greyish white creamy head. Very spicy aroma of anise-seeds, mint, ginger, lavender in the surprisingly well-constructed and well-blended aroma. medium-bodied with smooth flavours of licorice, lavender, yeast and mint. Herbal yeasty finish with touches of anise. Gimmicky colour but the beer itself was surprisingly well-balanced despite it�s unorthodox flavours.
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;(Bottled) Clear, very strange dark violet color with a smallish, tight and pink-blue head. Mild, very neutral aroma with some blueberries. Blueberry continues in the flavor, with some sugar and licorice-like, but yet unidentified substances. Cannot find the honey here. Light to medium-bodied, smooth-carbonated palate. This is some strange stuff...
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;Bottle 0,33: Strange brew with a green-blond colour and a lavender aroma also honey in it and by suprise purple-red yeast. Really a strange brew but its great.
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;Bottled. Looks like some bizarre chemical experiment: Murky turquise green with pale green head. Evident herbal lavender aroma. Sweet with light-medium body and soft mouthfeel. Spicy lavender flavour dominates, sweet malt support it. No bitterness. Besides being the ugliest beer on earth it�s actually pretty good.
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;Bottled. first thought was WTF?!? green? Colour is dark absinthe green. head is mediumsized and white. Pouring in the yeast leads to red dots in the white head. Totally weird and osbscure. Aroma is a lot of herbs, ginger, some yeast and citrus. Flavour is ginger, slight juniper, fruits and yeast. Very herbal aftertaste. Oh man what a weird thing. Very refreshing.
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;Bottled Ok .. this is strangest beer I have ever _seen_. Unclear green color, creamy head and ... red yeast. Very spicey aroma - mainly ginger. Beer itself is not so special - it has also a bit ginger in the flavor, but mainly sweetish notes, very light hops and papery malty flavors. Light spicey aftertaste. Beer for wackos.
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;Greenish blonde, cloudy. Ginger, honey and citrus in the aroma. Sweet flavor with lavender, honey and citrus. Sticky palate, otherwise not too bad.
Kool Mortal;Jamagne, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brasserie Mortals Beers;OK, so I like experimental brews, and sweet beers, and bizarre flavors! I�m way out of step with most raters on this, but hey, I like a rotation of Thai, rockabilly, ska and opera music as well!! I first tried this May 31, driving between Kerkom and Dupont breweries. I noted that it�s got lavender and honey, and I�d say a lovely balance of spice, blueberries, honey, lavender, and malt. Fun and not too sweet, and not sour. It was purple, and perhaps the recipe has changed over time as some earlier reviews call it more green. On June 2 at the Delerium Cafe I bought all the available Mortal brews (most are way funky and too sweet) and again found it to have a rich body, nice lavender and honey flavors...a fun beer...Wahoo!!

Alley Kat Chat-O Oatmeal Stout;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Alley Kat Brewing Company;341mL bottle is an exclusive beer of Chateau Louis Hotel in Edmonton. It poured a brown color with light beige head and little lacing. Aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is lightly sweet with some hop bitterness in the finish. There is a nice carbonation, but the body is a little on the thin side for a stout, and if not for this I would have rated higher.
Alley Kat Chat-O Oatmeal Stout;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Alley Kat Brewing Company;"My god this is barely a stout, Yet another example of Alley Kat doing a crapy custom beer. Chat O has a reddish brown hue that lets light penetrate very easily with no head at all. The smell is the only part of this beer that is enjoyable; it had the smell of cookie doe, with milk chocolate and vanilla high lights very desert like. The flavor is non-existent, I had to try real hard to get any kind of taste out of it, and what could be detected was of weak coffee and burnt chocolate. This was very disappointing with no complexities to it, but really since it had no flavor it couldn�t taste bad. Don�t waist your time or money on this one."""
Alley Kat Chat-O Oatmeal Stout;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Review from March 2006 Crap. You live in Edmonton? Don�t bother. I personally think as of about 2 years prior to the date of this review that this beer had possibly went bad, and now, possibly just being sold to clear out their warehouse because it�s obvious that no one would purchace this knowingly twice. Reminds me of Hakim Stout, which was also quite putrid and undrinkable. I grimmaced at the smell as well as every chug. It�s only redeemeing quality is that it tastes like coaco puffs - which should not exist in beer form.......and molassess. I feel pain - very harsh. Mouthfeel is along the lines of cotton. Tates like juice your mom made when you were young camping with 2 times the acceptable ammount of water. Tongue was cold - either from the beer being cold or the fact that the taste buds all rejected further abuse. Sour. Gets worse. If you have to try this, taste once and huck out the window from well above the pavement. Very low quality. How this company can put out quality beer or brutal beer with no inbetween is a mystery.

Alley Kat Chat-O Oatmeal Stout;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Alley Kat Brewing Company;341ml brown bottle. Deep brown colour, not opaque, reddish brown highlights. Head is barely there, it is a thin fine layer of off white bubbles on the surface. Aroma is light roasted malts, hints of cocoa, a little coffee. Flavour has some dark chocolate, quick sweetness, moderate roasted malt character. Finishes dry, with watery black coffee note. Fine prickly carbonation with a medium body, slick mouthfeel.
Alley Kat Chat-O Oatmeal Stout;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Dark like cola, and just about as fizzy-- okay, not quite THAT fizzy! Earthy and roasty, full-flavoured but a little on the thin side with a dry finish. Very good, but a fuller mouth feel and less carbonation would make it even better.
Alley Kat Chat-O Oatmeal Stout;Edmonton, Alberta, Canada;Stout;Alley Kat Brewing Company;Punny name if pronounced right considering who it is brewed for. Very dark without much head.

River Market Irresistible Parrothead Ale (IPA);Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;River Market Brewing Company;This IPA is smoking good, if you like a really fruit centric up front hoppy IPA. Lighter than should be maltiness, but still enough to give it some sweetness and body. This is very easy to drink and refreshing.
River Market Irresistible Parrothead Ale (IPA);Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;River Market Brewing Company;Really good I.P.A. Surprising, considering how the others weren�t so good. Clear appearance, nice hoppiness and aroma. Almost perfect bitterness. I wished they had some to go.
River Market Irresistible Parrothead Ale (IPA);Kansas City, Missouri, United States;IPA;River Market Brewing Company;"Citric, hoppy aroma, fruity and light, primarily featuring hints of grapefruit and lemon with a very small amount of countering toasty, honeyish malt sweetness. Pale amber color with golden highlights, semi-opaque, fairly slight head. Flavor is also lightly fruity and hoppy, not so much malt to be found here, but not a lot of hop complexity or flavor either, just a light amount of refreshing lemony bitterness. Light-medium bodied, palate is soft and a bit watery, light-moderate bitterness overall. This might make a good ""beginner�s IPA""; comparable to something like Redhook."
Du Brabant La Cuv�e Nico;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Bottle, thnx to Fred ! Pours clear blonde, with a bit of an amber glow. Good white head, which is rather stable as well ( still, after what, 13 years ? ) Smell is heavy, thick, sweet, bit madeira. Taste is sweet, madeira, oxidation, some malty notes are left, very hidden under the previously named aspects. it has a very, very mild bitter touch left towards the back. Underneath it all, it also has some complexity and depth left, from what I imagine must have been a very good malt-selection. At this point, it will surely devide people. Many might say it�s over the top, because it is very oxidized. Some others - like myself - like this type of aged beers every once in a while. I think it held up great, for a non-sour blonde beer at this age. The carbonation feels perfect, as well as the body, where usually , after 10 or more years, carbonation starts to fade, and the body starts to decline. So yeah, at this specific point in time, this particular bottle was a well-tasting treat to me :) thnx Fred !
Du Brabant La Cuv�e Nico;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Occasional beer named after the brewer�s son I think, tasted at one of the Leuvense Biertherapeuten�s beer festivals many years ago, before this brewery ceased activities and then, recently, restarted them. From old notes: snow white, stable, creamy head leaving pretty lacing, hazy yellow blonde colour. Sweetish, apple, citrussy, rounded palate with sourish touch, spicy yeastiness and dry spicy and hoppy, long finish. Quite enjoyable, though I liked La Braban�onne Ambr�e more, not counting the new generation Brabant beers, of course.
Du Brabant La Cuv�e Nico;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Bottled. Pours Golden with a white head. Aroma is spicy lemon. Taste is sweet spicy, with a litle fruit
Du Brabant La Cuv�e Nico;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Hazy golden colour with a white head. Spicy citrus light alcoholic aroma and a sweet dry citrus light bitter taste. Medium body and a dry finish.
Du Brabant La Cuv�e Nico;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;"Yellow-gold, slight (cold) haze; lemon-yellow tinted white head, good carbonation. Vanilla, citrus and alcohol in the nose, smells strong & dry. Bone-dry beer, traces of white candi sugar, citrus. Bitterish citruspeel retronasal. After a certain time and some warming up, at last some restsugars, blending with the alcohol. Enormous dry-out effect, not light bodied by any standard despite high attenuation. Alcohol obvious. Not terribly super-strong, but giving the impression of. remarkably more run-of-the-mill beer than the other two tasted - but technically irreproachable."
Du Brabant L Abbaye Zitti;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Tripel;Brasserie du Brabant;Clear orange-golden beer, very carbonated, slight gushing to a luxurious, very creamy orange tinted head. Fresh, citrussy, lemony farmyard smells, including lemonbalm, clover, cypress - and even hops, lol. Nose to die for. Very roasted flavours, caramel, roasted malts. Sweetness is initially high, but then gets tempered by both light bitter and even lighter acidic spicey notes - multitude of herbs and spices: citrus, carrots, mustardseed, ginger,... anything. Dry, very dry mouthfeel, medium to well bodied. The soft sweetness of every new sip gets obliterated slowly, gradually by and ever drier, spicier softer bitterness. This beer is GENIUS - superbly balanced, and absolutely, insanely good for a new brewery. If, as their website says, this L� Abbaye Zitti is not any longer brewed, then they should rebrew it immediately.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Blonde au Miel;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Thnx to Fred ! Pours clear blonde, small white head. Smell is Honey ( like mead ) , bit bitter, soome Madeira. Taste is bit metallic, slightly Dusty Madeira, some very Nice maltyness. Some Honey as well. Nicely carbonated still, i guess this was overcarbonated when fresh , but now its perfect. A bit sweet of courde. Very impressive !
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Blonde au Miel;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Continuing to clear some of my EuroLog. Hazy golden colored pour. Big white head. Plenty of lacing. Nose is slight honey notes and malt. Taste is a dry sweet honey note.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Blonde au Miel;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Delirium Cafe Hazy pale golden ale with a large and rather dense white head that leaves no lacing. Citrusy, honeyed, almondy nose. A growing sourness is the main feature of the flavour profile that shows its honey highly attenuated. Dry and sour through and through with a generally spicy yeastiness accompanying the taster until the very end. Long floral and mineral finish with moderate bitterness. A well executed brew that I would probably prefer if 2% lighter, but it sure drinks easily for 2%.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Blonde au Miel;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Golden color. Honey aroma and flavor with a touch of mandarin. A bit alcoholic, but well balanced, not even a bit of sweetness, so very well attenuated. Very light bitter aftertaste.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Blonde au Miel;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;(Bottled, 0.75l) Opaque golden color with smallish head. Slightly sour, honeyish aroma with some strange, toilet-freshener-compost hints. Sweetish honey flavor. Medium-bodied, quite thick, low-carbonated palate. A quite decent brew, but the aroma was not so pleasant.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Blonde au Miel;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;"Quite hazy (like very fine yeast in suspension), very pale yellow (as pineapple juice) beer; huge, light-yellow head, creamy in consistency, quite stable and leaving some lace. Spring flowers nose, honey, spicey - couldn�t be more Walloon farmyard nose. Bit of citrus as well. Surprisingly bitter taste, more spicey bitterness than hoppy, even a tad harsh. Again flowery-spicey. Honey might leave some flavour, but absolutely no sweetness. Finish betrays slight acidity. Not really light bodied. This beer seems extremely well-attenuated, but the malts/honey left some imprint! A surprising, and interesting brew. I�ve seldom had such a well attenuated honeybeer. I fear, however, that the used hops are very British-Belgian, meaning not very noble. if they could better this, it would become really great. BTW, if all commercial descriptions would be that accurate!"
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Brune Sp�ciale;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Bottle @ Delirium, Brussels. Pours deep amber brown with a small, creamy beige head. Wonderful aroma of spice, coriander, cinnamon, cherries, nougat, molasses and caramel. Light vinious as well. Medium carbonation, sadly a bit too thin for its own good. Mild flavour, light caramel, red currants, red apples, mild molasses. Very dry and fairly bitter in the finish. Very good, just sad that the flavour feels like a let-down after smelling the aroma.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Brune Sp�ciale;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;(Bottle 75 cl) Very dark amber - close to being brown actually. Hazy with a delicious beige head. The brewmaster was a bit reluctant about selling this because he said it had a bit too much carbonation. And though it is helping itself out of the bottle it�s far from being a shooter like for instance the Blaugies range. Sourish, spicy nose. Incredibly complex and spicy flavours (no wonder with eight different malts...). Lovely aroma hops in the finish. Very dry, tart and quenching. 310505

Enjoyed together with tderoeck, Benzai & Alengrin. 2005 Vintage. Hazy amber, little head. Nose is sweet cardboard, oxidation, vintage honey notes. Taste is thin sugar, oxidation, vintage honey, thin malts, leaves & overripe fruits. Body is heavily thinned out by age. This is just far too old.

Hmm ok beer.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Ambr�e Sp�ciale;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;The Brasserie du Brabant, one of the few breweries in the province of Wallonian Brabant, apparently stopped brewing now, so fortunately I went there some years ago to buy a few bottles of this - the brewer handed me a few labels separately, which I had to attach to the bottles myself after getting home... Cream white, dense, sticky, stable head, deep reddish amber colour, hazy, warm. Lots of nutty and caramelly malts, red berries, unripe pear, peach, floral hops, cognac, old cheese, bark, honey and a jute- and barnyard-like hint reminiscent of Orval or some saisons. Restrained fruitiness, crisp with strong carbonation, vague candi-ish sweetness, strong walnut-like maltiness, lightly oily mouthfeel, peppery hops in the finish. Perhaps not the most refined ale, but very honest and appetizing nonetheless - yet hardly a foreshadowing of the new adventures this brewery would embark upon years later...
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Ambr�e Sp�ciale;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;Bottled. Slightly hazy amber coloured. Fruity aroma with some funky and spicy notes. The same in the flavour plus a lot of hops. Quite bitter and dry finish. Interesting and complex.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Ambr�e Sp�ciale;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;75 cl bottle, 9% ABV, label reads Ambree, but not Speciale. Deep amber with a good off-white head. Nose is chocolatey and spicey. Chocolate flavours with good hoppy bitterness throughout, a lot of fruit and hint of spices. Warming alcohol, long chocolate aftertaste that is quite dry. Full-bodied. Worthy of its pompous name.
Du Brabant La Braban�onne Ambr�e Sp�ciale;Genappe - Baisy-Thy, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Strong Pale;Brasserie du Brabant;(Bottle 75 cl) I know the brewery�s website claims this to be 7,5% ABV but the label says 9,0% ABV - don�t know which to believe. Beautiful deep amber colour with a small off-white head. Light caramel flavours, some malt and a rather dry, short, hoppy finish. So far the least refined and least interesting Brabant beer. Slightly disappointing actually. 310505
Bethlehem Brew Works Mirabella;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Fegley's Brew Works;Mirabelle 04 Reserve-on tap-pours a white head and opaque brownish yellow color like an unfiltered apple cider. Aroma is fruity-lemon, vinegar. Taste is fermented fruit-apple cider/lemon, vinegar, musty wheat. Vinuous tannins and dryness in the finish. Occasional. OK effervescence. OK, description says Belgian Oud Bruit made with plums.
Bethlehem Brew Works Mirabella;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Fegley's Brew Works;"Thickly clouded pale yellow color with a fairly tall and bright white fizzy foamed head. Singes down quickly to a firm frothy collar and mininal webs of lacing. Aroma is quite sweet without any real sugar accents, mostly citric in a way, fruity for sure but undistinguishable by trait. Tropical and sour; plum I guess could be evident but doesn�t seem like any plum I know of. A bit more like a wine or even a cider type drink. Lightly bready and some yeasty factors help wrinkle the fabric of fruityness. Taste is nice, kinda crisp and sharp but not so much so that its taking away from the feel and/or character. Which is also quite nice, with a light fluffy almost creamed fizzy texture. Again, a bit cider-like. Tart-like, flowery, bready, the plum is just a hinting factor over the malty fruits and wheaty structure. Smooth overall and fluffy, a smallish hint of yeasty souring mixes with the fruity tinge quite well. There�s nothing to over the top with this lambic. Its very moderate with its juices and tame in its approach of tart and sour. Nice calming dryness fades off the end with touches of yeast funk. A nice little treat to enjoy with friends and neighbors."
Bethlehem Brew Works Mirabella;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Fegley's Brew Works;Cloudy pink color, very little head, some lacing around the glass, sour nose with some fruity notes, more fruits in the flavors including lemon & orange, very smooth & drinkable lambic, a bit of a white wine type of finish, well done for a lambic made by an American brewer

Bethlehem Brew Works Mirabella;Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States;Lambic - Fruited;Fegley's Brew Works;Poured a cloudy pinkish color with a small white head, which eventually diminished to a ring around the edges. Funky sour, light horseblanket, and dark fruits in the aroma. Acidic, tart plum, and lemon in the taste, with some mild carbonation. This was not a bad lambic, especially considering it was made in the US. Could have been a little more over the top, but I am not complaining.

Weiss-R�ssl Pilsener;Rossstadt, Bavaria, Germany;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Weiss-R�ssl-Br�u (Arcobr�u);Draft at Landgasthof Schramm across from the brewery in Rossstadt. Clear gold with a lasting white head. Aroma is malty with notes of toasted grain and hay and raw husks, aroma hops are quietly herbal and spicy and there�s a subtle soapy off-note that I thought at first could be the tap, but after it warms it shows more as DMS (carrot, turnip, concrete). Medium body is rich and filling, malt is off-dry and toasty, caramelized with an almost-burnt pancake batter note, and it�s also just a tad husky as well. Low sweetness and rich savoriness play with medium-low hop finishing bitterness and faint but still unpleasant acid. Almost a really splendid Hell (not quite a Pils with the low hop presence), tastes and feels better than it smells (that soap note in the nose...), if only the huskiness and over-caramelization were addressed it could be an easy drinker.

Feral Swan Valley Stout;Baskerville, Australia;Stout;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);Tried this about 2003? It was the most flavoursome beer I�ve had. Chocolate coffee flavour which is well balanced.
Feral Swan Valley Stout;Baskerville, Australia;Stout;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);The stout I had was 6.8% alcohol, and was terrific. Chestnut brown, opaque with darkly roasted malt, mild char, and faint apple aromas. Flavours of chocolate, coffee, and apple-raisin deliver sweetness up front with a nicely rounded bitter finish. Heavy mouthfeel. Excellent all around!
Feral Swan Valley Stout;Baskerville, Australia;Stout;Feral Brewing Co. (Coca-Cola Amatil);The appearance of this beer was quite good, it had a nice dark tan head that foamed well from the tap but didn�t last the distance. Solid black body and good lacing. Found the aroma to be dry grainy malt. Taste was nice and smooth, initially there was a touch of brown sugar sweetness, but pretty soon there was a strong roasted coffee flavour with a hint of liquorice and milk. The mouthfeel was nice and thick with good bitterness increasing more as you get to the end of the glass. This is the new and improved version from last year and well worth the wait! But I like my stouts!
Mistys Stonehenge Orange Wheat;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mistys Steakhouse & Brewery;on tap-pours hazy yellow with a white head. Aroma is orange. Taste is orange zest, grassy hops, wheat/light malt.
Mistys Stonehenge Orange Wheat;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mistys Steakhouse & Brewery;Had on tap at Misty�s downtown on 9/26/08. Pours a clear, fizzy golden color with no head. Very mild aroma, with just hints of citrus. Flavor is moderate orange flavor--and not much else. Palate is thin and overly carbonated. It�s a decent beer and, if they sold it in bottles, would be a good lawnmower beer. But not really the best choice to go with Misty�s top-notch steaks.
Mistys Stonehenge Orange Wheat;Lincoln, Nebraska, United States;Witbier / Belgian White Ale;Mistys Steakhouse & Brewery;"Selling this as ""Stonehenge Orange Wheat"" now. Acidic aroma.

Jaipur IPA;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Jaipur Restaurant & Brew House;Pours straw yellow in colour. Strange aroma but a hoppy spicy taste. Not half bad
Jaipur IPA;Omaha, Nebraska, United States;IPA;Jaipur Restaurant & Brew House;Tastes like a good version of a cheap Stella. If you are into your Hoppy IPA, forget this one. You could rebottle it into a can of stella and you would not tell the difference. The aftertaste in my mouth is the same as te one you get from Bavaria. Absolutely aweful smell, like bavaria. If you are a fan of flavoursome characterful beer, avoid this overpriced beverage. If all you need to do is get drunk, you would be paying a lot for a flashy label. I prefer it when a beer has a wholesome hoppy aftertaste... maybe thats just �personal preference�. Its not worthy to call it an IPA, its just lager. A soup is not a stew.

Tower Sundowner;Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England;Blonde Ale / Golden Ale;Tower Brewery;Cask conditioned - handpump - Malt Shovel Northampton. A blonde beer with a white head and lacing. The aroma is light citrus hop. The taste has a crunchy feel to it, and I reckon there�s some wheat in there. A tasty beer but that crunchiness gets too much after a while.

Carlsberg Semper Ardens First Gold I.P.A.;Copenhagen, Denmark;IPA;Carlsberg Brewery;Not an IPA, more cheap pale ale, with sour notes in taste, with hints of sweetness. Is not complex or developing during drinking, pretty boring. Aroma is nothing special too. Mouthfeel utterly disgusting, low Co2.

Callys Plowman Porter;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Draft at the brewery. Pours dark brown with a tan head and ruby highlights. Aroma is noticeably lacking, maybe if I had let if warm up a bit it would give off a bit more. Taste is mostly roasted malts and some hops with an interesting carrot-like finish. Great carbonation makes this very drinkable. Overall a great effort from cally�s but a bit lacking in body and complexity for the style.

Callys Plowman Porter;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);This is an excellent porter, served on a co2/nitro mix at the brewpub.

Callys Plowman Porter;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);Black body. Slick nitro head. The aroma is faint, but the flavor is a bit of espresso, some chocolate and a touch of butterscotch.

Callys Plowman Porter;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);"Growler. Black, very clear, with brown head. Aromas of toasted dark malt, coffee, faint sweet malt. Dry palate with flavors of roasted black malts (very distinct grain flavor) and coffee, much like a dry stout. Decidedly thin, but this seems intentional-- it�s a simple beer, no false pretense. I find it an enjoyable take on the style. Growler split with Quintana over a batch of pumpkin homebrew; the aroma of baked pumpkin blends quite nicely with this one."
Callys Plowman Porter;Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States;Porter;Cally's Restaurant & Brewing Co. (formerly Calhoun's);"Nice, smoky, malty, in short everything you expect from a porter. It doesn�t surpass that by any means, you won�t be shocked by what is going on. But this is a good offering. UPDATE -- they also offer a limited time ""Bourbon Barrel Aged"" version of the Plowman Porter."
Sainsbury's Osprey;Holborn, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Sainsbury's;Bottle, from historic notes. From Sainsbury's Warren Heath. Poured dark amber with a lasting off-white head. Aroma of malt, caramel, fruit, bread and nut. Medium sweetness, moderate bitterness. Medium body. Seem to have quite enjoyed this.
Sainsbury's Osprey;Holborn, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Sainsbury's;"Brown 500ml bottle, best before Feb 2008 drank July 2007, brewed for the Sainsbury supermarket chain. Whenever I buy a supermarket only beer I worry, will this one be better than the norm? Read on and find out. Poured into a Corsendonk tulip glass, which it didn�t fit into, so i had two glasses. Terracotta in colour, with a tight off-white head, bubbles rising through the bright clear liquid. The head did shrink away as I drank, but not overly fast. Rich biscuits and malty sweetness hit your nose, toffees as well, it smells good. It reminded me of an old traditional sweet shop smell, all goodness and big jars of little things that rotted my teeth. The malt is in the taste too, but the sweetness has gone from the aroma leaving a dryer beer than I expected from the smell; bet it would rot my teeth though, if I left them in the beer overnight! The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a 6.5% beer, but apart from that it is one of the best supermarket only beers I have ever had."

Highgate Englands Glory;Smethwick, West Midlands, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Davenports Beer (prev Blue Bear & Highgate);"July 2009: Brown 500ml bottle (Davenports): with a years life left according to the best before date. Poured into a standard UK pint glass. Light brown, amber colour, clear and clean looking, no head, just a thin collar and a poor attempt at a wispy covering. Sweet candy aroma, strange for a UK bitter, no hops, malts or yeast in the smell at all? The rear label claimed it contained Malted Barley, a blend of Pale, Crystal and Amber, supplemented with Torrefied Wheat. Fuggles, Progress and Styrian Golding Hops. Well all I can say is; there isn�t much of any of them in the taste or aroma. There is a sweet and fruity feel to the brew, not unpleasant, just not what I was expecting from an English Bitter. The 4.3ABV is just about findable and to be fair it is easy to drink and agreeable to my palate. Difficult to score objectively, but overall not bad at all."

Bright bronze, flat white lid. Unpromising sickly cherry, marzipan and candy floss aroma, feeble dead hop and honey leaking through sugar. Crumb of nut. Pretty much the same beyond. Salvaging hint of rhubarb crumble long after the swallow. A cheap and unfermented-tasting beer swimming with pasteurised and sugar-as-ingredient buttery caramel and cherry notes. Gave it to Octo.

Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout (Barrel Aged);Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);On tap at the Merrifield Sweetwater location in March 2010. A: Pours a very dark black with a thin dark tan head. A bit of lacing as it makes its way down, mostly around the edges of the liquid. S: Loads of bourbon alongside chocolate, oak, bits of coffee, and a bit of roastiness. T: Same as with the smell, and the bourbon is really nice alongside the mostly chocolate character of the brew. A bit of oak and alcohol make their way in. M: Mouthfeel is quite viscous with low carbonation and only a slight bit of alcohol heat. D: Outstanding flavor and a beautiful mouthfeel.

Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout (Barrel Aged);Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);On tap at Sweetwater in Merrifield 3/5/2010. Pitch black out of the tap, with very little head. Nose has lots of bourbon, alcohol, and a bit of sweetness. Has a sweet roasty flavor with tons of bourbon, some licorice and a bitter finish. Overall it�s a good beer, but something�s off in the flavor that reveals itself prominently the finish, and leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Reminds me a lot of BCS, but not as well executed.
Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout (Barrel Aged);Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);Picked up a growler from the Merrifield store, doesnt actually say the words �oak aged� on it, but its what I ordered and I think this is the stuff. Pours a dark black with ruby tinges, large frothy dark chocolate head and lots of lace. Big aroma with lots of chocolaty malt, roasted with oaky tones. Flavor is rich with lots of moderately sweet malt, lots of dark chocolate, tones of fig, hints of vanilla, oak, and dark fruit: cherries, and raspberries. A noticeable alcohol presence but not at all overpowering, lightly hopped with just a touch of bitterness. A really really good beer, could be a little more complex but great smoothness and lots of terrific flavor without being overpowering.
Sweetwater Tavern High Desert Imperial Stout (Barrel Aged);Falls Church, Virginia, United States;Stout - Imperial;Sweetwater Tavern (Great American Restaurants);"On tap at Merrifield location - February 27th. Apparently this was what I had instead of the ""regular"" version. Pours a very dark black, with a relatively small dark, almost milk chocolate, tan head. The aroma is chocolates, coffee, roasted caramel and a touch of dried fruits. Flavor has a noticeable alcohol bite, with plenty of dark chocolates and roastiness. It�s not bad (as I�ve rated it pretty highly), but my only objection was that it took quite some time to actually drink - and was not really that refreshing of a beverage. Aside from that it�s one of the best crafted beers that I�ve tried from them."

Thanks egajdzis for bottling this for us and shame on me for not drinking it earlier.

Dogfish Head Sweet Home Amber Lager;Milton, Delaware, United States;Amber Lager - Intl / Vienna;Dogfish Head Brewery;Pours amber. Aroma is anise and chewy malt. Flavor is a sharp anise with a mild clean maltiness. What do you know DFH overused an exotic ingredient. It is actually a decent taste but it is hard to drink very much of it at all.
