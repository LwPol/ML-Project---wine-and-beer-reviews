Fuller's Vintage Ale 2000;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);550 mL bottle shared with ebone1988. Got this one from Derek for the book. Thanks dude. Says Best Before End 2003. Haha. The pour is a dark ruby color with a great big bright khaki colored head that slowly falls down to a thick ring of head with a ton of soapy lace left behind. This looks surprisingly good. The aroma is very sherry and alcohol heavy with a bright fruity maltiness and a strong oxidation happening on the back end. The flavor is a little better. Definitely sherry like. A bit of booze and good malt with a nice sweetness and a growing oxidation on the back end. The mouth feel is lighter medium bodied and softly carbonated with a lingering cardboard heavy sherry note on the back. This is almost cherry like. Not too bad. I’m surprised by how well this has held up. Whoa baby. 6 4 7 4 14

Rich and complex aroma of caramel, fruit jam, toffee, a bit of alcohol. Taste is rather sweet with all the nuances as the aroma, yet not cloying and at the same time with no hops whatsoever.

Fuller's Vintage Ale 2000;Chiswick, Greater London, England;Strong Ale - English;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);MARCH 2016. Quite close to the fresher 2012 vintage we’ve had at the same tasting, but certainly less malty and a bit old, dusty and oxidized.

Hazy amber, tan head. Super intense and complex - dried fruit with oxidation sherry notes that balance the big sweetness, a touch of warming alcohol. Silky smooth mouth-feel.

Roasted smell of chocolate and coffee with a tiny smoked note. At the attack a flavour intense coffee note, later the taste flattens but it spikes back at the end of the sip, leaving a rich, but not too strong, roasted aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

Aroma of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla and nougat with a nutty finish. Taste of weaker but equally dark coffee notes with the rest of the notes following suit. Light lactose hints. Small metallic note in the finish that also 'thins' out the flavour profile. Mouthfeel is very soft and surprisingly creamy for its ABV! Medium dense body which makes it incredibly drinkable while maintaining that 'sipper' quality to it. Sticky. Oily. Medium-high bitterness. Smooth, low carbonation. Rather long finish. Overall: Everything a Single Porter should have, excellent for what it is. I've always seen Fuller's as a more 'corporate' brewery that actually brews really good beers. The whole Asahi deal luckily hasn't changed this (yet). Back to the subject - great beer.

Fuller's London Porter (Bottle/Keg);Chiswick, Greater London, England;Porter;Fuller's Brewery (Asahi);The benchmark of the style. At least if you're considering beers distributed worldwide. It's a flawless Porter. Pours a dark brow with garnet hues against light and a creamy light tan head. The aroma is chocolatey all over the place. But in your palate it opens up in rich and complex dark flavors that bring chocolate, nutty, toasted, caramelly, coffee with cream and biscuity. It leaves a slightly roasted aftertaste, without any harshness. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium body, but with lots of character.

Piana beżowa, dość wysoka, o średnio długim czasie redukcji. W aromacie przenikają się wzajemnie nuty kawowe i słodkie czekoladowe, zahaczające o owoce w czekoladzie. Smak określił bym jako umiarkowanie intensywny. Jest więcej kawowej paloności, jest lekka wytrawność. Akcenty czekoladowe są nieco wycofana a w ich miejsce pojawia się lekka nuta popiołowa. Na finiszu delikatna palono popiołowa goryczka, dopełnia walory smakowe tego Porteru. Wysycenie średnie do niskiego. Średnia do niskiej ilość ciała. Piwo jest dość gładkie i miekkie.

This draft brew on nitrogen from the Market Porter in London poured a small head of light brown colored fine to medium sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a fair lacing and a uncarbonated transparent brown colored body. The aroma was like dirty socks and the mouth feel was smooth with a mild hoppy palate. It had a mild hop flavor that was missing the typical hoppiness that an American would come to expect from their IPA’s.

Off white long lasting head. Smooth. Roasted toffee aroma. Served at room temperature. A hint of cantelope pehaps? Lacks the buttery slick mouthfeel that I associate with many ESB’s. Hoppy aftertaste, big palate, good midpalate. I can’t tell what this beer wants to be- it seems a cross between the Katy and the Red.
Flat Branch Hudsons E.S.B.;Columbia, Missouri, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;cask conditioned: Light copper. Fine, suspended bubbles slowly rise to form a dense cap. Clean and delicate floral hop and nutty malt aromatics. Fruity with berrylike whispers. Soft and spaciously creamy texture. Lightly malty with chalky-tinged toasty malts and a soft floral hop base. Touch of apple acidity is present, but the rich nuttiness lessens its effect and quickly progresses to soften the body and curb the firm mineral feel. Somewhat chalky and dry finish shows highlights of leafy hops and a clear-cut nuttiness fused with palate-adhering toffee coated malt husks. Belches reveal trace amounts of phenolic esters. A wonderfully conditioned, straightforward example with a very clean/focused aroma (although a touch more dry-hopping would have been nice).

The aroma has notes of smoked and caramel malts, very roasty. Additionally I detected some cherry, prune and molasses with noticeable alcohol vapors. The taste is heavy on the malt and smoke with some fruit peaking in for good measure. The finish is quite different with a bitter quality from both a coffee tone and hop quality, even a little oaky even though it is not barrel aged. The mouthfeel is smooth, lush, and oily. This is very good stuff indeed, not a top dawg impy but most certainly stoutie worthy.

Flat Branch Old Cave Dweller Barley Wine (-2010);Columbia, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;2004 vintage consumed in early 2011 - A completely different barleywine than any of their other vintages that I had. First, its black. Even after 6 years its full of sweet fruit esters, all over the place. The strong barleywine alcohol is present as well, however it is not astringent (no astringent cherry). Sweet, alcoholic, strong, and overly fruity. Its showing no sign of age, still very fresh tasting actually. It could use more aging actually. Surprisingly ester rich.

Flat Branch Old Cave Dweller Barley Wine (-2010);Columbia, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;I may have to rerate this one. I only see one barley wine listed here, and maybe the one I had tonight (Jan 2008) is the same. Maybe not. Decent malts. Not a very intense alcohol taste. Probably could use aging. Offered a taste to my wife. She said no.
Flat Branch Old Cave Dweller Barley Wine (-2010);Columbia, Missouri, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Flat Branch Pub & Brewing;Growler: Bloody orange. Fine-sized dirty-white collar of head. Very intriguing aroma comprised of hop resin, candle wax, watermelon seeds, and strawberry esters. Only a hint of vaporous alcohol manages to shine through. Soft, dense carbonation. Fairly viscous. Initially boasts an understated snap of alcohol that cuts the array of soft fruity esters. Sneaky kiss of bready malt sweetness slowly envelops the palate and links up with the resinous hops which continue to bolster the body’s thickness. Nary a smidge of alcohol, other than the dry snap it lends. Despite the lack of hop bitterness to balance the weighty body, the sweetness never becomes too forceful. Succulent malt frame reveals a whisper of nuttiness, and is mirrored by an equally juicy dose of hops. The finish matches the aroma with a furious medley of fruity esters reminiscent of strawberry and spicy rhubarb, as the deceptively bitter hops render the palate numb. The alcohol is a non-factor in both flavor and aroma, and the balance between malt and hops is very well done. An incredibly interesting spin, although it’s more interesting than it is tasty.

Anderson Valley Poleeko Pale Ale;Boonville, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Poleeko Pale Ale pours a hazy dark amber color with a decently lived off-white head which leaves some lacing on the glass. The nose is rather subdued, but with pleasant notes of citrus, grass, muscat, brown sugar, and grains. It appears more complex on the palate, with a grainy attack of maltose and a faint hint of honey, followed by floral, lightly grapefruity and lightly grassy hops that lead to and stay with the moderately bitter and dry finish with a touch of resin. This brew showcases nice hop qualities without being overly complex, aiming to be rather easy to mouth instead. Decent!

Anderson Valley Poleeko Pale Ale;Boonville, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Hazy amber with a few particles on the bottom of the glass. About one finger of white head, ok lacing and some retention. Smells of biscuity malts with slight caramel, delicate citrus and some piney/resinous hops. Reasonably intense. Taste has a sweet malts base of biscuits and caramel, a kind of soft citric feel and a finish that shows piney hoppy notes despite being actually balanced in terms of sweetness/bitterness. Overall i would say medium to high sweet and medium bitter. Perhaps not super-clean and vivid, slightly chewy. Light bodied with average carbonation, goes down smooth and easy. Overall surely ok but it felt a little tired. Bbf says december 2018, so i suppose it was bottled on december 2017, which as fresh as you can get it here. Possibly not treated the best way.

Anderson Valley Deep Enders Dark Porter;Boonville, California, United States;Porter;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;From Jan 2007 Poured from 22oz bottle a very dark brown bordering on black. There's a huge tannish head that stays for the entire session. The smell is a good strong serving of chocolate that's quite inviting. The taste is of hot chocolate up front, with coffee notes moving in quickly bringing some quite bitter flavours to the table. Hmm...a few more sips in and there's some hops in the background that slowly make their way up the ladder and have a more pronounced presence but I'm kind of not liking the way it clashes with the chocolate. Still, it's a good Porter. Bottom line: I got to try this interesting Porter thanks to Wasatch. It's pretty good but not one I'd readily seek out.
Anderson Valley Deep Enders Dark Porter;Boonville, California, United States;Porter;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Old rating. Lots of chocolate and roasted malt. Light on the palate with more roasty. Easy drinking porter, but doesn’t really stand out.
Anderson Valley Deep Enders Dark Porter;Boonville, California, United States;Porter;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;12/17/16. On tap at World of Beer. Black pour with a small tan head. Light chocolate and coffee aroma, some caramel. Okay flavor, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, caramel, a little thin and a metallic hint.
Anderson Valley Deep Enders Dark Porter;Boonville, California, United States;Porter;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a semi-dark soft brown color with a thin finger’s worth of off white foamy head. Spider web lace. The aroma had milk and dark chocolate, delicate roast. Sly coffee far underneath. The flavor lends a hand to the sweet side initially and then as it warms, some roast and coffee comes through. Balanced somewhat of an aftertaste. Quick dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. Nice ABV and feels appropriate. Overall, nice porter worthy of more pours.
Anderson Valley Deep Enders Dark Porter;Boonville, California, United States;Porter;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;On tap at Fat Heads Pittsburgh. Pours a dark brown with small beige head that lasts. The aroma is roast and dark chocolate. Medium body, roast, cocoa, pine, bitter finish, good.
Anderson Valley Deep Enders Dark Porter;Boonville, California, United States;Porter;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;On tap at Engine 15 (JAX). Good looking clear, reddish-brown body. Dark body is topped by a decent head with excellent lacing. Very nice aroma that precedes a relatively mild (weak) but appealing flavor. The body seems a bit too thin.

Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Si te gusta la malta está es para ti. A mí me gustan más amargas. No me gustó mucho.
Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;355 ml. bottle @ home, served in a tulip glass, due date: unknown. Aroma: not very intense aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malts, black coffee, oatmeal. Hints of dark dried fruits, dates, prunes, plums, caramel. Appearance: very dark brown color, almost black with beige to light brown foam made of tiny to big sized bubbles. Low to medium head thickness with medium to high retention and low Brussels' lacing. Taste: medium sweetness, low bitterness, low sourness. Flavors of prunes, plums, caramel, roasted malts, toasted malts, oats, black chocolate, roasted malts, black coffee, licorice, cocoa. Balance is slightly toward the sweetness. Mouthfeel: medium body, watery to slightly oily texture, low carbonation, quite long sweet finish with low sweetness and the same aforementioned flavors. Alcohol is noticeable because of its throat and mouth warming. Astringency is not noticeable. Overall: good appearance, not very intense aromas and quite intense flavors of plums, prunes, raisins, dates, dark dried fruits, black coffee, black chocolate, roasted malts. Maybe it would be better with a less watery texture. Not bad but quite weird for an oatmeal stout with all those dark dried fruits. The dark dried fruits flavors are less powerful when the beer gets warmed.
Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Pours a jet black with a tan foam head. Aroma is chocolate, oatmeal, and caramel. Flavor is sweet oat, chocolate, and caramel, with maybe a touch of molasses. Has some carbonation and a light body. Decent.

Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Has potential to be slightly better....only complaint is that I wanted a deeper-richer flavor and texture. On the thinner side for a stout, but just makes it easier to drink!! Nice chocolate and oatmeal flavors, caramel malts, etc. I wanted a little more hops also, but that would make this into a porter I guess. Appearance is about as good as it gets, dark black with mocha head. A little creamier textured and this would be perfect appearance and mouthfeel. Another good beer from Cali, but sorry to say with so many out there, that it may be forgettable.
Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout;Boonville, California, United States;Stout - Oatmeal;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Black beer, thin head. Malty chocolate aroma.

Anderson Valley Boont ESB;Boonville, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;"From Jan 2007 Poured from 12oz bottle a cloudy orange with a large head of foam that shrank quickly leaving very little by the time I got half way through and..there's just a tad of lacing. The smell is of caramel malt with a bit of citrus. The taste is very malty...lots of nice caramel malt flavour up front. There's just a hint of hop bitterness in the background, mainly lemon, that offsets the malt sweetness just a tad but this is all about the malt and a fine example of an ESB. Yummy. Even the finish is sweet though it does fall off right at the end and concludes on the dry side. I wish I had another as I really appreciate ESBs that are true to form. Bottom line: A very good ESB that I can easily recommend! Another brew obtained via Wasatch; thanks bud!"
Anderson Valley Boont ESB;Boonville, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Poured into a mug, the appearance had a dark copper to amber color with a finger’s worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a fine pace. Messy lace. The aroma some bready malts, a touch of spicy hops, slight floral, and then sweet butter (not diacetyl). The flavor blended sweet biscuits/bready malts to sweet butter fairly nice. Grassy and spicy hops slide in nicely. Slick biscuit/bready aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation felt good, maybe just a tad more than expected, but wasn’t distracting. ABV seemed appropriate and projected as the brewer said. Overall, mostly pretty good ESB with just a touch more carbonation than I thought would be there, but hey, coming all of the way from California and bottled, I guess it makes sense why.
Anderson Valley Boont ESB;Boonville, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;A full body, ambrosial maltiness, and an arousing hoppy bite. This beer is not for the light beer drinker or those desiring no aftertaste. Note: Formerly known as Belk’s ESB.
Anderson Valley Boont ESB;Boonville, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;"nice 1"" white head recedes slowly leaving nice lacing atop a slightly hazy.. dark yellow/amber brew. Aroma is bready malts and spicy hops... nothing over the top.. just balanced by a pronounced yeasty ester profile. Flavor is more of the same with a slight buttery slickness (not distracting, just there)... biscuity flavors... toasted grains and more English hops. Big boned for sure.. but not overdone. Body is smack dab medium with low/medium carbonation. For such a large West Coast ESB, I always expect a quite a bit more hoppiness out of this one... If you’re using English hops, then let me taste them! That being said, the above negatives are only suggestions... this beer is very drinkable with a great body."
Anderson Valley Boont ESB;Boonville, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;(bottle) Still labeled as Belk’s ESB, with no bottle date, hard to know how old this is. Pours a hazy orange complexion with lasting head and glass lacing. Aroma of dough and malt. The flavor follows the traditional British style with an understated hop note.
Anderson Valley Boont ESB;Boonville, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Backlog from lost & found notes: Aroma is malty and floral. Taste is solid but one dimensional, malts with citrus tones and a gentle hop character. Medium bitter.
Anderson Valley Boont ESB;Boonville, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;A 12 fl oz bottle with no visible best by or bottled date and poured into a pint glass. Poured a slightly hazy orangey copper colour with a one finger off white head that dissipates within a minute leaving some stringy lacing. Aromas were a bit weak but what little I do get is caramel malts, some fruitiness like plum, pear, apple sauce and orange plus hints of mineral notes. Taste is more pronounced with strong caramel sweetness beginning and citrus grapefruit bitterness finish with hints of pine, grass and pepper in between. Medium bodied with low carbonation and dry finish. This was decent but nothing special. I think I may prefer it more if it had a little less of the caramel sweetness.
Anderson Valley Boont ESB;Boonville, California, United States;Bitter - Premium / Strong / ESB;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Poured a light orange color with a small white head. Aroma was some light caramel malts, light toasted notes, with a touch of sweet malts. Light fruity notes.

Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA;Boonville, California, United States;IPA;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Keg at BrewDog Liverpool in 2016. Hazy amber with a white head. Aroma of pale malt, caramel, pine and somewhat oxidised hops. Flavour had become quite sweet. Fairly sure I had this in the US years ago and thought it was really nice. Don’t think this travelled too well.

Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA;Boonville, California, United States;IPA;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;This one has potential to be better, but just slightly above average IPA. Nice strength to it....both malty and hoppy. However, the balance could be a better...as well as the feel. Flavor is good though. Light brown to orange appearance. This and the brown ale were the ones I liked in the variety pack. So far, finding Anderson Valley a forgettable brewery.

Mouthfeel is slightly watery and light (a little shocking after the nose) with little CO2. Very bitter finish, as expected, that lasts long but not super-long. So-so.
Anderson Valley Hop Ottin IPA;Boonville, California, United States;IPA;Anderson Valley Brewing Company;Bottled 0,355L.

Good malt body, a nice crisp hop bitterness make this a very enjoyable brew. A good step up to something new for your Lager drinking friends!

This is more of a red ale style beer - copper amber in color with a fine white foamy head. Aroma is mild, but is definitely hoppy in character. First taste is a sharp hop bite - slightly acidic in character. Unfortunately, nothing much develops after that. There is a slight aluminum or metallic flavor at the finish that is questionable. This is one I want to try again to see if this was just an ""off"" keg."

Taste: very sweet cherries, sparkling sweet wine, and just a hint of horse on the finish. I mean, sure they add sugar and all that, but tastewise it's one of the easiest beers to drink. I guess either my tastebuds are really cheap or I haven't drunk enough lambics to be able to review them correctly
Lindemans Kriek;St Pieters Leeuw-Vlezenbeek, Belgium;Lambic - Fruited;Brouwerij Lindemans;The taste is ok, can’t find defects, but it’s the aftertaste after the sip that doesn’t convince me, not persistent. Good beer, but not worth the price

Hoppy Face Amber Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;IPA;Hoppy Brewing Company;Lives up to it's name as far as hopiness goes, but the balance not the greatest here. Bitter in a not-so-good way.

Hoppy Face Amber Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;IPA;Hoppy Brewing Company;A bit of an unusual Amber... if it’s appropriate to call it that. Like many West Coast Ambers it’s highly hopped for the style. Amber color and off-white suds. There is toasted character. It’s got citrusy hops and typical Amber Ale notes of caramel and biscuit. There’s a chocolaty note at mid-mouth which would be really nice except it comes against a hoppy earthiness. Interesting yet it doesn’t quite work.

Kind of skunky on that end, so not sure if old or what, but besides that a solid brew. My first sample from Hoppy and am impressed. Not sure if a porter or black ale like the label says. I'd say more like a porter. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, little bit of finishing hops. Tastes like some burnt sugar which may be the bitter aftertaste. Has potential, but the skunk aroma is bringing this rating down a bit.
Hoppy Total Eclipse Black Ale;Sacramento, California, United States;Stout;Hoppy Brewing Company;Not a bad black ale. Roastier than most. Hops are piney with a sharp bitterness at the end. Dark, almost burned coffee flavor. Tried with Jess at the Nebraska Beerfest in 2016.

Mendocino Red Tail Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);6%ABV. Amber ale. Poured out slightly cloudy rust. 16ºSRM. Nose is beery and malty. There is slight funkiness to the nose, a little dank and with the sweet eatery aroma of warm over ripe fruit. Nose also has dates and some spiciness in the nose suggesting nutmeg. Mouthfeel is soapy. There is good carbonation. The palate has sweet malt body with the spiciness of rye. Other flavors include graham crackers, honey, dates, raisins. The toasty malty sweetness is pronounced and forms a very solid backbone to this surprisingly easy to appreciate ale.

Mendocino Blue Heron Pale Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Pours a crisp clear golden with a tall 2.5 finger white head and plenty of carbonation fizzing around. Has a grainy bready aroma with a metallic hint and some light spruce. Has a resin and toast flavor with light floral on the back and hoppy bitterness throughout. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing however. Not a bad beer but I expected a little more from a Pale Ale.
Mendocino Black Hawk Stout;Ukiah, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);Bought a 6-pack of this because the price was right. I liked their Eye of the Hawk better. Tried that one first, so was hoping this stout would be equally as good. Not a bad stout, just a bit thin and somewhat lacking of flavor. Probably better than Guiness, but for this style I still prefer my 8-ball stout. Thinking this may be better on tap, but I do not live in Cali and only see it in bottles here.

Mendocino Black Hawk Stout;Ukiah, California, United States;Stout - Dry;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);From Aug 2007 I got this one in a trade with Wasatch. Thanks, John! This pours from 12oz bottle a near pitch black with a small head of foam. A few minutes in and all that's left is a few small islands in the middle and a ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal. The smell is full of sweet malt to my nose. The taste has a lot of caramel malt up front that starts off very sweet but that's offset quickly by some hop bitterness that cuts the level of sweetness pretty well. I also get some good chocolate notes along with some roasted malt and an earthy flavour also shows up. It finishes slightly bitter but at the very end, it comes off on the watery side. It has a good mouthfeel to it for the style and the carbonation is fairly brisk. Pretty good stout in my book.

Mendocino Eye of the Hawk Select Ale;Ukiah, California, United States;Strong Ale - American;Mendocino Brewing Company (United Breweries Group);I am enjoying this beer. Split a 6-pack with my brother in-law, so sampling my 3rd one now. The first 2 seemed a little better, so glad that I had a few on different occasions to get a better idea. Has a light brown to orange semi-cloudy appearance. Flavor is mostly malty, but a decent hop finish to balance out nicely. Not much carbonation with minimal head. For the price and ABV%, this is definitely worth the try. Will probably get again somewhere down the road. Wish I lived in Mendocino!

Sugary nose of caramel and faux-bubblegum, cotton candy and a nary a whiff of hop. Suprisingly dry flavor that’s a touch herbal and bitter with a bright caramalty backing and a boozy phenolic tone.

Also it has one awesome label outside and your imagination flying. Anyway the aroma remind me a lot the ""Belgium Pauwel Kwak"" beer and also little the colour.. The taste was something between ""Lager"" and some ""Belgium"" beer in the aftertaste.. The first mouthfeel was slightly bitter and remind you a lot ""Lager"" beers and the aftertaste was very malty and remind some ""Belgium"" beers like ""Leffe Blond"" and ""Pauwel kwak"".. This combination little trouble me but definitely i enjoy that beer despite is not my style.. I like more sweet beers and less bitter..

Sierra Nevada Wheat;Chico, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;From Aug 2007 This pours from 12oz bottle a cloudy, lively straw gold and it has a very good head of foam that shrinks but only just. Here I am, near the end of my bottle and there's one fine solid layer of foam and it has lots of nice lacing. Great looking brew! The smell has a good wheat nose with some citrus and some sweet malt. The taste is nice. I'm getting the wheat up front and that's quickly followed by some earthy malt and midway through, I get a good hop punch that takes the form of citrus lemon that lasts right through the finish and leaves a pleasing bitter aftertaste. Hmm...this is a good tasting Wheat beer and it's pretty darned quaffable. I'll buy more of this for sure. I recommend it.
Sierra Nevada Wheat;Chico, California, United States;Wheat Ale;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Different, but excellent American wheat beer. Light aroma of citrus.

Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale;Chico, California, United States;IPA;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"4th beer review. Not knowledge enough to take apart the flavours in this beer but I thought I’d say what I can anyway. Nice breads/biscuity and hoppy aroma, lovey 2 finger tan head, looks great. Lots of flavours but not overwhelming, bitterness is reasonably long that lingers in the mouth nicely. A nice flavoursome beer but personally not my favourite; I’m sure others love it for what it is though."

Una gran barleywine, muy potente, descarada y peligrosa.
Sierra Nevada Bigfoot;Chico, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Seems to be somewhere in between an IPA and a barley wine. Dry hoppy character was a little much for the style, but was still nice nonetheless. COuld have used some more tarty sweetness

Sierra Nevada Bigfoot;Chico, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Packages 23 Feb 2017 Drank 16 August 2019. Aroma is very rich, caramel, burnt sugar, dark fruits, plum pudding, prunes, figs, pumpernickle bread, malty, lovely. Appearance is a dark amber, slighly cloudy, slightly tan-ish head thats quite thick and lingers leaving thick tan lacing. Taste is initially a boozy indecipherable hit then straight into a big broad bitterness, bitterring hops and grapefruit pith. Then cocoa, burnt sugar, dark roast and black malts, a cognac-like boozyness, coffee grounds. very malty, very rich, no sweetness at all. Very big, very full on, then it subsides leaving a hoppy bitterness on the tongue before it becomes cloying or overbearing. That hoppy bitterness just lingers on. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light, slight viscosity that fades and a light carbonation. I do not usually enjoy Bigfoot very much when i drink it fresh - the year its made. I was lucky to find this at my LBS and its the first time I have had a barley wine with a few years on it. This was fantastic.
Sierra Nevada Bigfoot;Chico, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Copper, clean, tan Beerhead, with creamy, frothy and firm foam. Good head retention. Malty-richness aroma, such as caramel, toffee, raisins, dark plum, whole-grain breads, and slight chocolate and pinewood hints. Intensive sweetness, Medium-high bitterness, alcoholic warmth, soft carbonation, mild touch. The concentrated malty characters include dark caramel, toffee, vanilla, raisins, chocolate and pinewood hints. good for sipping rather than drinking. Highly Recommended.
Sierra Nevada Bigfoot;Chico, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Deep ruby pour with aggressively separating tan head 2 inches thick. Rich hop aroma of citrus and melon with pink grapefruit. Secondary nose of deep toasted caramel malts. Incredible nose here that lets you know right away you're in for a big beer. First taste does not disappoint in any way as this is simultaneously a hop monster and a malt monster. Huge, sticky mouthfeel. My glass was laced intricately and the beer continued to warm the throat and leave tart notes of grapefruit upon the tongue. At a whopping 90 IBUs, the incredible hop additions must be commended here. Truly a deep, rich beer. If you're looking for a comparison I would say Dogfish Head 90 Minute -- yes, it's on that level of quality. Even the 9.6% ABV is well masked. One minor criticism, the bitterness is perhaps a bit overbearingly rind-ish in the finish. I don't consider there to be many wine characteristics present, but then again I'm not a wine drinker. If you love massive hops and malt, this beer should shine for you.
Sierra Nevada Bigfoot;Chico, California, United States;BarleyWine / WheatWine / RyeWine;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;2018 vintage, purchased from Cool Wine in Hobart. Dark Amber colour, light tan head that faded quickly. Nose of toffee, caramel, prunes. On the palate, strong bitterness and US hops, dark malts, more dried fruit than roast, but somewhat obscured by hops. Tasty beer, but a little more bitter than I’d like. Well balanced for its strength.

Sierra Nevada Old Chico Pale Bock;Chico, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Beautiful crystal clear medium yellow/gold body with a foamy white head. Clean wheat and toasted malt aromas with a hint of salty sea air. More toasted grain in the flavor with a doughy breadiness. Lightly pungent and earthy hop bitterness rises up through the honeyed sweetness that fills your whole mouth. Body is light but creamy in texture. A mild and tasty yeastiness pervades throughout and continues to linger through the finish which is sweet and bready. Thoroughly delicious, a seasonal beer to look forward to each year.
Sierra Nevada Old Chico Pale Bock;Chico, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;10 ounce sample on tap at the brewery. Aroma is hard to detect due to all of the smoke in this place from the pizza oven. Maybe a light bready malt. Transparent golden yellow body with a medium white head. Starts with a bit of a metallic character before it becomes a little sweet with cereal in the middle. Finishes with a bit of an herbal hop flavor. A decent Heller Bock, as far as Heller Bocks go...
Sierra Nevada Old Chico Pale Bock;Chico, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Bottle @ Patrick’s Haus. Clear golden pour with a white head. Lots of yeast and sulfur on the nose. Sweet grain and bready malts, too. Light hop character of grass, earth, and spice. Somewhat estery, too. Light graham cracker, smoked almond, and baked apple.

Sierra Nevada Old Chico Pale Bock;Chico, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle purchased yesterday at the Mills River, NC brewery. The aroma is more hoppy than malty; lightly spicy. The flavor is just as one might expect for this mix of styles: tastes like a pale ale (although this is a lager) with some (not quite 50%) bock added. Feel: smooth body with crisp and lively carbonation. O: Distinct yet highly drinkable, I can readily understand why this re-introduced beer is a ""cult classic""."
Sierra Nevada Old Chico Pale Bock;Chico, California, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Sierra Nevada Brewing Company;Pours a clear golden from the bottle with dissipating white head that leaves moderate lace.

St. Stans Storm Rider Amber;Modesto, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;St. Stans Brewing Company;It’s nice to see bottles of this again in the stores. It had been years since St. Stan’s was in bottle so a recent trip to the store and I’m two 6-packs richer of St. Stan. This beer pours out a solid amber color, clear with a nice two-finger thick off-white head which dissipated to about half an inch thick and stayed there. Aroma is iced tea, light caramel and a touch of grassy hops. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Flavors had that tannic iced tea quality, minimally sweet with a low bitterness level that was undefined. Easy to drink, nothing offensive or pleasing either way.

St. Stans Storm Rider Amber;Modesto, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;St. Stans Brewing Company;This was a hard Alt to rate. Very thin despite its bitterness.

An aroma of roasted malts, dark chocolate and a bit of coffee. Appearance was black with a nice tan head. Mouthfeel was solid. Flavors were coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malt. Nothing bad for sure, and suprisingly good. I’d drink it again for sure.

St. Stans Red Sky Ale;Modesto, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St. Stans Brewing Company;On Draft @ The pub. Pours a light brownish color with no hint of red. The color really looked like someone soaked one of those barrel- shaped root beer candies in water. There was no aroma what-so-ever. The flavors seemed to me to be all over the place. Very lively, almost sour in a way. The aftertaste kind of reminded me of vinyl or plastic. Nice lacing on the glass though
St. Stans Red Sky Ale;Modesto, California, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;St. Stans Brewing Company;Small head, moderate lacing, with a dark orange color. Aroma was almost non-existent.

Nose is sweetly malt, almost like cotton candy, fresh and clean with the start quite sweet and malt laden, top is middling in feel to the palate.

St. Stans Dark;Modesto, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;St. Stans Brewing Company;If you judged a book by it’s cover, or in this case the beer’s appearance, you’d think that you were getting one helluva beer. A beautiful pour with a dark mahogany body with cherrywood edges underneath a rich light tan head. It was a damn shame I had to smell and drink it. Aroma was barely any malts, metallic somewhat with some old wet graineyness. Thin body. Flavors of old cereal, subtle chocolate notes and club soda. Nothing tasty with this and it’s easily one of my least favorite beers from these guys to date.

St. Stans Dark;Modesto, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;St. Stans Brewing Company;"(12 oz bottle: Wine Time in La Jolla, CA) On the dollar shelf, so I’m not expecting much here, but you never know. There isn’t a whole lot of carbonation release as I open this beer, and a light-tan sheen is slow to form on the pour, but much quicker to dissipate to a small ring. The body is a very dark ruddy-brown with a slight translucence. I’m surprised at how flavorful this beer is, and that oxidation seems pretty mild. It’s malty and moderately sweet, with brown sugar and molasses. There’s plenty of mildly bitter, dark roasted malts, chocolate and coffee, more than I expected from an alt, and the rather potent smokiness in the finish is a pleasant surprise. There is an overtone of green peppers with a very slight spicy character and slightly astringent bitterness. It’s an old bottle of beer, so the moderate earthy flavor is not surprising, and is actually adds a positive note to the overall flavor. The nose is sweet, earthy and malty, with a slight smoky quality. Body is medium ""plus"", and despite the signs of poor carbonation, it’s gently carbonated, but not flat. All in all, a decent beer with a few minor issues from the age, but given that this is probably a few years old, I think the beer has held up remarkably well. Not bad at all, although it’s considerably different from any of the other altbiers I’ve tried. I’m cool with that though."

St. Stans Dark;Modesto, California, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;St. Stans Brewing Company;Bottle: This poured a dark ruby-brown color with a rapidly fading tan head. Not a bad brew, but it seemed quite unlike the handful of altbiers that I’ve had to date. This had a strong chocolate, coffee, and smoke aroma. Nicely carbonated, it had a roasted malt flavor supported by the same coffee, chocolate, and smoke that appeared in the aroma. The finish is oddly sticky and sweet. Alt? Beer on the Wall

Kozel Světlý (Pale) 10°;Velké Popovice, Czech Republic;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;Pivovar Velké Popovice (Asahi);Keg at the Blue Boar, Witney. Pale gold with a thin white head and a soft, frothy fizz. Buttery with herbal hops and a dissolved paperclip. The metallic herb thing gets a bit harsh, found it a little hard going if I'm honest. But (as with most Czech brews) it still has more character and a better mouthfeel than the bigger lager brands.

Great Dane Parkers Publican Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Draft at the brewpub (downtown location).

Tasted of biscuity malt and grassy hops. Not bad.
Great Dane Parkers Publican Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On tap at Great Dane - Downtown. Poured clear bright golden with a full head (I’m talkin’ a whole glass of head initially!). The aroma was bright, zesty, and refreshing with prevalent lemon zest and bready notes.. very well presented. The flavor had a pale bready base to it with somewhat brash lemon rind and astringency at the edges.. drier, partially refreshing finish. Light-bodied and tart on the palate with OK balance.. aiight.
Great Dane Parkers Publican Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Clear gold color with no head. Very sugary aroma. Flavors of banana and orange abound. The finish is somewhat yeasty. Very odd Pale.
Great Dane Parkers Publican Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Cask version. First impression of the aroma is that it came from dirty lines. Not really hoppy. Sweet and rough. Slightly hazy darker gold. Head is diminishing. Warm and mellow flavor, decent. A little overly subtle, but gets better at mid glass.
Great Dane Parkers Publican Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;Cask. Arrived completely flat. Pale copper. Aroma is really strange. Minty, herbal, kind of a funny metalic smell, toothpaste, light malt. Warm malt, good level of bitterness. Medium body, but the utter lack of carbonation leaves it kind of lifeless.
Great Dane Parkers Publican Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On cask. Sharp, minty aroma with a slight metallic twist. It is sortof like a sweaty handful of old coins. Pale orange color with not even the slightest hint of a head. Bland, dissapointingly thin flavor. Some light malt, not even a fraction as good as the aroma. Completely flat, no trace of carbonation at all. I know casks are supposed to be flatter than taps, but I think this one took it too far. I’ve had better cask ale at the Dane.
Great Dane Parkers Publican Pale Ale;Madison, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Ale - English;Great Dane Pub & Brewery;On cask. Very light-colored body - light gold. Warm, smooth body and flavor. Starts with fresh-out-of-the-oven yeasy white bread, followed by unripe apricot hops. Caramelly, sweet aroma. An APA with a very low hopping rate. Lively, if dry overall flavor.

Kozel Free;Velké Popovice, Czech Republic;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Pivovar Velké Popovice (Asahi);Sampled from bottle. I bought this beer by accident, not knowing it was non-alcoholic. So, I just put it in the back of the ole beer cabinet. According to the label, there are situations when you can’t drink your favorite beer. This is one of those times so I’m finally drinking this NA beer. Pours clear gold with a scattered white head. Aroma is mild and hoppy (noble) with a hint of plastic. Flavor is balanced and clean. Just a hint of plastic. Light-bodied, moderately carbonated and just strange - like it was fermented in a milk jug or something. I hope I never get to the point I have to drink NA beer, or no beer at all. It’ll be a sad day.

En trippel på den sötare delen av trippelspektrat. Söta maltsmaker med söta äpplen, apelsinblom och lite syltade apelsinskal och en ganska markerad apelsinskalsbeska som räddar balansen.

A bit on the sweet side and unbalanced. But solid.
Steenbrugge Dubbel Bruin;Londerzeel, Belgium;Dubbel;Brouwerij Palm (Swinkels Family Brewers);Nice, if straightforward and uncomplicated Belgian brown. Sweet spicy notes on the nose, and just a slight bit less complexity than the nose makes you expect. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Steenbrugge Tripel;Londerzeel, Belgium;Tripel;Brouwerij Palm (Swinkels Family Brewers);I was quite pleased to see a 750 ml bottle of Steenbrugge Tripel available at a Total Wine in Ft. Worth over last Thanksgiving. I have cooled it off and opening it now. Foil wrapped, caged and corked like a bottle of champagne. Interesting. I pour into my Cowtown tulip glass, from Ft. Worth also. It arrives a dark gold-orange with a thin but persistent pure white top. I take a sniff, yellow fruit, honey and lightly floral. And finally a drink. A little peach, a little apricot, grain, a bit of sweetness. Decently bitter. Something just doesn't come together here, overall far from the top tripel for me.

Brugs Blond;Londerzeel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Palm (Swinkels Family Brewers);"Rating 1049. (Beer listed on menu and on glass as ""Witbier - Beir Blanche - my rating should probably go here but if not please notify me and I will move it) On tap served in a trappist glass at this nice little cafe 1 block north of the Louvre in Paris. Hazy lazy medoum brightness golden with a medium sized long lasting foamy white head. Nose is strong with lots of yeast, malts and grains. Taste is more earthy, more yeasty and a lot of grain and piney hops. A good beer in a great city. The experience is what made this beer."
Brugs Blond;Londerzeel, Belgium;Belgian Ale - Pale / Golden;Brouwerij Palm (Swinkels Family Brewers);"Bottle, own flute glass @ De’ Pub, Brugges Belgium. Sparkling, bright amber body that was well charged with fine streams of carbonation that erupted up to a firm, 1½"", rocky white head of foam that laced wildly down the glass. Woody, piney and malty sweet aroma that was full and edged by a lick of tangy marmalade and some alcohol spice. Similar in the mouth with some dominant sweet, toffee and biscuity malts balanced by husky grains, tangy fruit conserve and a spicy, peppery backdrop. Bitter on the swallow, good length in the malty aftertaste with hints of vanilla and straw. It actually comes off refreshing. Nice firm body, quite light in carbonation, prickly, and creamy in the back. Quite liked this, as far as blonde’s go this is in a separate field altogether. Nice balance, tasty and quenching. A solid Belgian ale. (33cL, no date stamp, labelled Brugse Blond)"

Banana, brown sugar and toffee. Humid Cellar. Light carbonation. Thin, oily, lightly tingling texture. Flavor is medium sweet followed by a more moderate bitterness. Aftertaste is sweetish.

Miller Lite;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);A good tasting beer that resembles one of a Coors Light. It has a light beer taste, and is quality when enjoyed cold. Also a great beverage for party games or just to enjoy with the boys on a boat.

Miller Lite Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pours yellow with white head, aroma is some corn, grain.

Miller Genuine Draft (MGD);Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pale golden color, weak white head.

Miller Genuine Draft Light (MGD Light);Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Budweiser’s staunchest opponent, this beer’s most redeeming qualities are that it’s easy drinking, easy going and fairly cheap. Not much of an aroma, but a faint floral hoppy smell. It pours a light golden coppery color and has a somewhat sickly sweet hoppy taste with a bad finish. Maybe a little better than Budweiser. Has a beady head that has moderate staying power. Overall it’s basically what I call a ’me too’ product. It does the same thing as Budweiser. Not much personality, but is very easy to drink. These beers aren’t the kind you should try to get drunk on, these are the beers you drink to relax while mowing the lawn or as a cheap party favorite.

Miller High Life;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);People can trash this beer all they want, but for what it is, I absolutely love it. It's a classic American blue-collar lager and it's a crisp refreshing beer. Decent sweetness, light bitterness, decent body, nice pale golden color. I've gotta say it's probably my favorite macro brew.
Miller High Life;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Not everyone enjoys Coco or grapefruit or God knows what else brewed into their beer. As far as cheap American beers go this is one of the better offerings. It's tasty cold and is affordable. Goes down smooth and tastes fine with food. We aren't from your country so some of your beers taste pretty piss poor to us as well. Just throwing that out there. My beer doesn't need to feel like I just ate an entire meal after drinking one. This beer is great cold after mowing the lawn or a hard day at work. This is naturally a light beer anything lighter and you might float away.

Miller High Life;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Miller High Life is probably the best of the ""cheap American beer"" category. People look down on them because, admittedly, there are tons of craft beers that are objectively better. That being said, there is no denying a nice, crisp, easy drinking macro beer is very enjoyable to most people. Miller High Life is inoffensive, clean, and has an actual flavor to it. It won't win any awards for bold flavor, but it is a clear highlight in the category in which it resides. Easily my favorite macro beer."

I have a vacation in 4 weeks so decided to get some High Life Light as my cheap beer, what the heck lol. I mean it's fine for what it is. Decent with food. No foul flavors, drinks easy, cheap, low calorie. Good for an American light pale lager.
Miller High Life Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Little light on the taste. Nothing offensive about this beer. It’s drinkable. Just not very flavorful. Cheers. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone

Poured into glass because who doesn’t want to be a little classy while they drink some fine domestic beer? Color is uninspiring...looks like something that comes out of you after consumption if you know what I mean. Nose is grainy and kind of metallic. Taste is basically what you would expect...plenty of grainy, cereal characteristics. Little to no finish to be found. It’s crisp so that’s one compliment I can give it. Very generic. This reminds me of beer I may have tried as a kid that inspired some sort of statement like ""I’m never going to drink beer when I get older"". I would prefer the full on caloric option."

Red Dog;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Malty with a subtle hint of metal. Hops are present if subdued. Head is rocky, but falls flat into a few patches of nothing. Small patches of lace on the glass. Looks like a typical adjunct lager.

Meh.
Red Dog;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle when underage, pours gold. Notes are ass, skunked beer, and corn. Light and thin bodied. Terrible beer on all accounts.

Pours crystal clear medium golden yellow color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. A touch of fruity aromas, but not overwhelming. Nice and pleasant aromas with pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, light corn/pepper, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Moderately crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and fairly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5%. Overall this is a nice pale adjunct lager. All around nice obustness and balance of pale malt/grains and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery for the ABV. Very clean pale malt/grain flavors, and nice earthy hop presence for the style. Really nice barley presence, and not overdone on adjuncts at all. A nicely enjoyable offering, and well made style example as expected of Miller."
Red Dog;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24oz can pours a clear pale golden with a large white head. Corn malt aroma. Taste of mild smooth corn grain with light lager yeast. Yep beer, non offensive chugging beer.
Red Dog;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Old college rating. A little grainy/bitter bite, a little abrasive but made it unique in the style.
Red Dog;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Memory rating...not a terrible beer...flavor was ok...they really make this still?...drinkable in a pinch.
Red Dog;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Rated from old notes. So non-deScript it defies deScription. Weak, bland, watery drink with bubbles and some fizz. That pretty much sums it up. Do not buy it, and if gifted, nod politely, smile, and drainpour at the first opportunity.
Red Dog;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Medium bodied, full flavor and absulutely NOT watery and bad (quite the opposite). Piney. Golden color when poured into glass. Medium carbonation.
Red Dog;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Originally rated on 2/6/08- Well i guess you get what you pay for.. thin and weak, and the little flavor that was there was awful. Tastes as if it were brewed with dog. Avoid this beer.
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Watery and almost without taste and therefore very difficult to rate because is that really a bad thing? I can't find any bad flavors either and it was actually quite nice after a long day in the sun.
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 oz can between three on 20th March 2019. Most likely the best Miller's product I have had and this isn't anything I could recommend to anyone. Clear and clean looking beer, light golden in colour, white affair on top. Aroma held grainy corn esters with a slight floral twist. Taste also grainy and corny, light hop bitterness for balance. Refreshing and thirst quenching but not really much going on flavour wise.
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);For a beer with a hint of rubbing alcohol aftertaste, it starts smoothish and finishes with that hit of rubbing alcohol
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Well I was looking for something cold to hydrate with while doing some yardwork, found this left over in the fridge from a few months ago, figured I might as well give it the old college try since I intentionally avoided this brew through college. Surprisingly was not terrible, actually looked like an average golden yellow lager with a bright white foamy head. Aroma was rough macro grain and corn, but was fairly clean and not skunky. A touch of ethanol on the nose also, not a good sign for a 5.5% lager. The taste did not have much flavor other then some faint grainy malt and adjuncts, absolutely zero hoppiness, but the lack of flavor is better than having the foul funky and skunky flavor which is the norm for economy macro-lagers. Astringent and pungent corny aftertaste that leaves an unpleasant dry “cotton-mouth” sensation, overall not very refreshing. Final verdict: I didn’t finish the 16 ounce can and won’t ever drink this again. That being said, it’s not the worst out there.
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"24 ounce can into lager glass, best before 9/9/2018. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and mild herbal/grassy earthiness. A bit too fruity with mild metallic notes in the aromas. Poor aromas with pale malt/corn and mild earthy hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness. Light herbal, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of cracker, corn, white bread dough, lightly toasted biscuit, and light herbal/grassy earthiness for a good bit. Nice robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Fairly crisp/clean finishing. Perfectly clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and carbonation. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Mildly increasing alcohol warmth after the finish. Overall this is a solid pale adjunct lager. All around good robustness of pale malt/corn and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink. Very flavorful and not watery. Clean pale malt/grains and solid earthy hop presence/balance for the style. A nicely enjoyable offering, despite the off noted aromas."
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Couldn't tell you how many times I ordered this in a club or bar.....old days of course. I never really minded an Icehouse. Then I started drinking craft and probably never ordered an Icehouse again. OK party beer if the economics/demand require swill. I would also have to agree that it may be the most drinkable of the swills. Not super-skunky which is pretty much mandatory for me.
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);i tried the 6.9 and now the 5.5 i must say the 6.9 was a bit strong not that i didn't like it but the 5.5 was to much of a drop may i suggest a 6.0 meet me half way....but besides that, i like it very much great tasting beer great job........
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Pale gold pour with a rocky, white head. The aroma is mostly straw. It has a light, watery body with average carbonation. The taste is bland and quick.
Icehouse;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Starting 2018 off right with an American classic! Pours pale golden, perfectly clear with lots of tiny bubbles, & a big fluffy white head. The aroma is metallic and a touch doughy, weird... not awful just not especially ""beery"" The flavor is sweet with a little zip of hoppiness and a relatively neutral flavor generally. There is a bit of apple character & a touch of honey like maltiness with a little bit of lingering corn. But yeah, it's reasonably inoffensive & fairly clean. I can see why my college friends drank a bunch of this, this would be a good beer to keep a 20 year old on the ßøøst all the ding dang summertime."

Milwaukee's Best Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is a fairly basic macro. Yellow body with a white head. This is both simple and forgettable in nose and taste void of distinct malt or hops.
Milwaukee's Best Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Now come on sissy fellows it's a easy on the wallet beer that our granddads drink and I occasionally drink in memory of my hero.

Milwaukee's Best Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Difficult to separate this beer from the other light macro lagers. Perhaps a bit sweeter but no more body or character than others.

Milwaukee's Best Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Used to drink mic ultra light but kinda expensive so I switched to this cause the price is right.

Milwaukee's Best Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 oz. can pour into a tumbler (perhaps slightly better than the swig straight from the can) in memory of Zet. Appearance is clear, pale yellow with tons of sparkle, finger-plus width foamy white head with fair retention and decent soapy lacing. Aroma is biscuit, pilsner malt, cardboard, vague fruit. Taste is as aroma. Palate is light-to-medium bodied with slightly sticky texture, lively carbonation (lightly stinging) and finish as taste with mildly bitter ending. Overall, above average appearance but everything else is one dimensional and not very interesting. But, not offensive. Dear Zet, we will miss you and your lovable, quirky habits, tastes and nature.
Milwaukee's Best Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Rubbing alcohol. If you want a stiff beer, with rubbing alcohol taste here you go. My brothers answer to prozac. Cheap and best bang for the buck to get feeling ripe
Milwaukee's Best Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);This is canned, liquid regret. All the off flavors of a malt liquor without the ABV oomph, and barely cheaper than a 40 of whatever swill. No redeeming qualities here. Avoid!
Milwaukee's Best Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Served from 24 oz can into shaker glass. A large frothy white head drops slowly with moderate lacing. Color is clear straw with tons of streaming carbonation. Aroma is mild -- lightly toasted malt, clean water. Mouthfeel is medium with a dry finish and noticeable alcohol. Flavor of malt sweetness and a little more hop presence than others of this style. Overall: it is average for the Ice beer category. The alcohol presence gives more of a harsh malt-liquor presence than I care for.

Milwaukee's Best Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Can purchased in downtown Colon, Panama. Yes, I had to go all the way to Panama to find a 12 oz single. Pours a clear gold color with a white head and good retention. Lots of carbonation. Spots of lacing. Light corn nose. Very little flavor overall. Tastes like a corn lager with a slight booze finish. Crisp mouthfeel. Very malt liquor like. Better than a bitter IPA.
Milwaukee's Best Ice;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Not bad for a ice beer at all. It gets the job done, doesn't taste bad by any means. Gives a nasty hangover if you are not careful with it. Good for one or two cheep drinks but I wouldn't recommend going to a party and trying to enjoy it. Something to give a shot if your low on cash or just wants a cheep ice brew with a meal.

Meister Brau Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Just about as bad as Meister Brau regular. Bad flavor, bad aroma, bad feeling in my stomach. If you see this beer on sale just keep on moving, buy something else.

Magnum;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);The aroma is not distinctive in any way but sweet. The appearance is yellow with a thin head after the initial burst of gas. The taste is Miller High Life with an extra helping of corn. The body is too light for a beer pushing 5.6% ABV. Not awful but not satisfying.
Magnum;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Malt Liquor;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);24 oz. can from the local Walgreens. Which I picked up because I’m a nerd who likes ticking. Pours a clear pale yellow color with a somewhat thick white head on it. Nose is super sweet, with some corn and subtle testicle elements. Not perfectly fresh testicles, but maybe a couple hours after a shower. Not that disgusting ball funk, but just a subtle hint of it. Taste is a bit sickly sweet, much as I would imagine testicle candy would be.

Probably chemically induced. Nose is skunky, mild grass, honey, not offensive. Taste is corn water, old cereal, cardboard, hydrogen peroxide. If desperate, it could be drinkable. Solid choice perhaps for Edward 40 Hands.

Southpaw Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Yellow, musty and bland. Think dog’s paw, wet from walking on the grass after rain.
Southpaw Light;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Straw color, lots of head. Tastes of nothing but metal and water, I think bottled water would have a better flavor.
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Trying to do a sober rest of August after abusing my liver far too much the past couple months (and probably for the past few years to be honest) so I grabbed a 12 pack of these at Walmart for the nice low price of $5.47. Honestly? Not really that bad. It tastes pretty much like Miller Lite until the finish (when it just falls off tht pallet completely... like malt flavored seltzer). Dunno if I'll buy another 12, but I don't think these will go to waste. Sláinte.
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle from Harrahs Casino on 11 October 2017. I did not realise that this was such a low alcohol beer until I bought it and read the label. This certainly wasn't the worst low alcohol beer that I have had and it actually didn't taste too bad.
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Bottle.It poured clear gold with a thin white head. Light malt aroma with notes of artificial corn. It is mildly bitter.
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Not that bad beery/malty aroma but very hollow and empty in flavor, no reason to have again.
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"Pours clear golden, not much head. Aroma delivers wan malty and hoppy notes. Flavor is barely like a beer at all - malty, a teeny bit fruity and hoppy, but not beer-ish. Mouthfeel features barely acceptable body and fizz. When will anyone brew an acceptable ""near beer""? Probably after the Detroit Lions win the Super Bowl."
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);Ok for a non alcohol brew...but i must ask the question...what is the point...have a beer or drink water!
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);I love everything about this non-alcoholic beer--the refreshing light taste, the low 55 calories, the low carbs.
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);"...so i guess it’s not quite as bad as other miller products (not as skunky)...but why bother. have a water."""
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz bottle, thanks to Chudwick, the NA King. Date on bottle reads NOV0314. Pours a clear golden color, with a rocky white head that fizzes loudly. Thin white head retains, which is impressive. Kind of pretty good lace.. Bigger bubbles of carbonation in the glass. Nose is bread, corn. Flavor is bread, corn, water. Taste has kind of a bite to it going down, a little rough. Very mild sweet taste, but pretty much no taste at all to this. Tastes kind of like rough-textured water. Wet plain white bread. Lighter body. Rough texture. Light to moderate carbonation. Bit of a tart acidic bite in the aftertaste. Not very satisfying at all for me. Challenging to drink. Might convince someone craving a beer that perhaps they don’t actually like beer at all. Not outright disgusting, but I didn’t end up finishing the last bit. What’s the point.
Miller Sharps;Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States;Low / No Alcohol Beer;Miller Brewing Company (Molson Coors);12oz bottle into a glass. Nose is grain or old corn. Sip adds floral notes and high life light-esk qualities. Decent.
Stone Pale Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone Brewing;Backlog, Bottles over the years, and probably on draft. Pours a lightly hazy golden with a medium fast receding top. Notes are pine, ash, grapefruit resin, sweeter malt, and grape sugar. A bit sweet and malty for me especially compared to other beers from Stone and the lower percent. Light to medium bodied.
Stone Pale Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone Brewing;This has been on my wish list for a couple years now, but did not get around to it because a little pricey and tried other things. Grabbed a single to sample first, but worth $2 a beer IMO.....barely though. Could be at the top of my APA list, right up there with Stoudts. I find the two very similar all-around. A murky medium orangish color. Aroma of pine and citrus, but not as strong as their IPA. Flavor is well balanced....leaning slightly towards the hops vs. malt. What I really like about these is the mouthfeel, very smooth, crisp, refreshing, however you want to describe it. Something that I will return to for sure!
Stone Pale Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone Brewing;Poured from bottle a golden copper with a white head. Aroma: citrus, grapefruit, biscuity malt, candy orange notes. Taste: citrus, grapefruit, peach, carmael, mild candy orange and mild biscuity malt flavours. Thin to medium bodied. Mild sweetness followed by mild bitterness finish. Moderate carbonation. Easy to drink and a fantastic Pale Ale.
Stone Pale Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone Brewing;"From Jun 2007 Purchased as part of a mixed 6pack from Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins. This pours from 12oz bottle a hazy orange amber with a medium sized head of foam that dissipated quickly leaving a few islands and it has some nice lacing. The smell is on the sweet side. I get caramel malt with just a touch of hops and some fruit. The taste on first sip has some good malty sweetness up front with a solid backbone of hop bitterness that comes in about midway through and dominates the finish but it's not overly aggressive and I'm liking it. A few more sips in and I'm beginning to realize that this APA is all about balance and I start to notice a fruitiness in the flavour that I mentioned in the nose. Maybe cherry? Dang, this is certainly a drinkable example of the style and now I wish I had bought at least a 6pack. Oh well, I can cure that on my next trip to the Fort. ;^) Bottom line: This a great APA that I can highly recommend. See some grab some."
Stone Pale Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone Brewing;Pretty surprised by this beer the first time I tried in back in 2011 at a Flying Saucer stone tasting in 2011. Considering the modus operandi of stone, the subtlety of this beer, its balance between caramelly sweetness and citrus hops, it quite nice.
Stone Pale Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone Brewing;Bottle, from US. Backlog entry. Entering my historic scores for US beers whilst visiting New York. No tasting notes kept, just rating.

Stone Pale Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone Brewing;Kuparinen, punertavanruskea kirkkaahko olut, joka ei vaahtoa juuri lainkaan. Tuoksussa humalaa, havuisuutta, sitruksisuutta sekä jokin - ei niin miellyttävä - sivutuoksu, josta en saa päähäni mitä se on. Maku mielenkiintoinen yhdistelmä karamellista makeutta ja greippistä katkeroa. Katkeran greippinen jälkimaku. Keskiasteinen suutuntuma ja sopivasti hiilihappoja.
Stone Pale Ale;Escondido, California, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Stone Brewing;Pours a murky amber with a thin white head which is gone quickly........aroma is slight earth, sweet malts......taste is medium mouthfeel, earth, bitterness tailing off into a slight metallic finish.
Stone Smoked Porter;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;Bottle share at the Euston Tap in 2012. Black with a tan head. Aroma of peated malt, smoked fish, dark grains, rye bread and Christmas cake. Super smooth and fullbodied. Fantastic smokiness mixed with roast malt and coffee. Could just have been that little bit more strong on the linger.
Stone Smoked Porter;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;On tap at the San Diego j street Taproom, this Rauchbier is representative of the style. The Smoky malts come through strong with enough body and hops to support the powerful flavour.
Stone Smoked Porter;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;On tap at Stone Brewing Berlin. Dark brown, medium tan head. Smoke, some wood in aroma. Roasted malts, chocolate, bit watery, too thin. Bitter finish. Light to medium bodied. Expected way more, I guess one more candidate for re-rate.
Stone Smoked Porter;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;OK.....about a week after I tried what is/was possibly my favorite non-imperial porter (Avery New World), I sample something that is quite possibly better. This is one damn good porter! Would have liked to grab a 6'er to sample (if they even have them) rather than just one 22oz. One day in the near future I will have to test these again side by side, but for now I'll just call it a draw. This has a similar super dark brown/coffee black appearance with mocha head. Not super coffee-flavored like some robust/mocha porters, which I prefer a good balance of chocolate and hops as well rather than mostly coffee. This has a smokey flavor though, but not overwhelming as well. Hard to tell where the flavor comes from...I am thinking aged a bit in oak perhaps? Smooth and crips mouthfeel. My first sample from Stones, heard great things about them and they have backed it up so far. Can't wait to try some more!
Stone Smoked Porter;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;Piana drobna trwała, zdobi szkło. Kolor ciemny pod światło rubin klarowne.

Stone Smoked Porter;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;From May 2007 Purchased from Wilbur's Liquors in Ft Collins This pours from 22oz bottle(room temp) a very dark brown with reddish hues. There's a huge billowy offwhite head of foam that shrinks down to a solid layer and stays for the entire session. The smell I'm getting is chocolate and roasted malt . The taste on first sip is very chocolaty with good roasted malt flavour and a touch of coffee. Initially, I thought it was going to lean towards the sweet side but the roasted malt bitterness gives it a good dry taste. Further sips in and I can taste *some* smoke but it's lightly done and it really meshes well with the other flavours and makes it quite smooth and quite drinkable. The body is medium, the carbonation is on the light side and the finish, for me, ends on a somewhat semi sweet note. Very nice. Bottom line: This is quite different from Alaskan Brewery's interpretation of a Smoked Porter, which is much more vigorously smokeie, but it's also quite good. I recommend it!
Stone Smoked Porter;Escondido, California, United States;Porter - Smoked;Stone Brewing;From bomber at home. Dark brown with reddish edges and a full tan head. Smoky dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee. Medium body. Lingering roasty, dry finish. Excellent.

New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle into glass. Pale yellow. Thin white head. Nice wheat aroma and taste. Some interesting honey citrus hints.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);After notes of the orange peel and slightly of the coriander. Good carbonation.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Twelve ounce bottle. Taste the bread, taste the yeast, and a fair slice of lemon. The taste is alright, and the palate, but I think that they could turn down the carbonation.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours a bright yellow with a white foam head. Aroma is orange, honey, coriander, and other fruits. Flavor is sweet wheat malts, orange, and spices. Crisp. Enjoyable.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A bready and a little yeasty wheat beer. A nice little blend of spices but not too much.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Not generally a fan of this style, but this one makes the cut. Could use a little more body and flavor...but maintains that light summery feel. Smooth and crisp mouthfeel. Flavor of wheat, coriander, citrus, and some other light fruits. I hadn't read the reviews, and coincidentally paired with a spicy Thai green bean coconut soup.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);citrusy, wheatabix, wheaty. good palate, citrus hop nose. nice quaffer that i'd get again.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);From Jun 2007 Purchased at Liquor Shed in Casper. This pours from 12oz bottle(best by 10 Aug 07) a clear light gold with a good head of foam that shrinks quickly to some islands in the middle of my glass. Good lacing though.. The smell is fruity first, of wheat second. I get a lot of orange in the nose. The taste has orange and other citrus flavour up front followed by some wheat and coriander. Put them all together and well...it doesn't seem to work for me at all. I can't say much more than that other than I won't be buying this again and the other 5 bottles of it that I have will be tough to finish.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Pours a pale golden color. About three fingers white heads. Thick and rocky head . Very clear. Softly carbonated. Excellent retention, good lacing. Aroma is crackery. Coriander, green apple and honey. Touch of orange peel. Taste is sweet, very lightly bitter, perhaps from the spice. Orange peel, coriander, light green apple. Also touch of honey. Mouthfeel is light, a touch wet. Watery. Overall, it’s decent. It won’t knock your socks off. But it’ll do on a hot summer day. I’d certainly drink it again, but I won’t be buying it.
New Belgium Sunshine Wheat;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Wheat Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Draft. Clear yellow color white head. Aroma of peppery citrus. Taste is lightly tart lightly spiced. OK.
New Belgium Fat Tire;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Fat Tire's signature swathe of biscuity/toasty malt is well tempered with gentle hopping. The fairly voluminous head lingers -- a perfect white muffintop on a dark golden/amber body. Will it change your life? Maybe. Will you enjoy it? Yes you will.
New Belgium Fat Tire;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);473ml can. Clear copper with a foamy off-white head.

New Belgium Fat Tire;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottled. Half hazy yellow body, small white head. The aroma has peach and the taste has malt and wheat, some orange.
New Belgium Fat Tire;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Can from LCBO, nice amber pour white head. Brisk fresh aroma of sweet and acidic citrus, baked apple sweetness and pine plays into citrusy hop taste profile and bready-fruity body. Has a kind of Pale Ale attitude and some 'warmth' to it and also a slightly Belgian Blonde Ale yeast characteristic, or maybe that's the spiciness of the hops? Really nice!
New Belgium Fat Tire;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);I've always been pretty fond of Fat tire. It's delicious from a can, which is usually the worst way served. I would always buy a 6-pack if there were other options.
New Belgium Fat Tire;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Review based on the BJCP2015 guidelines (style 24B). Can 35.5 cl - batch 190218091T (BBF 23.FEB.2020). AROMA: low malt aroma with slight caramel notes. APPEARANCE: light amber color and clear. medium off-white head with average retention. TASTE: medium-low to low malt flavor with a mono-dimensional caramel-like character. no esters nor hops detected. medium-low bitterness with a dry finish. faint metallic and yeasty note. PALATE: medium-low body with medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: why does the can of this beer say ""Belgian Style Ale""? it resembles more a poor amber ale."
New Belgium Fat Tire;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Red Ale / Intl Amber Ale;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);UNREAL. What happened to the origin recipe?

Clear pale golden, lots of bubbles, small white head. Crisp grasses in the nose. Flavor is grasses, bread, cracker, grain, glue. Simple, drinkable, but not great.
New Belgium Blue Paddle;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);A refreshing version of a Pilsner beer. Still has a subtle Pilsner taste but goes down smooth and easy.
New Belgium Blue Paddle;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);(12oz bottle, part of a New Belgium mix 12-pack) AROMA: soft euro pils nose, noble hops and grain, unripe stone fruit, peach skin, leans towards the german style APPEARANCE: medium golden yellow, bright and clean, thin white head TASTE: grainy malt upfront, barley/wheat, bready, minimal sweetness, earthy, dry hay, once again seems to lean towards the german style, dry middle and straight forward pils hoppiness, PALATE: grain forward but otherwise nicely balanced, medium light body, quite dry for a lager/pils. OVERALL: not a great euro/german pils, but not bad. decent amount of grain flavor with enough hops/bitterness to make it interesting. Tastes like a local pils that you might get in a german village.
New Belgium Blue Paddle;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Purchase in a variety pack from my local Stater Brothers. average white head on top of a clear golden body. There's a cool sweetness to the smell, similar to a line but not citrusy. The Taste is smooth and mild and delightful on pallet. This may be the best beer from New Belgium

Bitterness is light with a honey note to balance. M: Light and smooth textured with soft, coating carbonation. O: Very nice hoppy pils. If they sold this on its own I'd buy a 6 pack."
New Belgium Blue Paddle;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Clear gold, white head. Notes of grass, hay, pils malts, hint of fruit loops. Good palate. Draft at World of Beer in Rockville, Maryland. Also, I don't know why they listed it at retired. Had it about a week ago.
New Belgium Blue Paddle;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Pilsener - Czech / Svetlý;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);From Nov 2005 poured from bottle(room temp) a medium clear gold with a medium sized head that dissipated quickly leaving just a fine ring around the edge of the glass. The smell is dominated by hops but there *is* a sweet aroma of malt as well. The taste is a very nice balance between the hops and malt and has that *pilsner* taste that I've experienced with the better European examples. This is one great session beer and I thoroughly recommend it.
New Belgium Abbey Dubbel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Not even close to the real thing. Too thin. Watery. No head. Unfulfilling. Stick with real Belgian dubbels.

T: Plum and clove; red apple and black licorice; medium-low sweetness; some toast; bitterness is medium-low, with a bit of mossy hop flavor; finish is dried pineapple and more red apple and clove. M: Medium body with high carbonation; finish is medium-dry. O: Really a stunning dubbel; other than the small head with low retention, this beer really is spot on for the style."
New Belgium Abbey Dubbel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle, 10C. Clear deep brown with a beige coat that hangs around. 3+ No sediment at all visible at the bottom of the bottle, hmm. Aroma of brown bread, dried banana, cloves. And so it tastes. The finish - which makes it - is drying with spices and gentle but sufficient bitterness. Good.
New Belgium Abbey Dubbel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Backlog, Bottle, pours ruby red with a larger head. Nose and flavor of prunes, plum, candy sugar, caramel malt, bubblegum, and other sweet fruits. Thin bodied and sweet. I'll stick to the real Belgian dubbels.
New Belgium Abbey Dubbel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);on tap at brewery in Fort Collins. pretty perfect abbey dubbel - loved every sip
New Belgium Abbey Dubbel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Quite a great abbey beer, resembles a lot of the Belgian dubbel bier taste. Dubbel has always been a favorite for me since its slightly sweet body, with enough maltiness and smooth mouth feel. This abbey is slightly lighter than the authentic Trappist Dubbels I had before, but the malt scent and caramel sweetness are definitely there. Great golden body with a rocky head, I would say, its quite a great beer.
New Belgium Abbey Dubbel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle, from City Hops.

Dark amber brown pour with a foamy, mocha head that fades slow. Enticing aroma of dark roasted Belgian malts, molasses, dark fruit, and earthy hop profile. The mouthfeel is medium and smooth. The taste is sweet with a peppery bite behind it.Lingering spicy finish. This is a nice US take on the style.
New Belgium Abbey Dubbel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Dubbel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);The pour ia a gourgous deep reddish color. Nice tan foamy head. A nice toasty aroma. The taste has a strong roasted flavor. This is a very nice Dubbel. Well done.

New Belgium Trippel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Tripel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"I was looking forward to trying this. Ive tried other Belgium ales and they were good. But........... This one has all the hops and bitterness and dish soap foam for an entire state. YUCK!!!! ANOTHER HORRIBLE ATTEMPT TO TRY TO SELL GARBAGE AS ""CRAFTIE BEER"". I couldnt believe how bad this was. Worse than the ""great"" USA craftie IPA. Yuck, I will never buy this swill again."
New Belgium Trippel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Tripel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);Bottle. Amber color, mostly clear. Sweet but clean aroma. Good. Doesn't taste very strong.
New Belgium Trippel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Tripel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);This is a good beer....not great. I think it's a little weak for the style, but there is some nice flavor....just wish that it was a little heavier and fuller. Tastes of wheat and tropical fruit. Clear yellow-light orange appearance. Decent feel. Worth the try, but sticking with the Ranger IPA for their standard bombers that are being distributed here in FL.
New Belgium Trippel;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Tripel;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);From a Bottle to a Glass. Pours a clear Amber color with minimal creamy head.

New Belgium Saison Harvest Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);From Oct 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle(best by Jan 26-07) a clear light gold with a very small head of foam that dissipated almost immediately....just a little bit of lacing hugging the side of the glass for a while and that disappeared shortly after. The smell is mostly fruit and yeast. The taste has good malty notes up front with yeasty and fruity flavours following closely behind. Fruitwise, I sense mostly apricot and plum wsith *some* slight notes of clove and a bit of funk. The body *is* a bit on the thin side for the style but over all....I like it. Bottom line: It's the only Saison that I can get in town and it's a pretty good one.Give it a try.
New Belgium Saison Harvest Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);More Belgian Ale than saison, to me asnyway. Fruity esters and a little dusty. Dry finish. Not bad, but not a huge fan.
New Belgium Saison Harvest Ale;Fort Collins, Colorado, United States;Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette;New Belgium Brewing Company (Lion Co. - Kirin Holdings);"Bottle at my in-laws. After a long day of air travel followed by a long drive, I needed a beer. And it seemed that I had two options: A Leinenkugel summery shandy (from last summer, or maybe much earlier), or a Sam Adams Winter Lager (Christmas spices!). I was going to go hunt around for an old bud light or something, when my father in law pulled a couple of these out of the downstairs fridge. I doubt I’ve ever been so happy to see the words ""New Belgium."" Now, it’s a not a great saison--probably not even something you’d call a good one. Sort of classic American saison, esters forward, a bit sweet, yeasty, sticky with alcohol. But it was a real beer, and under the circumstances I was real happy to have it."

Left Hand Wake Up Dead Imperial Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Left Hand Brewing Company;Tasted from a bomber and from a 16-oz can, and it's hard to determine taste differences between them (though the loud fwwwiiiipp when opening the nitro can is quite impressive compared to the slighter sound of the bottle opening). Chocolate, smoke, licorice and coffee make for one big aroma. Taste is heavily sweet though not quite over the edge. You can't convince me that the hop bill is large enough to warrant 45 IBUs though there is a bit of dryness, overwhelmed by sweet, in the finish. A heavy lift overall, would be good with dessert and a definite candidate for splitting our savoring over an hour or so.

Left Hand Wake Up Dead Imperial Stout;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Stout - Imperial;Left Hand Brewing Company;"Can. 10.2%. Best before 19.07.19. As ’Left Hand Wake Up Dead Nitro’. Pours a dark brown, bordering black, with a lasting, creamy, light tan head. Great lacing. Sweetish, roasted, fruity aroma. Spicy/herbal hint. Slightly dusty as it warms, and the fruity note becomes a bit overripe. Further warming brings out hints of whisky/wood and barbecue deep down. Flavour is roasted, with a liquorice bitterness mixed with an alcohol note. Hint of wood. Light overripe fruit as it warms. Further warming birings out a remote chocolate note. (Liquorice) bittter finish. Roasted. Alcohol burn. Lingering grassy, green apple note. Soft palate, obviously. Overall good, but I expected more from this though; I think it lacks some notes in both aroma and flavour, and the alcohol is a tad unbalanced. 31.03.19."

Left Hand Jackmans Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Left Hand Brewing Company;Originally rated on 12/18/2008. Jackman APA poured a hazy amber body with very little carbonation, or head to speak of. Slight floral hop aroma, and some malts in there.

Left Hand Jackmans Pale Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Pale Ale - American / APA;Left Hand Brewing Company;This beer was not one of my favorites from Left Hand. I don’t think it was in the league with some of the other pale ales out there. Maybe I just prefer my American Pale Ales to be supersmooth, so this seemed a little hoppier than it should, slightly on the bitter end but nothing like an IPA or anything. Just had a lingering aftertaste that wasn’t all sweet, a little bit piney. Pours a copper-amber color with medium density. Slightly better than average.

Clear dark brown with a thin beige cap. Spicy and malty nose like nutmeg and cinnamon with an odd candle-wax tone and earthy sweet maltiness.

Slightly boozy sweet finish.

Do get an alcohol smell in it as well. T-- Lots of spice in this puppy. Nutmeg, cinimmon, clove, candied sugar, orange, and on and on and on. M-- Spices then the alcohol in the mouthfeel. it is OK at start but gets tiresome. D-- for a $5 dollar growler I am not complaining but it is a tiresome beer. Too much going on and early on too spice driven. Once it gets air the spices calm down a bit. Good effort but one 750 is enough.

Left Hand Snow Bound Winter Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Flavored - Other;Left Hand Brewing Company;"Brown with red tinges, and a modest but promising head. Smells like a damned shaker of nutmeg, though, which worries me greatly. Snow Bound tastes like a beer you’d want to drink exactly twice during the winter; any more and your blood might turn into egg nog. Sneaky potency, though, as the only sign of the beers elevated ABV is the growing fuzziness of my brain. Most assuredly an after-dinner beer, perfect for drifting off on the couch as the Lions lose again. (12/7/08)"
Left Hand Deep Cover Brown Ale;Longmont, Colorado, United States;Brown Ale;Left Hand Brewing Company;"I liked this beer a lot. Wasn’t anything to write home about, but a very good overall beer, especially if looking for a ""lighter"" dark beer. Appears a medium-dark brown, a little darker than amber, but has a thin density. Not very syrupy at all like some of the other brown ales or honey beers. Still has a good sweet taste like caramel and malts...very little hops in the flavor but just enough to notice."

Foggy Bottom Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Draft at Norfolk airport 2003. Typical golden lager color with a small head that tries to last. Aroma is not much, maybe some spicy honey. Taste is a nice balance of lemony-bitter herbs and honey malt. Light-bodied and watery with a good hop tingle. Not my first choice, but quite often a good substitute for the ales that were tapped out.
Foggy Bottom Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;This beer pours a slightly cloudy golden color, with a thin white head.

Foggy Bottom Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;(12 oz bottle: Obtained 06-May-06 in trade with Otter, thanks Jeremy!) An old favorite from when I lived in the DC area and commuted daily to the Foggy Bottom area of DC, this is a nice standby beer. It’s balanced, flavorful, enjoyable and under appreciated. Malty, caramely, moderately sweet, and mildly bitter flavor has a pleasant toastiness and some honey toward the finish. Body and carbonation are medium. The nose is noticeably more grainy and less sweet or toasty than the flavor. Medium-dark amber color is only a little hazy, and the light-tan head pours to half an inch before settling to a wide ring. Only spotty lacing though. Too bad that the resurrection of this historic District brewing tradition is over because this is, err, was a really nice Maërzen.
Foggy Bottom Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Poured an amber to copper color with a decent initial head that laced ok. The aroma was of caramel. The flavor was caramel with some hops (somewhat like an amber ale), and as it warmed a dry spicey-hops (not typical marzen spicing, more peppery) type finish. Dry mouthfeel was the signature of this one and it didn’t remind me much of a marzen style beer, like the label says.
Foggy Bottom Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Bottle. Pretty decent lager, though pretty standard. Too bad it’s now retired, I just discovered it at the store the other day.

Foggy Bottom Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Yet another beer popular in Washington (obviously because of the name, for one), which is made far, far away from here. Were local breweries bought out in spades here recently? Despite popular confusion, there is a difference between Foggy ale and lager, though the taps don’t always say which it is. This was the Lager, Timberlake’s, Washington DC. Slightly creamy, not terribly easy to drink, but retains the hops. Almost like a poor imitation of the Brooklyn Lager style. It’s often seen as the better option in pubs, but I’m not so sure.
Foggy Bottom Lager;Utica, New York, United States;Pale Lager - Intl / Premium;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Tap at the Froggy Bottom. Nice amber color with a white head. We got a whole pitcher for about 7 bucks. Not a top beer but definitely something I like better than most of the macros around. Malty flavor, big on malts not much hops.
Summer Fog Wheat Ale;Utica, New York, United States;Wheat Ale;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;This was real clear and absolutely none of the flavor you'd want in a wheat beer. Might as well drink Schlitz.

Autumn Fogg Maerzen;Utica, New York, United States;Märzen / Oktoberfest Bier;F.X. Matt Brewing Company;Dark amber, almost brown color with a decent foam head. The aroma is a funky malt smell, that is not all that pleasing. Flavor is likewise nothing that gets my engine running. It has a very faint hint of flavor beyond standard lager fair.

Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Reddish copper with a thick white head. Bread, lightly sweet, malty, earth. Full smooth body. Easy.
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Can. Deep amber in colour, with a slight, off-white, head. Caramel aplenty, slightly bready malts, a touch of leafy hop and slightly bitter finish. So so.
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;"Can labelled ""Tetley's Smooth Flow"" with ABV = 3.6%. Poured a clear dark amber with 1cm of beige froth that retained very well and laced poorly. No carbonation after the nitro was expended. Aroma of sweetish caramel and toffee. Taste is quite sweet caramel; no real bitterness. Light body. Smooth with a thin mouthfeel and a creamy finish."
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Not much of a nose, neither malt nor hops - reminiscent of a cheap lager. Thin and uninteresting on the tongue. The creamy, nitro effect is positively terrible in a bitter.
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;21/10/2018. Can of the Original Bitter, 3.6% abv, from a skanky mini-market in Skegness run by a very rude chap indeed. The buying experience was marginally worse than the beer. Poured clear amber with a foamy off-white head. Aroma malt, toffee, fruit, berries and metal. Medium plus sweetness, moderate but slightly unpleasant bitterness. Moderate body, slight oily and watery texture, soft carbonation. Metallic, berry bitterness to finish. Just fair.
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;440ml can of Original from B&M Darlington. Amber colour, off-white foam head leaving some lacing and malty yeasty aroma. Taste is malt, toffee, yeasty with earthy bitterness. Light to medium bodied, soft carbonation, dry tangy bitter finish. OK.
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Can of Tetley's Smooth Ale from B&M, Team Valley, Gateshead. Amber coloured with a thick creamy head of foam. It has a floral, slight herbal fruity, toffee and malty flavour with slight sulphur notes on the creamy smooth finish. Not bad for the ABV.
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Smooth flow. Bready and lightly malty, a little bit of dry fruit flavour, smooth on the palate but the problem is the slightly metallic tang and the harsh bitterness.
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;Not a memorable beer, creamy white head , that laces but bitter aftertaste what doesnt leave wanting more
Tetleys Bitter / Original / Smoothflow (Can);Northampton, Northamptonshire, England;Bitter - Ordinary / Best;Carlsberg UK;440ml can into pint glass. As Tetley's Smooth Flow. Widgety gush leads to a still golden bronze beer with a two finger tightly packed creamy head. Excellent lacing. Smells of caramel lollies being eaten in the next room. Smooth texture, toffee malt taste. Short finish. Standard English lunchtime pub bitter.

Moylans Ryan Sullivans Imperial Stout;Novato, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;65cl Bottle @ Beergium, Le Roeulx, Belgium. Black colour with a thin tan head.

Moylans Ryan Sullivans Imperial Stout;Novato, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;Aroma is quite sweet though, chocolate, coffee and an aura of slightly burnt malts. Taste also carries already mentioned chocolate notes, a wee hint of licorice and burnt coffee. Actually, the burnt coffee notes almost turns acidic. That plays well with the earlier, sweeter notes. Finish is light ashy and dry. As solid as it gets, and a good counterweight towards todays modern pastry stouts.
Moylans Ryan Sullivans Imperial Stout;Novato, California, United States;Stout - Imperial;Moylans Brewery & Restaurant;Boozy, caramelly, flat, disappointing. Comparing to the Cycle imperial stouts tried at the same panel - woeful.

Pitch black coloured, medium sized brown head, alcohol and mild chocolate in the nose.

DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Rated from old notes. Unique, almost creamy taste. Lots of caramel and malt. A dark lager with a smooth, rich taste. Slightly more body would improve the rating.
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Pours ruby red with a tan head. Smells of roasted malt, spicy, some caramel, some chocolatey hints. Tastes of roasted malt, clove, some spicy hints, dark fruit on the finish.
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;12oz bottle (variety pack). Pours a dark amber brown with a three finger rocky ivory head. Smell is a toffeeish malt, with an underlying roastiness and light spice. The taste is malt and caramel with a coffee background. It is very smooth with very little aftertaste or bitterness.
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Medium brown with an enormous rocky, off-white head. Heavgy, sweet aroma of pineapple and banana, along with a slight clove spiciness. Cloyingly sweet flavor of honey. Tiny bit of hoppy dryness in the finish is not hearly enough to balance the sweetness. Medium body, lots of carbonation.
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;ah good stuff light brown colour, small head hints of toffee/coffee, seemed a tad thin, but fairly good stuff
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Retired? Whatever. Pours a thin brown body with a nice head. Aroma is malt dominated with caramel and toffee. Maybe a hint of bread. Flavor is the same and it’s pretty thin. Where are the hops? I still enjoyed it but it’s nothing exciting.
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Hazy mahogany glow offering a vast off-white head. Sweet malty nose of mature berries, raisins and apples. Fruited dark malts linger along the roasty ones, procuring a nutty and brown sugar sweet feel that is taken aback by a considerable metallic side, contrasting with the sweet finish there while the little hop character there is stays shy and stale. Medium bodied, soft carbonation for DeGroens. Maybe not in top shape either.
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;This is okay. I kind of has a malty chocolatey finish and for some reason it was half the variety case (maybe they wanted to dump it before retiring it). Aroma has caramel and malt tones and the taste has the same with a wet finish to it. Its not a spectacular beer but I don’t mind drinking a lot of this one as there is nothing I find repellent here. I don’t detect the sourness that previous raters noted any where or any acidity. This must be a pretty good bottle. (Brewskies in East Stroudsburg)
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;This is an ok Dunkel. Malty, caramel, and nutty flavors. Finishes smooth, dry, and clean.
DeGroens Dunkles;Dover, Delaware, United States;Dark Lager - Dunkel / Tmavý;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;This one poured all head (6 fingers of head compared to 1 finger of liquid). Poured a dark, cloudy brown color with the humongous tan head. Aromas of yeast, dark fruits, bread and earth. Bready, malty and spicy tasting. Slightly sour. May be past its prime.
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"Transfer review. Nice transparent straw color with a rather thin, white wispy head. For the nose and on the palate this beer seems more like a Czech pils than a German variety. I have to assume it was intended to be German as all of their beers are in that tradition. Nonetheless, Saaz lovers will appreciate this one. Big hop character, in both nose and on the palate, with some herbal, earthy and ""root"" flavors. Very dry, exceptionally dry, is that cotton in my mouth? No, seriously, it’s an excellent pils if you’re looking for Saaz love, and highly recommended overall to any drinker. Possible transition beer for BMC folks? Just maybe."
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Pours gold with a white head. Smells of dry pilsner malt, apples, perfumy. Tastes sweet and earthy with some floral grassy hints on the finish.
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;12 oz bottle-rating #500!-Pours a cloudy golden color w/a slight white head. Has some hop bite to it, a lot more than I expect when I hear pilsner, maybe a little too much for me. Seemed kind of one dementional to me, kind of IPA ish. Could use some malt/sweetness in the finish to balance it out. Not bad, but it left a lot to be desired
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Bottle sampled. Pours golden/copper with an average size white head. Aroma of palt malts, citrus, and grassy hops. The flavor is slightly sweet, grain, and a citrusy bitter finish.
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Bottle from State Line. Deep gold pour with 1-finger white head. Aroma is bready pale malt, some hopcitrus. Tastes malty, with some mid-palate apricot, and a smooth hopcitric finish.
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"12oz bottle. Pours a cloudy, medium golden color; white head with fine-bubbled lacing. Slightly vegetal (cabbage?) aroma, hints of sugar and citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel: lively carbonation; wet malts and candy sugar; slightly creamy and vegetal; drinkable, but not terribly pleasant. Hints of sugar and bitterness in the finish."
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;12oz bottle. Clear and filtered. Golden hued. Spotty white head. Typical grainy bready cereal nose. Initially dry with an odd smokey flavor. Almost meaty? Nice dry finish. Odd, but fuller than most pilsners.
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;From a 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date, blurb on the back label, sampled at a cooler cellar temperature in a pilsener glass. Poured a very slightly hazy amberish orange with a foamy white head that settled into a thin sudsy lacing. Aromas of lemon honey and soap, spicy and herbal, and sweet grainy malts. Good, moderate carbonation and a crisp, hop dry, rough medium bodied mouthfeel. A pretty hoppy pils, spicy and herbal bitterness, a sharp bitterness at the start of the taste, soft fruity, sugary pilsener malts, and a dry hop, malty finish. The most hopped up pilsener I’ve tried, not sure if I like, makes it a bit rough in palate, doesn’t have the smooth drinkability with the dry clean finish one expects in a pilsener.
DeGroens Pils;Dover, Delaware, United States;Pilsener / Pils / Pilsner;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"Orangey yellow in color, more orange hues than your average pilsner. Very generous initial head, great retention, solid lacing, a pretty nice looking product (although those pilsner steady stream of rising bubbles weren’t there). The aroma was caramel (pilsner?), light tea bags, some honey. The flavor was all of that, again more caramel than I’d expect in a pilsner, strong bitter hop touch, although not overly grassy. This thing is hopped like an IPA, rather original in that regard, but not really my cup of tea (or tea bags). Mouthfeel was moderate for the style, carbonated, but not overly so."""

DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Murky yellow orange pour. A little something missing off the taste. A bit sweet, some citrus, lemons and oats. Rated 2/19/03
DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;12oz bottle (variety pack). Poured a hazy golden color topped by a dense, creamy white head. The aroma is strong bready yeast and banana, with hops and a touch of cloves. The taste is light and fruity with a touch of yeast. Very well done with a light zesty finish leaving the lightest hint of bitterness.
DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;DeGroen’s Weizen is one of the better weissbiers that come close to the imported offerings of Paulaner, Hacker-Pschorr, etc. Very cloudy with deep yellow-orange hue. Contrasting white head rounds out the pleasing appearance of this beer. Nose is exceptionally fruity with the standard estery, bananna citrus components. Medium bodied. A full flavored weizen with no discernible imperfections.
DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Pours a hazy yellow with a white head. Smells of cloves, bananas, sweet malt. Tastes tarte with some weird rubbery hints on the finish.
DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Bottle. Poured a nice hazy orange color with yeasty orange aroma and a little carbonation. Flavor was a little funky, and not in a good way. Overly sweet malts and had an eggy aftertaste?? I’m guessing I just got an off bottle. Would give it another chance if I could try it on tap
DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"12 oz bottle-poured a cloudy orange color w/no head. Had no carbonation at all. This is a bad bottle; flat, no head, no flavor. I debated weather or not to rate it, but since I just bought it @ Shawan & it had no date of any kind on the bottle to alert me to a problem, I really didn’t feel too guilty about it. Be wary of this one if you see it there-or elsewhere. It has only had 5 ratings in the last 2 years; these bottles must be very old!"
DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Cloudy, pale body with a small, white head. Nose if dead on to style with banana and light clove and some dough. The flavor is light banana, light clove, bread and a touch of honey, fairly dry. Medium/light body is very soft with light carbonation, just a bit thin on the finish. Very quaffable. Well done.
DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;From a 12 oz. bottle, no freshness date, a blurb on the back label, sampled at cellar temperature in a weizen glass. Poured a slightly hazy, reddish golden orange with a foamy white head, decent retention, minimal amount of sticking. Aromas of banana and clove, fruity, spicy and wheat malty. Good, steady medium carbonation and a malty crisp, dryish, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel. For an American brew, a nice hefeweizen taste, the required banana and cloves, a good fruity, malty twang, lemon and spice, a soft hop bitterness towards the end and a dry yeasty, malty finish. A surprise, very enjoyable, easy, smooth drinkability, if you like hefe’s and don’t think Americans can do a decent one, then you need to try this. This is decent one, not a great one, but did the trick for me.
DeGroens Weizen;Dover, Delaware, United States;Weissbier - Hefeweizen;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Bottle sampled with Stegosaurus. Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a white head, aroma of wheat, bananas, spices. Flavor is carabonated, sweet, fruity, thin, ok brew, drinkable, but nothing great.

DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Aroma and flavor are both an nice blend of banana, caramel, and raisin. Creamy palate.
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Slightly hazed amber with a snall white head. Sweet aroma, sugary and fruity with an interesting hop component. The flavor is also very sweet, a bit atypical for thestyle but I still enjoed it. Medium-full body with a fruity/sweet aftertaste.
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Woops! What happened? Not a drain pour - or is it? Would say that something went way wrong here. Aaron suspected candy sugar, and I have to agree that it seemed present. With the ALT in the title I was expecting a certain tannic quality to be there somewhere or at least not be saturated with the type of swetness that did nothing to bring malt to mind. Didn’t taste infected, but perhaps an infection of another sort. What was being attempted here?
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Hazy amber with small off-white head. Aroma is sweet, candy sugar, caramel. Taste is very sweet, candy sugar, some caramel, lightly astringent. Sticky medium body with moderately high carbonation. I found this way too sweet, and in may ways it seemed like Belgium invading Germany -- not an alt like I’ve ever tasted.
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Murky, orange appearance with a small head. Fruity, sweet malt aroma that carried over to the taste. Well-hopped flavor added to the crispness and prevented this altbier from becoming too cloying. Clean finish.
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Deep hazy gold with a small white head that quickly disapates into a lacing around the rim. The aroma is of toasted malt,fruit and sweet malt. The flavor is tart,with a tangy malt character using a earthy hop chararcter and spice to lend to it's dry finish.
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;"Draught. Bartender noted it was sweeter than in previous years. Certainly sweet, but the body held up this sweetness nicely. I always thought of altbier as a lot dryer. This one emphasizes ""Fest"" more than ""Alt"". Think of it more as a Marzen."
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Draught - The beer had a nice copper hue with a slightly malty, hoppy aroma. Taste was crisp with a sweetness coming from the beer. Tasted great, but it wasn't a typical alt Beer.
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;dark orange colour, nice creamy head, beautiful lace, buttery, fruity aroma (peach), very smooth and sweet, lot of carbonation, long sour and fruity finish - complex and very good but don't tell me it's an altbier ?!?
DeGroens Altfest;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Altbier / Sticke Alt;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Tea colored, quite chill hazed with a nice frothy head, sheets of lace. Nose is earthy, malt, sweet and the start also has a malt sweetness to it. Top is light, the finish is lightly hopped, mildly carbonated, dry, drinkable, but not great.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;GABF 2004: Clear copper brown with a thin off-white head. Aroma is wonderfully malty sweet with bold caramel and smoked notes. Mildly sweet and smokey body has a nice balance and semi-dry, lingering smoke finish. This is a really good rauchbock.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;This was a really good smoked beer. The flavor was well balanced and malty up front, with a nice smoky finish. I could drink alot of this beer and recommend trying it if you see it.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Great smoked beer. Somewhat orangeish with an off white head. A bit sweet and malty, hints of tobacco with obvious peat smoked malt. Flavors match the taste, but I would even throw in a bit of caramel and toffee as it warmed. Would be awesome on a summer day out on the deck grilling up all the favorites. A perfect example for this style.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Sweet, slightly smoky aroma. Medium orange color, with a moderate head. Flavor is mostly smoked malt, with just enough hops to keep it on the malty end of balanced. Sweet and smokey, like a good smoked sausage. Slight alcohol taste. Not overpoweringly smoked, a great introduction to the style.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;A dark ambery-topaz beer with moderate head. A strong aroma of sweet smoke that lends perfect compliment to a smooth flavor. Decent amount of well presented malt. Much less sweet than most of DeGroen's bocks. And did I mention that it was smokey? A totaly excellent experience.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;This years (2004) offering is the best I have had so far. The aroma is a little more subtle, but still smoky. Smooth, leathery, smoky malt taste that is so true to the style. Unique without being offensive. If you like rauch beers, you will love this one. A must if you ever get the opportunity.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;IN-SANE! Massively smoky, like eating a side of bacon that sat in a smokehouse for a month. Outstanding, though the bockiness didn't shine through much. Moderately malty. This may be better than Schlenkerla Urbock!
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Smokey bacon aroma--brown and see-through. Good but less body than I had expected. Needs more malt, but it is one of the best rauchbiers that I have had that wasn't German and from Bamberg.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Very nice smoked malt with a smooth presentation. No one component is too overpowering of the rest... nice balance of flavor.
DeGroens Rauchbock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Smoked - Rauchbier;Baltimore Brewing Co.;I was really impressed with this one. The smoke doesn't overpower the sweet malts, thank god,thus leading to an eminently drinkable beer. This ones delicious. Much better than that Schlerenkerla ... or however you spell it... crap.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Slighlty hazy golden amber with a small off-white head. Very nice fruity malt nose, berries primarily. Flavor is also quite fruity, as with some other beers from these guys it is not really to style but it is still a decent beer. Medium body with a lingering fruity finish.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Cloudy, golden appearance with a fruity aroma that was reminiscent of ripe mangos. Lively carbonation fuels the fairly high abv. Short lived, malty finish.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Was rather puzzled by this one. The line up at DeGroens tends to the German side, if by just by name. Poor choice of malt is my speculation. Sweetness is there, but character and body that follows is not. Was a nice brew to a degree (and yes, Kathy, where DID the strawberry come from?). with this strength I would much rather be drinking another of their beers.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;By chance this made its seasonal debut last night when I visited the brewery. Hazy amber body with off-white head. Aroma is medium sweet, caramel, strawberry, biscuit. Taste is medium sweet, caramel, grain, and not much else until the finish, which has some alcohol, some cereal, and some astringency. Medium body, slightly sticky.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Light in color with a sugary aroma. Predominant alcohol-malt character. OK.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;This is a great maibock. Wow. Light gold in color. Nice white head. Clear, super crisp. Fruity aroma with pear, apple? Alcohol is nicely masked with great malting and then the hops zoom in. Fun beer if you can find it.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Update: 06/03. Big beautiful white head. When cold, all this shows is alcohol. Fruitiness comes out a bit as it warms up. Lighter and a bit less rich than I'd like in Maibock, but really pretty good. Old: See Venom's excellent description. Sampled at the brewery, where two construction workers were drinking this 6.8% brew out of 1 liter mugs. They had several. Fitting tribute to a fine beer, I thought.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Very light gold. Nice, thick head. Odd carbonation, tasted almost like it was nitro poured. Noticeable German hops give a slightly bitter backbone. Main flavor is a apple/peachy maltiness. Quite refreshing.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Golden straw sheen. Thin, dense white head. Tiny bubbled and restrained carbonation. Estery alcohol aroma mixed with spicy German hops, clean water and faint malts. Delicate yet in your face flavors of fruity alcohol, grainy malts and spicy hops. Medium bodied. Brash alcohol is not indicative of it's strength, but flexes its muscles here and there. Clean and well lagered. Adequate balance. Pear juice fruitiness. Finishes with a malty surge and alcohol smack. A good example.
DeGroens Maibock;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Bock- Heller Bock / Maibock;Baltimore Brewing Co.;A very attractive beer when poured into a glass. The aroma is malt driven. Flavors are mainly malty and sweet. A good hellerbock.
DeGroens Helles;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baltimore Brewing Co.;"Bright amber appearance with a large white head. Modest nose that imparted a doughy aroma. Up front, the taste was malty with a touch of caramel. Developed some hoppiness as it finished. Light-to-medium body that was well carbonated. Not sure the ""winter"" seasonal label is appropriate, as it is brewed and released in mid-summer."
DeGroens Helles;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Draught: Sampled at the CTRiver Brewers Festival. The beer pours a hazy golden color. Fairly typical malty, yeast nose. Good, balanced taste, but did I detect a hint of clove in there? A bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. Intriguing taste. I may have to try this again later. I thought this was good!
DeGroens Helles;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Draught at HolyokeBrew Fest: Poured a hazy golden hue. Yeasty malt nose. Sweet, pale malts, light to medium bodied, finishing yeasty with pleasant bitterness.
DeGroens Helles;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baltimore Brewing Co.;I'm not a huge fan of german lagers, but this was a very good, fresh tasting german lager. It was a hot day in Baltimore when I sampled this one, and it hit the spot. It has many of the typica helles (odd) flavors of licorice.
DeGroens Helles;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baltimore Brewing Co.;Sampled at the brewery. Probably their least satisfying offering. In previous years, this was malty and swell. This year's batch hadn't much flavor at all.
DeGroens Helles;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baltimore Brewing Co.;(Served from a growler) Very malty and light. The palate is dominated by malt. The beer finishes smooth with a touch of hops. Well crafted and yummy.
DeGroens Helles;Baltimore, Maryland, United States;Helles / Dortmunder Export;Baltimore Brewing Co.;nice bite in the finish, lots of character, good summer brew................
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;This I liked, but maybe too much alcohol. After a day of tasting I bumped into this. Slight fruity nose along with nice malting. Spicy finish. A tad too heavy on the carbonation (a critique, not a complaint).
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;The recently released 04 version of this seasonal brew has been kicked up to 8% abv. An unfiltered copper appearance with an average size head offered up the fruity banana esters of a typical hefe, complimented by a malty, earthy aroma. Nicely carbonated, with a smooth, medium-to-full bodied flavor with a long, slightly sweet, fruity finish. A worthy alternative to the proliferation of octoberfests around this time of year.
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Pale and cloudy in appearance with a small head. Aroma is sweet and mildly spiced. This beer is very smooth and creamy, reminding me strongly of a banana milkshake. My only complaint would be that this beer was a bit too sweet for me, although I didn't have any trouble finishing my glass. Overall, quite nice, but I think that next time I would have it with dessert rather than with my meal.
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;[On tap] Cloudy amber color. Strong clove and banana aroma, typical of the style. Excellent flavor profile filled the whole tongue. Perhaps a tad too sweet, but that's arguable. An excellent brew!
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Hazy light brown color with a very small head. Aroma of banana, and clove. Malty flavors accompanied by the banana and some spiciness. A decent offering.
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;"Very hazy amber colour with a thin tan head. Potent aroma of bananas, cloves and yeast. Medium to Light-bodied; Strong malty flavour with the added aformentioned sweetness. Aftertaste shows a lot of spiceyness: cloves, coriander seed and nutmeg. Overall, a nice weizen bock from the Mid-Atlantic! I had this on draught at the Pizza Plant in Buffalo, New York."
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;(Served via growler) Big banana and clove nose. The palate is nourishing with, a smooth mouth feel. The finish is full of malt and flavorful yeast. Tasty weizenbock.
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;An excellent beer with exceptional hints of banana and clove. There are many better Weizenbocks on the market, but the smooth, subtle hints that this beer gives make this more of a classic style of this beer.
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Sampled at brewery. Color of muddy water - half a week or so of additional lagering would not have hurt, bad head retention. Nice banana and clove with a good full body. Not quite up to par with the weizenbocks I have become used to here in Bavaria, but not bad either.
DeGroens Weizenbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Weizenbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Sampled at the brewery--good head over hazy light brown body. Fine, full mouthfeel with flavors of banana, clove and spice in huge quantities. I don't perceive some of the bubblegum flavors I've detected in previous years nor the piercing fruitiness I've had in the past for this one. Still, very nice.
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Bottle. Pours mahogany with some protein globules and a tan head. Smells of rich roasty malt, some light spicy undertones, some fruity hints. Tastes of chocolate, spicy, caramel, breaddy, some vegetal hints creep in on the finish.
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;I had a Fordham Doppelbock and am not sure if DeGroens is an inset of Fordham or what. This was a very solid Doppelbock. Basically one big malt bomb. I’ll agree with the previous rater that this isn’t going to replace a Celebrator but it is a solid tasty malty beer. Very nice.
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;March 2006 - For a dopplebock from Maryland, this isn’t half bad. Beer poured very dark brown with reddish highlights, a smallish head with some decent lacing. Flavor was caramel and roasty malts...sweet, but not overly so. A little hops balanced out the flavor, but mouthfeel a little thin. This isn’t going to full you into thinking it’s Celebrator or Maximator, but this is definitely better than other local attempts (*cough* Troegenator *cough*) I’ve had.
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;12oz bottle acquired in trade with bstill (thanks!). Poured a deeper mahogany color wtih a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of toasted nuts, bready and caramel. Tastes of caramel, nuts, brown sugar, cookie dough, and some dark fruits. Light to medium alcohol finish.
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Poured a brown color (some reddish edges) with a generous head that laced well. The aroma was most strongly of caramel, some bread, some nuts, and spices. Alcohol was also strong and readily detectable. Flavor was as busy as the aroma, but again the alcohol was too prominent and squashed an otherwise decent take on the style. Finish did not have enough hops to keep this thing honest. Mouthfeel was sticky sweet, somewhat syrup-like.
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Pours a transparent dark copper mahogany with a short-lived off-white head. Rich, toasty caramel malty, cookie dough aroma has a nice authentic German doppelbock character. Body starts with a sweet, viscous caramel sugar cookie flavor, with some earthy noble hoppy bitterness, mild metallic character and a drier, lingering warming finish. Overall, very authentic and well-made. Thanks to StewardofGondor for the chance to try this!
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Deep, translucent and ruby/garnet in color with a pillowy tan head that evaporates to a thin pond with a thicker wrung around the edges. Aroma is a moderate delicacy - chocolate hazelnuts and mocha amaretto. Deep, woodsy, and a bark-like earthen nuttiness. Some wafts of whole wheat chocolate dinner rolls, cocoa powder and toasted oak. Maple meets mildew, and brown sugar stirred in molasses reach the nose at the break of each sip. Big flavor bill to fill. Vibrantly thick substance oozes in while dusty milk chocolate and snapped pecan shells impart that nutty dimension. Toffee bar, Heath transcendence with a noble hop boost that projects a slightly noticeable alcohol presence. Thick and massive on the palate, churning as one fluid force, and quite oily at that. Vibrantly jovial and eager at the edges, but all the balance contributors seem to be acting according to plan. Chocolate encapsulated caramel chews, greasy mocha beans and a raw tree bark character enrich the ending, pursued by profoundly rich reverberations that ring long into the night. Big thanks to Bstill for the bottle!
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Poured a reddish amber color with a medium sized, creamy, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malts, roast, cereal, smoke and light citrus hoppiness as well. Caramel, toasted malt, earth, roast and light alcohol in the finish. Creamy mouthfeel.
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Another selection from the GABF. I was in search for all the dopplebocks I could get my hands on. Dark color with good head and lacing. A sweet malty carmel taste that was very smooth. An extremely good tasting beer.
DeGroens Doppelbock;Dover, Delaware, United States;Bock - Doppelbock;Fordham & Dominion Brewing Company;Deep copper and browns with a fluffy tan head. Lot of dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, and fresh baked bread. Rich, without being overly sweet. This batch didn't show any of the ABV. On tap at Degroens, declared as 9% if I recall. Medium to full bodied, nice soft carbonation. Quite smooth and drinkable. Worth a try if in Charm City.
Petes Wicked Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Backlog, bottle with Pat in 2009 or 10. Poured a dark amber with a small to medium off white head. Raisins, fig, nuts, and roasted malt was the main tasting notes. Overall, its ok but the mouthfeel was a bit too thin for me.
Petes Wicked Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Petes Brewing Company;This tasted like a honey brown to me. Lots of sweet malty flavors like honey and caramel. Hops are barely noticable. I prefer my browns to have a hint of hops, but overall this had a good decent flavor. Appearance on the medium brown-amber side, with a smooth easy-drinkability mouthfeel. Probably more of a daytime/summer beer IMO.
Petes Wicked Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Not a very good brown ale. One of the first non-macro brews I ever tried. Light and very mild. Almost nothing to it.
Petes Wicked Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Petes Brewing Company;"From Oct 2006 Poured from 12oz bottle a clear reddish brown with about a 1"" head of foam that shrank almost immediately to a fine layer with little lacing. The smell is pretty subtle but there *is* a caramel sweetness there. The taste has the caramel sweetness from the malt noted in the nose but it, too, is on the subtle side. I also can just detect a bit of fruitiness but it's hard for me to identify it...maybe prune? The finish is kind of on the cornie side... Not much really going on here for an English style Brown ale. It'll probably be a while before I buy this brew again."
Petes Wicked Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Backlog rating Tucson trip 2006: Chestnut, creamy brown head. Fairly nutty aroma, herbal edges. Fruity malt base. Nuts, heather, a few berries, a bit leather. Sparkly mouthfeel.

Petes Wicked Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Originally rated on 2/9/09. A reddish brown body, not much head, only sparse lace left behind. Aroma and flavor of malt, slightly sweet. Not bad, but not good either, pretty average beer.

Petes Wicked Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Petes Brewing Company;This is the beer that got me started exploring the craft beer movment in California. I remember when it was only on tap in Los Angeles and the bay area. It will always be fondly remembered as an institution. Not the best beer, but it was my go to beer. Totally smashable. Miss you guys.
Petes Wicked Ale;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Brown Ale;Petes Brewing Company;Old rating. Bottle from Old Town. Pours a dark amber with a modest soapy beige head. Aromas of cherry, roasted malt and molasses. Body is a little thin and the mouthfeel a little syrupy. Some tartness from the fruit and sweetness from the malts are present and fairly well-balanced.
Petes Wicked Honey Wheat;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Petes Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Cloudy amber color with a rocky beige head. Yeasty wheat malt nose. Dry toasted malt flavor hints at lemon peel. Dry hop finish.
Petes Wicked Honey Wheat;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Petes Brewing Company;"petes has a decent reputation among macro drinkers, but as a whole, their beers are entirely avoidable, and this is no exception. The honey is a nice touch, but you can barely tell it’s there. Not enough."""
Petes Wicked Honey Wheat;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Petes Brewing Company;12oz bottle (Old Notes)-Pours a clear light amber with a small head. Aroma of sweetness and malt. Taste of the same with some honey coming through. No wheat anywhere. This light bodied brew is not too shabby.

Hazy golden body with lots of bubbly carbonation and generous white head that lasts forever. Lightly sweet flavour has some doughy characteristics and citrus notes with very light bitterness. Strong carbonation to the light, refreshing body. Sampled in Dallas, 2001. Bottle. Entered from notes.
Petes Wicked Honey Wheat;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Petes Brewing Company;A favorite of mine from the past. Pete’s was a gateway brand for me. One of the few honey brews I have tried that has a honey flavor that actually worked. I remember buying a bomber of this one time and going to a friends baseball league at a local high school. They got kicked out of the league because I was drinking this in the dugout. Good times.
Petes Wicked Honey Wheat;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Wheat Ale;Petes Brewing Company;A very sweet sugar flavor, that I guess is supposed to be the honey. Light and sweet overall, not too great, tastes like an artificial blend of cane sugar and malts.
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;From old tasting notes. Honey gold color. Big foamy beige head. Pleasant strawberry fruit aroma. Nice sweet malt flavor hints at berries and clover. Zesty bittersweet hop finish.
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;From back when I first started drinking beer in college. Kind of an artificial strawberry flavor on a rather basic blonde ale base.
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;"To quote Homer Simpson when he finds out Greystache died : ""No man should outlive his fictional wizard"". I feel Homer’s pain as another mystical beer that I have enjoyed is gone from my life.

Grainy aromas, with some malt and a faint hint of strawberry. Light and refreshing. Thin body, watery on the palate with little flavor to speak of. Some malt sweetness comes out though.
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;"""for a lighter (blonde) beer, the aroma and taste, while still light, sure are a little harsh. barely detectable sweet strawberry aftertaste. really not worth buying, but then again, i haven’t had a Pete’s beer yet that was."""
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;12oz bottle 5/30/14 (Old Notes)-Pours a golden yellowish copper with a small head. Aroma of light strawberry. Taste the same with slight malt. This light bodied brew is not bad.
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;Petes Wicked Ales were some of the first craft/non-Bud style beers that started me on the road to realy good beer. This one poured a clean and clear, golden color with a thin white head that faded quickly. The aroma was a pleasant blend of light malts, wheat and strawberries. The flavors were light and subdued. Light malts, light wheat, light honey sweetness and some tart strawberries. The body was light with a slick texture and very little carbonation. Overall it was a good summery beer.
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked 09220-0832. I do not know how old this bottle is because it came with a coat of dust on a shelf in the corner of a convenience store. But it is a copper-yellow color with busy carbonation building up to a quick fizzy head. Strawberry notes are predominant on the nose with some vaguely roasted malts and a slight hop feel. Smooth and creamy body. The strawberry was not as obvious in the taste. It tended to have a buttery, malty flavor. I think this was an older bottle b ut it seemed to hold its own alright.
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;Appearance- A golden yellow with a tint of orange, poured white head that quickly dissipated Aroma- Fresh and clean with a hint of berry T/P - Nice sweet taste very very slight strawberry/berry flavor not bad if you don’t mind a fruit beer. very smooth almost reminds me more of a cider than a beer Overall- Not a bad beer, not the best but not bad. Would be very good on a hot summer day at a BBQ
Petes Wicked Strawberry Blonde;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Flavored - Fruit;Petes Brewing Company;I think this is the starter beer for people looking to try one with fruit.

Petes Wicked Pub Lager;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Petes Brewing Company;Bottle. I had this in a multi-pack back in 1999 or 2000 and loved it. I thought at the time that it was the best beer that I had ever tasted. It’s been a while, and I can’t be sure if I was right, but I remember a nice hop and maltiness with an amber color. Can’t recall the aroma, probably because I drank it too fast...
Petes Wicked Pub Lager;San Antonio, Texas, United States;Pale Lager - North Am. / Light;Petes Brewing Company;This is something thats not offensive, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase any.
